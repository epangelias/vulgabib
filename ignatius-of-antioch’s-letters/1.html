                    <p>Epistle of Ignatius to the Ephesians: Ignatius, who is also called Theophorus, to the Church of Ephesus in Asia, blessed of God the Father, and Jesus Christ our Saviour.</p>
<p>I have been granted a great gift, in that the Ephesians have been sealed in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, and in the name of the Apostles.</p>
<p>I heard of your amor (love) in the Spirit, and I have cause to glorify God, that I was allowed to bear the nome (name) of Christ, and to be bound for His sake.</p>
<p>I have been condemned, and I am now in the midst of the vinum (wine) press; but I am not yet perfect in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>I am in the midst of the Ephesians, who are ardent in the Spirit, and who are noun (name) bearers of the Apostles, and are sanctified in the Apostles.</p>
<p>I am a scriba (scribe), and I am not worthy to be called a discipulus (disciple) of Paul, for he was a participe (participant) in the Council of the Apostles.</p>
<p>I am a condemned man, and I am not worthy to be called a martyr, for I am not yet perfect in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>I am only a servant, and I am not worthy to be called a bishop, for I am not yet perfect in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>You are the stones of the temple of the Father, elect and precious, and you are the pillars of the Church, and your faith is grounded in the apostolica (apostolic) doctrine.</p>
<p>You are the porta (gate) of the Church, and you are the via (way) of those who are saved, and you are the porta (gate) of the kingdom of heaven.</p>
