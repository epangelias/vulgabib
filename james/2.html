                    <p>My brethren, have not the fides amongst you, rich in glory, and the pauper in humility?</p>
<p>If a aureus ring comes into your coetus, and if a pauper in vile habitus, and you have respect to him that wears the aureus ring, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place, and say to the pauper, Stand thou there, or sit here under my scabellum:</p>
<p>Haven't you made distinctio amongst yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?</p>
<p>Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not Deus chosen the pauper of this mundo rich in fides, and heirs of the regnum which He hath promised to them that love Him?</p>
<p>If ye fulfil the regnum of the law, thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, thou dost commit peccatum, and art convinced of the law as a transgressor.</p>
<p>For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.</p>
<p>For he that said, Do not adulterium, said also, Do not homicide. Now if thou commit no adulterium, yet if thou homicidae, thou art become a transgressor of the law.</p>
<p>So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of libertas.</p>
<p>For he shall have iudicium without misericordia, that hath shewed no misericordia; and misericordia rejoiceth against iudicium.</p>
<p>What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath fides, and have not operis? can fides save him?</p>
<p>If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily bread,</p>
<p>And one of you say unto them, Depart in pace, be warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are necessaria to the body; what doth it profit?</p>
<p>Even so fides, if it hath not operis, is dead, being alone.</p>
<p>Yea, a man may say, Thou hast fides, and I have operis: shew me thy fides without thy operis, and I will shew thee my fides by my operis.</p>
<p>Thou believest that there is one Deus; thou doest well: the demons also believe, and tremble.</p>
<p>But wilt thou know, O vain man, that fides without operis is dead?</p>
<p>Was not Abraham our pater justified by operis, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?</p>
<p>Seest thou how fides wrought with his operis, and by operis was fides made perfect?</p>
<p>And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed Deus, and it was imputed unto him for iustitia; and he was called the Friend of Deus.</p>
<p>Ye see then how that by operis a man is justified, and not by fides only.</p>
<p>Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by operis, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?</p>
<p>For as the body without the spirit is dead, so fides without operis is dead also.</p>
