                    <p>1 And this is the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of Deus blessed the filii Israel before he died.</p>
<p>2 And he said, Iahveh came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir unto them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands of sancti, at his right hand was the ignis of the law.</p>
<p>3 Yea, he loved the populus; all his sancti are in thy manus: and they sat down at thy pedes, every one shall receive of thy verba.</p>
<p>4 Moses commanded us a lex, even the hereditas of the congregation of Iacob.</p>
<p>5 And he was king in Ieshurun, when the caput of the populus were gathered, and the tribes of Israel were assembled.</p>
<p>6 Let Reuben live, and not die; and let not his homines be few.</p>
<p>7 And this is the blessing of Iudah: and he said, Hear, Iahveh, the vox of Iudah, and bring him unto his populus: let his manus be sufficient for him; and be thou an auxilium to him from his enemies.</p>
<p>8 And of Levi he said, Let thy Thummim and thy Urim be with thy sanctus, whom thou provasti at Massah, and with whom thou contendedst at the waters of Meribah;</p>
<p>9 Who said unto his pater and to his mater, I have not seen him; neither did he acknowledge his fratres, nor knew his own filii: for they have observed thy verbum, and kept thy pactum.</p>
<p>10 They shall teach Iacob thy iudicia, and Israel thy lex: they shall put incensum before thy facies, and holocaustum upon thine altare.</p>
<p>11 Bless, Iahveh, his virtus, and accept the opus of his manus: smite through the lumbi of them that rise up against him, and of them that hate him, that they rise not again.</p>
<p>12 And of Beniamin he said, The dilectus of Iahveh shall dwell in securitate by him; and Iahveh shall cover him all the die, and he shall dwell between his umeri.</p>
<p>13 And of Ioseph he said, Blessed of Iahveh be his terra, for the dona of the caelum from above, and for the rores of the abyssus that lieth beneath;</p>
<p>14 And for the fruges of the solis, and for the dona of the lunae,</p>
<p>15 And for the summitates of the montes of the aevum, and for the dona of the colles of the sempiternum:</p>
<p>16 And for the dona of the terra, and the plenitudo thereof, and for the beneplacitum of him that dwelt in the rubus: let it come upon the caput of Ioseph, and upon the vertex of the Nazareus among his fratres.</p>
<p>17 His dignitas is like the primogeniti of his boves, and his cornua are like the cornua of the unicornis: with them he shall cornu the gentes, even to the fines of the terra: and they are the myriades of Ephraim, and they are the milia of Manasse.</p>
<p>18 And of Zabulon he said, Rejoice, Zabulon, in thy going out; and thou, Issachar, in thy tabernacles.</p>
<p>19 They shall call the populus unto the montem; there they shall offer sacrificia of iustitia: for they shall suck of the abundantia of the mari, and of the thesauri hidden in the arena.</p>
<p>20 And of Gad he said, Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad: he dwelleth as a leo, and teareth the membrum of the armum, and the vertex of the caput.</p>
<p>21 And he provided the prima pars for himself, because there, in a partem of the lexgiver, was he seated; and he came with the caput of the populus, he executed the iustitia of Iahveh, and his iudicia with Israel.</p>
<p>22 And of Dan he said, Dan is a lupus solitarius; he shall also rise from Bashan.</p>
<p>23 And of Nephthali he said, O Nephthali, satisfied with favorem, and full of the benedictio of Iahveh: possess thou the mari and the meridies;</p>
<p>24 And of Aser he said, Aser, thy frumentum shall be abundantia, and he shall yield frumentum unto the reges, and thy pedes shall be dipt in oleum.</p>
<p>25 Thy balteus shall be of ferrum, and of aes thy ligamina: and thy fortitudo shall be equal to the dies of thy vita.</p>
<p>26 There is none like unto the Deus Ieshurun, who rideth upon the caelum in thy auxilium, and in his maiestate upon the nubes.</p>
<p>27 The Deus of the aevum is thy refugium, and underneath are the brachia of the sempiternum: and he shall thrust out the inimicum from before thy facies, saying, Disperde.</p>
<p>28 Israel then shall dwell in securitate alone: the fons of Iacob shall be upon a terra of grano and vini; also his caelum shall distill the rores of the oleum.</p>
<p>29 Happy art thou, O Israel: who is like unto thee, O populus saved by Iahveh, the scutum of thy auxilium, and who is the gladius of thy maiestate? and thine inimici shall be found liars unto thee; and thou shalt tread upon their altare.</p>
