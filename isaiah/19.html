                    <p>The burden of Aegyptus. Behold, the Lord rideth upon a swift nubis, and cometh to Aegyptus: and the idola of Aegyptus shall be moved at his presence, and the cor of Aegyptus shall melt in the midst of it.</p>
<p>And I will set the Aegyptii against the Aegyptii: and they shall fight every one against his frater, and every one against his proximus; civitas against civitas, and regnum against regnum.</p>
<p>And the spirit of Aegyptus shall fail in the midst of it; and I will destroy the consilium thereof: and they shall seek to the idola, and to the augures, and to the pythonissis, and to the arioli.</p>
<p>And the Aegyptii will deliver the Aegyptii into the manus of cruces: and the terram of Aegyptus shall be desolata, and spolium.</p>
<p>And the nautae of the maris shall be confusus, and all that earn their panem on the mare, shall be confusus.</p>
<p>And all the fons of the fluvii of Aegyptus shall be dried up; and the flumina shall be wasted and dried up.</p>
<p>The papyrus and the carex shall wither away: they shall be cut off, and be consumed.</p>
<p>The piscatores also shall mourn, and all they that cast the hamus in flumine, and they that spread the rete upon the faciem of the mare shall languish.</p>
<p>Moreover they that operant lanam, and they that texunt linum, shall be confusus.</p>
<p>And all the textores of the gremium shall be contristati: for the pretium of the mercimonia shall be taken away from them.</p>
<p>And the principes of Tanis are caligati: the sapientes consiliarii of Pharaonem have given consilium ineptum: how do you say unto Pharaonem, I am the filius of the sapientes, the filius of the reges of antiquis?</p>
<p>Where are your sapientes? let them indicare tibi now: and let them know what the Lord of the exercituum hath purposed upon Aegyptum.</p>
<p>The principes of Tanis are caligati; the principes of Memphis are deceived: they that are the cornerstones of the tribus have caused Aegyptum to err.</p>
<p>The Lord hath mingled a spirit of perversi in the midst thereof: and they have caused Aegyptum to err in every opus thereof, as a ebrius staggereth in his vomitus.</p>
<p>Neither shall there be any opus for Aegyptum, which the caput or the cauda, whose brachium or whose latera may do.</p>
<p>In that die shall the Aegyptii be like unto mulieres: and they shall tremble and be afraid because of the motion of the manus of the Lord of the exercituum, which he shaketh over them.</p>
<p>And the terra of Iudaea shall be a terrae for Aegyptus in that die: which shall be for a sign of testimonium of the Lord of the exercituum to the faciem of the Lord of the exercituum in the terra of the Aegyptii.</p>
<p>And it shall be for a signum and for testimonium unto the Lord of the exercituum in the terra of Aegyptus: for they shall cry unto the Lord because of the oppressores, and he shall send them a salvator, and a prince, and he shall deliver them.</p>
<p>And the Lord shall be known to Aegyptus in that die; and the Aegyptii shall acknowledge the Lord in that die, and shall colere victimas, and facere vota unto the Lord, and facere eos.</p>
<p>And the Lord shall smite Aegyptus: he shall smite and heal it: and they shall return unto the Lord, and he shall be placatus unto them, and shall heal them.</p>
<p>In that die shall there be a via from Aegyptus unto the Assyrii, and the Assyrii shall come into Aegyptus, and the Aegyptii into the Assyrii; and the Aegyptii shall serve cum the Assyrii.</p>
<p>In that die shall Israel be the tertius cum the Aegyptiis and cum the Assyrii, a benedictio in medio terrae:</p>
<p>Whom the Lord of the exercituum shall benedicere, saying, Benedictus populus meus Aegyptii, and the opus of my manuum Assyrii, and the hereditas mea Israel.</p>
<p>In that die shall there be an altare unto the Lord in the medio terrae of Aegyptus, and a titulus ad portam thereof unto the Lord.</p>
<p>And it shall be for a signum and for testimonium unto the Lord of the exercituum in the terra of the Aegyptii: for they shall cry unto the Lord because of the oppressores, and he shall send them a salvator, and a prince, and he shall deliver them.</p>
<p>And the Lord shall know Aegyptus in that die, and the Aegyptii shall acknowledge the Lord, and shall facere sacrificia, and facere vota unto the Lord, and facere eos.</p>
<p>And the Lord shall smite Aegyptus, smiting and healing; and they shall return unto the Lord, and he shall be placatus unto them, and shall heal them.</p>
