  "The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them: and the desert shall rejoice, and the solitudo shall blossom as the rosa.",
  "It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with gaudeo: the glory of Libanus shall be given unto it, the excellent beauty of Carmelus and Saron, they shall see the glory of the Lord, and the magnificentia of our God.",
  "Strengthen the manus that are feeble, and confirm the genua that are weak.",
  "Say to them that are of a fearful cor: Be comforted, fear not: behold, your God will come with vengeance, even God with a retributio to save you.",
  "Then the oculi of caeci shall be opened, and the aures of surdi shall be unstopped.",
  "Then shall the claudus leap as a cervus, and the lingua of the mutes shall sing: for in the desert shall waters flow, and the flumen in the solitudo.",
  "And the miry place shall become a piscina of aqua: and the thirsty terra shall become fontes of aqua: in the habitation of dracones, where each lay, shall be an habitation of reeds and papyrus.",
  "And an elevated via shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called the Via Sancta: the immundus shall not pass over it; but it shall be for those: the viatores, even the foolish, shall not err therein.",
  "No leo shall be there, nor any of the ferocious bestiae shall go up thereon, it shall not be found there; but the redeemed shall walk there:",
  "And the redempti of the Lord shall return, and come with laus to Sion; and eternal gaudeo shall be upon their caput: they shall obtain gaudeo and laus; and sorrow and suspirium shall flee away."
