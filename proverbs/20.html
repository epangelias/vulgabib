                    <p>Wine is a mocker, vinum est derisor, strong drink is raging: potus fortis est tumultus: whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise, quicumque deceptus fuerit ab eo non est sapiens.</p>
<p>The king's wrath is as the roaring of a lion: ira regis est sicut rugitus leonis: who provoketh him to anger sinneth against his own soul, qui provocat eum ad iram peccat contra animam suam.</p>
<p>It is an honour for a man to cease from strife: est honor homini cessare a lite: but every fool will be meddling, sed omnis stultus se immiscet.</p>
<p>The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold: piger non arabit propter frigus: therefore shall he beg in harvest, et rogabit in messe, and have nothing, et nihil habebit.</p>
<p>Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water: consilium in corde viri est sicut aqua profunda: but a man of understanding will draw it out, sed vir intelligens exhauriet illud.</p>
<p>Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness: multi annuntiabunt unicuique suam bonitatem: but a faithful man who can find, sed vir fidelis quis inveniet?</p>
<p>The just man walketh in his integrity: iustus in innocentia sua ambulat: his children are blessed after him, filii eius beatos post eum.</p>
<p>The king that faithfully judgeth the poor, rex qui iudicio liberat pauperes, his throne shall be established for ever, thronus eius aeternus erit.</p>
<p>Chasten thy son while there is hope, castiga filium tuum dum est spes, and let not thy soul spare for his crying, et noli parcere animae tuae propter clamorem eius.</p>
<p>A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment: vir irae multae punietur: for if thou deliver him, yet thou must do it again, si enim liberaveris eum iterum reddes.</p>
<p>Hear counsel, and receive instruction, audi consilium et accipe disciplinam, that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end, ut sis sapiens in novissimis tuis.</p>
<p>There is a wicked device in the heart of the scorner, est machinatio pessima in corde derisoris, and the counsel of the upright is wisdom, et consilium rectorum sapientia est.</p>
<p>The wicked devise against the just, impii machinantur contra iustos, and gnash upon him with his teeth, et stridunt super eum dentibus suis.</p>
<p>But the Lord shall laugh at him: sed Dominus subsannabit eum: for he seeth that his day is coming, quia videt quia venit dies eius.</p>
<p>The wicked have drawn out the sword, impii evaginaverunt gladium, and have bent their bow, et tetenderunt arcum suum, to cast down the poor and needy, ut interficiant pauperem et egenum, and to slay such as be of upright conversation, et ut interficiant rectos gressibus suis.</p>
<p>Their sword shall enter into their own heart, gladius eorum ingredietur in cor suum, and their bows shall be broken, et arcus eorum confringentur.</p>
<p>A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many wicked, melior est modica iusti quam divitiae multorum impiorum.</p>
<p>For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: brachia enim impiorum confringentur: but the righteous shall be upheld by the Lord, iusti autem a Domino fulcibuntur.</p>
<p>The Lord will not leave the righteous: non derelinquet Dominus iustos: but the wicked and his thoughts the Lord hateth, impios autem et cogitationes eorum odit.</p>
<p>To have respect of persons is not good: non est bonum habere personarum acceptationem: for for a piece of bread that man will transgress, quia pro pane hominis transgredietur.</p>
<p>A wicked man hardeneth his face: impius indurat faciem suam, but as for the upright, he directeth his way, iustus autem diriget viam suam.</p>
<p>There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the Lord, non est sapientia nec intellectus nec consilium contra Dominum.</p>
<p>The horse is prepared against the day of battle: equus praeparatur ad diem proelii: but safety is of the Lord, salus autem Domini est.</p>
<p>The king's heart is in the hand of the Lord, cor regis in manu Domini est, as the rivers of water: sicut flumina aquarum: he turneth it whithersoever he will, quocumque voluerit inclinabit illud.</p>
<p>Every way of man is right in his own eyes: omnis via hominis recta est in oculis suis: but the Lord pondereth the hearts, Dominus autem appendit corda.</p>
<p>To do justice and judgment is more acceptable to the Lord than sacrifice, facere iustitiam et iudicium acceptius est Domino quam sacrificium.</p>
<p>The fear of the Lord tendeth to life: timor Domini tendit ad vitam, and he that hath it shall abide satisfied, et qui habet eam satiabitur: he shall not be visited with evil, et non visitabitur a malo.</p>
<p>A wicked man is loathsome, impius foetidus est, and cometh not at all into the king's presence, et non veniet in conspectu regis.</p>
<p>The king's wrath is as the roaring of a lion, ira regis sicut rugitus leonis: but his favour is as dew upon the grass, favorem autem eius sicut ros super herbam.</p>
<p>A foolish son is the calamity of his father, filius stultus calamitas patris sui est: and the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping, et iurgia uxoris stillatio continua.</p>
<p>House and riches are the inheritance of fathers, hereditas patrum domus et divitiae: and a prudent wife is from the Lord, uxor autem prudens a Domino donata est.</p>
<p>The slothful hideth his hand in his bosom, piger abscondit manum suam in sinu suo: and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again, et nolens trahere eam ad os suum reducere.</p>
<p>Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware: deride scurra, et simplex caveat: and reprove one that hath understanding, et arguas intellegentem et intellegit.</p>
<p>He that wasteth his father, and chaseth away his mother, qui dissipat patrem et fugat matrem, is a son that causeth shame, et filius qui confundit, and bringeth reproach, et adducit ignominiam.</p>
<p>Cease, my son, to hear the instruction that causeth to err from the words of knowledge, desine fili mi audire disciplinam quae errare facit a verbis scientiae.</p>
<p>An ungodly witness scorneth judgment: testis impiae deridet iudicium: and the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity, et os impiorum devorat iniquitatem.</p>
<p>Judgments are prepared for scorners, iudicia parata sunt derisoribus, and stripes for the back of fools, et plagae dorsis stultorum.</p>
<p>Wine is a mocker, vinum est derisor, strong drink is raging: potus fortis est tumultus: whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise, quicumque deceptus fuerit ab eo non est sapiens.</p>
