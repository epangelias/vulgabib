                    <p>In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa, Baasha rex Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa rex Judah.</p>
<p>Then Asa rex Judah took all Judah, and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha had builded, and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.</p>
<p>And at that time Hanani the prophet came to Asa rex Judah, and said unto him, Because thou hast relied on the rex Syria, and not relied on the Dominus Deus thy Deus, therefore is the host of the rex Syria escaped out of thine hand.</p>
<p>Were not the Aethiopes and the Libyes a huge host, with very many chariots and equites? yet, because thou reliedst on the Dominus, he delivered them into thine hand.</p>
<p>For the oculi of the Dominus run to and fro throughout the whole terra, to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose cor is perfect toward him. Herein thou hast done foolishly: therefore from henceforth thou shalt have bella.</p>
<p>Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in the carcer, for he was in a great furor with him because of this thing. And Asa oppressed some of the populus the same time.</p>
<p>And, behold, the historia of Asa, first and last, lo, they are written in the libro of the reges of Judah and Israel.</p>
<p>And Asa slept with his patres, and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign.</p>
<p>And they buried him in his sepulchre, which he had made for himself in the civitas of David, and laid him in the bed, which was filled with aromata and divers kinds of specie, which they prepared according to art: and they made a very great exsequias for him.</p>
