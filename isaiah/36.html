                    <p>1 Then the king of Assyria sent the Tartanum, the Rabsaris, and the Rabshakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great army against Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they were come up, they came and stood by the aqueduct of the upper pool, which is in the highway of the fuller's field.</p>
<p>2 And the Rabshakeh said unto them, Speak ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein thou trustest?</p>
<p>3 I say, sayest thou, (but they are but vain words) I have counsel and strength for war: now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me?</p>
<p>4 Lo, thou trustest in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt; whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust in him.</p>
<p>5 But if thou say to me, We trust in the Dominus our God: is it not he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem?</p>
<p>6 Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my lord the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand equites, that thou mayest set on thyself to ride on them.</p>
<p>7 How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my lord's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for equites?</p>
<p>8 Am I now come up without the Dominus against this land to destroy it? The Dominus said unto me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.</p>
<p>9 Then said Hezekiah's servants unto the Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, unto thy servants in the Syrian tongue; for we understand it: and speak not unto us in the Jews' language, in the ears of the people that are on the wall.</p>
<p>10 Then the Rabshakeh said, Hath my lord sent me to thy lord, and to thee, to speak these words? and not to the men that sit upon the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own urine with you?</p>
<p>11 Then Hezekiah's servants said unto the Rabshakeh, I pray thee, speak unto us in the Syrian tongue; and speak not unto us in the Jews' language, in our ears.</p>
<p>12 But the Rabshakeh said, Hath my lord sent me to thy lord, and to thee, to speak these words? and not to the men that sit upon the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own urine with you?</p>
<p>13 Then the Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and spake, saying, Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria.</p>
<p>14 Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you out of mine hand.</p>
<p>15 Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the Dominus, saying, The Dominus shall surely deliver us, and this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.</p>
<p>16 Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make an agreement with me by a blessing, and come out to me, and then eat ye every man of his own vine, and every one of his own fig tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern:</p>
<p>17 Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive oil and of honey, that ye may live, and not die: and hearken not unto Hezekiah, when he persuadeth you, saying, The Dominus shall deliver us.</p>
<p>18 Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?</p>
<p>19 Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah? have they delivered Samaria out of mine hand?</p>
<p>20 Who are they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of mine hand, that the Dominus should deliver Jerusalem out of mine hand?</p>
<p>21 But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not.</p>
<p>22 Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of the Rabshakeh.</p>
