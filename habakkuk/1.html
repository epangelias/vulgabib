                    <p>1. O Domine, how long shall I cry for help, and thou wilt not hear? even cry out unto thee of violentia, and thou wilt not save?</p>
<p>2. Why dost thou shew me iniquitas, and causest me to behold afflictio? for spoilia and violentia are before me: and there are that raise up strife and contention.</p>
<p>3. Therefore the lex is slacked, and iudicium doth never go forth: for the impious doth compass about the iustus; therefore wrong iudicium proceedeth.</p>
<p>4. Behold, ye shall not see iniquitas: but every one turneth to his own via, every one for his own lucrum, from the smallest of them even unto the greatest of them every one is given to avaritia.</p>
<p>5. Behold among the gentes, and regard, and wonder marvellously: for I will work a work in your dies, which ye shall not believe, though it be told you.</p>
<p>6. For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hastigens gens, which shall march through the latitudinem of the terra, to possess the tabernacula that are not their's.</p>
<p>7. They are terrible and dreadful: their iudicium and their auctoritas shall proceed of themselves.</p>
<p>8. Their equi also are swifter than leones, and are more fiercer than lupi in the evening: and their equites shall be spread abroad: yea, their equites shall come from far; they shall fly as the aquila that hasteth to devour.</p>
<p>9. They shall come all for violentia: their facies shall sup up as the ventus, and they shall gather the captivitas as the arena: and they shall scoff at reges, and princes shall be a scorn unto them: the munition of the fortis shall be a scorn unto them.</p>
<p>10. Because the intentio of their animus is against thee: they shall gather the captivitas, and they shall make a heap, and lay it under the ferrum, as the terra into the lake.</p>
<p>11. Then shall his animus change, and he shall pass over, and offend, imputing this his potentia unto his deus.</p>
<p>12. Art thou not from the principio, O Domine my Deus, my Sanctus? we shall not die. O Domine, thou hast ordained them for iudicium; and, O fortis Deus, thou hast established them for correction.</p>
<p>13. Thou art of purer oculi than to behold malum, and canst not look on afflictio: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, and holdest thy tongue when the impious devoureth the iustus?</p>
<p>14. And makest men as the pisces of the mari, as the reptilia, that have no dominus.</p>
<p>15. They take up all of them with the hamus, they catch them in their net, and gather them in their rete: therefore they rejoice and are glad.</p>
<p>16. Therefore they sacrifice unto their rete, and burn incense unto their hamus; because by them their portio is made fat, and their cibus plenteous.</p>
<p>17. Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to slay the gentes?</p>
