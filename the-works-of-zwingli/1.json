  "In principio, God created the caelum and the terra.",
  "And the terra was without forma, and void; and tenebrae was upon the facies of the profundum. And the Spiritus of God moved upon the facies of the aquae.",
  "The Spiritus of God moved upon the facies of the aquae. And God said, Fiat lux; and there was lux.",
  "And God saw the lux, that it was bonum: and God divided the lux from the tenebrae.",
  "And God called the lux Dies, and the tenebrae he called Nox. And there was vespere, and there was mane: dies unus.",
  "And God said, Fiat firmamentum in medio aquarum, and let it divide the aquae from the aquae.",
  "And God made the firmamentum, and divided the aquae which were subter from the aquae which were super.",
  "And God called the firmamentum Caelum. And there was vespere, and there was mane: dies secundus.",
  "And God said, Congregentur aquae quae subter caelum sunt in locum unum, and let the terra appear.",
  "And it was so. And God called the terra Terram, and the congregations of aquae he called Maria.",
  "And God saw that it was bonum.",
  "And God said, Germinet terra herbam virentem, and faciens semen, and lignum pomiferum faciens fructum iuxta genus suum, cuius semen in semetipso sit super terram.",
  "And it was so.",
  "And the terra produxit herbam virentem, and lignum faciens semen iuxta genus suum, and lignum pomiferum faciens fructum, et habens semen secundum genus suum super terram.",
  "And God saw that it was bonum.",
  "And there was vespere, and there was mane: dies tertius.",
  "And God said, Fiant luminaria in firmamento caeli, and let them be for signa, and for tempora, and for dies, and anni.",
  "And let them be for luminaria in firmamento caeli, and let them shine super terram.",
  "And it was so.",
  "And God made duo luminaria majora: luminaria maius, ut praeesset diei, and luminaria minus, ut praeesset nocti: et fecit stellas.",
  "And God posuit ea in firmamento caeli, ut lucerent super terram,",
  "And ut praeessent diei, et nocti, and to divide the lucem from the tenebris.",
  "And God saw that it was bonum.",
  "And there was vespere, and there was mane: dies quartus."
