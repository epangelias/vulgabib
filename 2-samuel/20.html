                    <p>1 Then there happened to be there a rebellio of the homines, and his name was Sheba the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a bucina, and said, We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tentes, O Israel.</p>
<p>2 So every man of Israel went from David and followed Sheba the son of Bichri: but the homines of Judah clave unto their rex from Jordan even to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>3 And David came to his domus at Jerusalem; and the rex took the decem concubines, whom he had left to keep the domus, and put them in a state of custodia, and fed them, but went not in unto them. So they were shut up unto the day of their morte, living in viduitas.</p>
<p>4 Then said the rex to Amasa, Assemble me the milites of Judah within tres dies, and be thou here present.</p>
<p>5 So Amasa went to assemble the milites of Judah: but he tarried longer than the tempus which he had appointed him.</p>
<p>6 And David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri do us more malum than did Absalom: take thou therefore the servientes of thy domine, and pursue after him, lest he find for himself civitates munitae, and escape us.</p>
<p>7 And there went out after him Joab's milites, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and all the milites: and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.</p>
<p>8 When they were at the grande petra which is by Gibeon, Amasa went before them: and Joab's vestis that he had put on was girded unto him, and upon it a balteus with a gladius fastened upon his renes in the right side, and as he went forth it fell out.</p>
<p>9 And Joab said to Amasa, Art thou in pace, my brother? And Joab took Amasa by the barba with the right manus to kiss him.</p>
<p>10 But Amasa took no heed to the gladius that was in Joab's manus: so he smote him therewith in the fifth costam, and shed out his intestina to the terra, and struck him not again; and he died. So Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri.</p>
<p>11 And one of Joab's homines stood by him, and said, He that favoureth Joab, and he that is for David, let him follow Joab.</p>
<p>12 And Amasa wallowed in sanguis in the midst of the via. And when the vir saw that all the populus stood still, he removed Amasa out of the via into the field, and cast a vestis upon him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still.</p>
<p>13 When he was removed out of the via, every man passed on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.</p>
<p>14 And he went through all the tribus of Israel unto Abel, and to Beth-maachah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered together, and went also after him.</p>
<p>15 And they came and besieged him in Abel of Beth-maachah, and they cast up a munition against the civitas, and it stood in the fossa: and all the populus that were with Joab battered the paries, to throw it down.</p>
<p>16 Then cried a sapientissima mulier out of the civitas, Hear, hear; say, I pray you, unto Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with thee.</p>
<p>17 And when he was come near unto her, the mulier said, Art thou Joab? And he said, I am he. Then she said unto him, Hear the words of thy handmaid. And he said, I do hear.</p>
<p>18 Then she spake, saying, They were wont to speak in olden time, saying, They shall surely ask counsel at Abel: and so they ended the matter.</p>
<p>19 I am one of them that are pacifici and fideles in Israel: thou seekest to destroy a civitas and a matrix of Israel. Why wilt thou swallow up the hereditas of the Lord?</p>
<p>20 And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy.</p>
<p>21 The matter is not so: but a vir of mount Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, hath lifted up his manus against the rex, against David: deliver him only, and I will depart from the civitas. And the mulier said unto Joab, Behold, his caput shall be thrown to thee over the murus.</p>
<p>22 Then the mulier went unto all the populus in her sapientia. And they cut off the caput of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast it out to Joab. And he blew a bucina, and they retired from the civitas, every man to his tentes. And Joab returned to Jerusalem unto the rex.</p>
<p>23 Now Joab was over all the exercitus of Israel: and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites:</p>
<p>24 And Adoram was over the tribute: and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder:</p>
<p>25 And Sheva was scriba: and Zadok and Abiathar were sacerdotes:</p>
<p>26 And Ira also the Jairite was a chief ruler about David.</p>
