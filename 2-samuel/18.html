                    <p>And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a beautiful soror, whose nomen was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.</p>
<p>And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his soror Tamar; for she was a virgo, and Amnon thought it difficile for him to do any thing to her.</p>
<p>But Amnon had a friend, whose nomen was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's frater: and Jonadab was a very prudent man.</p>
<p>And he said unto him, Why art thou, being the filius of the rex, so macer every dies? Wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto him, I love Tamar, my soror.</p>
<p>And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy lectus, and make thyself sick: and when thy pater cometh to visit thee, say unto him, I pray thee, let my soror Tamar come, and give me cibus, and let her prepare the cibus in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it at her manus.</p>
<p>So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the rex was come to visit him, Amnon said unto the rex, I pray thee, let Tamar my soror come, and make me a couple of panis, that I may eat at her manus.</p>
<p>Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy frater Amnon's domus, and make him some cibus.</p>
<p>So Tamar went to her frater Amnon's domus; and he was acumbens. And she took farinam, and kneaded it, and made panis in his sight, and did bake the panis.</p>
<p>And she took a patina, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they went out every man from him.</p>
<p>And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the cibus into the cubiculum, that I may eat of thine manus. And Tamar took the panis which she had made, and brought them into the cubiculum to Amnon her frater.</p>
<p>And when she had brought them unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my soror.</p>
<p>And she answered him, Nay, my frater, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not this folly.</p>
<p>And I, whither shall I cause my ignominia to go? and as for thee, thou shalt be as one of the imprudentes in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the rex; for he will not withhold me from thee.</p>
<p>Howbeit he would not hearken unto her vox: but, being stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her.</p>
<p>Then Amnon hated her with exceeding great odio, so that the odio wherewith he hated her was greater than the amor wherewith he had loved her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.</p>
<p>And she said unto him, There is no causa: this evil in sending me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me. But he would not hearken unto her.</p>
<p>Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said, Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the ostium after her.</p>
<p>And she had a vestita of divers colores upon her: for with such vestes were the filiae of the rex that were virgins apparelled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the ostium after her.</p>
<p>And Tamar put ashes on her caput, and rent her vestita of divers colores that was on her, and lay her manus on her caput, and went on crying.</p>
<p>And Absalom her frater said unto her, Hath Amnon thy frater been with thee? but hold now thy peace, my soror: he is thy frater; regard not this thing. So Tamar remained, and was desolata in her frater Absalom's domus.</p>
<p>But when rex David heard of all these things, he was very angry.</p>
<p>And Absalom spake unto his frater Amnon neither good nor evil: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his soror Tamar.</p>
<p>And it came to pass after two anni, that Absalom had shearers in Baal-hazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the filii of the rex.</p>
<p>And Absalom came to the rex, and said, Behold now, thy servant hath shearers; let the rex, I beseech thee, and his servants go with thy servant.</p>
<p>And the rex said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now go, lest we be chargeable unto thee. And he pressed him: howbeit he would not go, but blessed him.</p>
<p>Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my frater Amnon go with us. And the rex said unto him, Why should he go with thee?</p>
<p>But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the filii of the rex go with him.</p>
<p>Now the rex's words were as follows, As the rex hath said, so will we do.</p>
<p>So Absalom made a feast like the feast of the rex, and Absalom invited all the filii of the rex.</p>
<p>And Absalom came to Amnon, and said, Come, let us go to the vineyard of thy servant. And the filii of the rex went with him.</p>
<p>And it was so, that when they were in the via, Absalom commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when Amnon's cor is merry with vino, and when I say unto you, Smite Amnon; then kill him, fear not: have not I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.</p>
<p>And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the filii of the rex arose, and every man gat him up upon his mula, and fled.</p>
<p>And it came to pass, while they were in the via, that tidings came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the filii of the rex, and there is not one of them left.</p>
<p>Then the rex arose, and tare his vestes, and lay on the terra; and all his servants stood by with their vestes rent.</p>
<p>And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's frater, answered and said, Let not my dominus suppose that they have slain all the young men the filii of the rex; for Amnon only is dead: for by the mandatum of Absalom this hath been determined from the dies that he forced his soror Tamar.</p>
<p>Now therefore let not my dominus the rex take the thing to his cor, to think that all the filii of the rex are dead: for Amnon only is dead.</p>
<p>But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his oculi, and looked, and behold, there came much people by the via of the collis side, behind him.</p>
<p>And Jonadab said unto the rex, Behold, the filii of the rex come: as thy servant said, so it is.</p>
<p>And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that behold, the filii of the rex came, and lifted up their voces and wept: and the rex also and all his servants wept very sore.</p>
<p>But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, rex of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every dies.</p>
<p>Now Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three anni.</p>
<p>And the soul of rex David longed to go forth unto Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.</p>
