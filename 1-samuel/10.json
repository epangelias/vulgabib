  "Then Samuel took a vial of oleum and poured it upon his caput, and kissed him, and said, Is it not because the Dominus hath unctus thee for a dux over his hereditas Israel?",
  "And Samuel said unto Saul, The Dominus hath sent me to unctus thee for a dux over his populus Israel: now therefore hearken thou unto the vox of the Dominus.",
  "Thus saith the Dominus of the exercitus, I remember that which Amalech did to Israel, how he laqueos in his via, when he came up from Egypt.",
  "Now go and smite Amalech, and utterly destroy all that he hath, and spare him not; but slay both man and mulier, infant and lactens, bovem and asinum, camelus and ovem.",
  "And Saul gathered the populus together, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand pedes, and ten thousand viri of Judah.",
  "And Saul came to a civitas of Amalech, and laid in wait in the valles.",
  "And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalechites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye shewed clementia to all the filii Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalechites.",
  "And Saul smote the Amalechites from Havilah until thou comest to Shur, that is over against Egypt.",
  "And he took Agag rex of the Amalechites alive, and utterly destroyed all the populus with the edge of the gladius.",
  "But Saul and the populus spared Agag, and the best of the pecora, and of the greges, and of the boves, and of the vituli, and of the lanium, and all that was bonus, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.",
  "Then came the vox of the Dominus unto Samuel, saying,",
  "It repenteth me that I have made Saul rex: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my mandata. And it displeased Samuel; and he cried unto the Dominus all night.",
  "And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the matutine, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a monument, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.",
  "And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Benedictus tu in nomine Domini; I have performed the mandata of the Dominus.",
  "And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of pecora in mine aures, and the lowing of boves which I hear?",
  "And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalechites: for the populus spared the best of the pecora and of the greges to sacrifice unto the Dominus thy Deus; and the residue we have utterly destroyed.",
  "Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the Dominus hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on.",
  "And Samuel said, When thou wast pusillus in thine own sight, wast thou not made the caput of the tribus of Israel, and the Dominus anointed thee rex over Israel?",
  "And the Dominus sent thee on a via, and said, Go and utterly destroy the peccatores, the Amalechites, and fight against them until they be consumed.",
  "Wherefore then didst thou not obey the vox of the Dominus, but didst fly upon the praeda, and didst evil in the sight of the Dominus?",
  "And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the vox of the Dominus, and have gone the via which the Dominus sent me, and have brought Agag rex of Amalech, and have utterly destroyed the Amalechites.",
  "But the populus took of the praeda, pecora and greges, the best of those which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the Dominus thy Deus in Gilgal.",
  "And Samuel said, Hath the Dominus as great delectare in holocausta and victimas, as in that the vox of the Dominus should be obeyed? Behold, to obey is better than sacrificium, and to hearken than the adipem of arieti.",
  "For rebellion is as the peccatum of ariolus, and stubbornness is as iniquitas and idolatria. Because thou hast rejected the vox of the Dominus, he hath also rejected thee from being rex.",
  "And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the mandata of the Dominus, and thy words: because I feared the populus, and obeyed their vox.",
  "Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my peccatum, and turn again with me, that I may worship the Dominus.",
  "And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou hast rejected the vox of the Dominus, and the Dominus hath rejected thee from being rex over Israel.",
  "And Samuel turned about to go away, but Saul laid hold upon the hem of his vestis, and it rent.",
  "And Samuel said unto him, The Dominus hath rent the regnum of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a proximus of thine, who is better than thou.",
  "And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not homo, that he should repent.",
  "Then he said, I have sinned: yet honour me now, I pray thee, before the anciani of my populus, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship the Dominus thy Deus.",
  "So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the Dominus.",
  "Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag rex of the Amalechites. And Agag came unto him delicatus. And Agag said, Surely the amaritudo of death is past.",
  "And Samuel said, As thy gladius hath made mulieres childless, so shall thy mater be childless among mulieres. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the Dominus in Gilgal.",
  "Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his domus to Gabaa of Saul.",
  "And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the dies of his mortis: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: because the Dominus had repented that he had made Saul rex over Israel."
