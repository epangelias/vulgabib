  "By night on my bed I sought him whom my animus loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.",
  "I will rise now, and go about the civitas, in the streets, and in the broad ways I will seek him whom my animus loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.",
  "The vigiles that go about the civitas found me: to whom I said, Saw ye him whom my animus loveth?",
  "It was but a little that I passed from them, but I found him whom my animus loveth: I held him, and would not let him go, until I had brought him into my mater's domus, and into the chamber of her who conceived me.",
  "I charge you, O filiae of Jerusalem, by the capri, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my amor, until he please.",
  "Who is this that cometh out of the desert like a column of fumus, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all powders of the perfumer?",
  "Behold his lectica, threescore valientes are about it, of the valientes of Israel.",
  "They all hold gladii, being experti in war: every man hath his gladius upon his thigh because of fear in the nocte.",
  "King Solomon made himself a currus of the lignum of Lebanon.",
  "He made the columnae thereof of silver, the supporta of gold, the seat of purple, the middle paved with love for the filiae of Jerusalem.",
  "Go forth, O filiae of Zion, and behold king Solomon with the corona wherewith his mater crowned him in the die of his desponsation, and in the die of the gladness of his cor."
