                    <p>1. Then Job answered and said, Hear, I beseech you, my vocatio, and attend to the disputatio of my lips.</p>
<p>2. For I am full of sermones, and the Spirit of me forces me to speak.</p>
<p>3. I will speak, that I may find a consolatio for my animus: and my os shall show the sinceritas of my mouth.</p>
<p>4. For I know not to speak thus, that I am a pecunia, that the libertas of my dictum I should suppress.</p>
<p>5. For who is this that hideth the veritas, and speaketh not in the fidelitas of his cor?</p>
<p>6. Hear now my sermones, and attend to the disputatio of my labia.</p>
<p>7. O see that I have in my manus the Spirit of Deum, and that the inspiratio of the Omnipotens hath not given me the sapientia.</p>
<p>8. Yea, the longaevus are not now in the terra, and the sapientes are not now in the days of antiquus.</p>
<p>9. Dicimus enim sapientia, and from antiquus we have the scientia.</p>
<p>10. But there is a Spirit in homo, and the inspiratio of the Omnipotens him giveth the intellectus.</p>
<p>11. For the grandaevus, not always have the sapientia, neque semper seniores intellegunt iudicium.</p>
<p>12. Behold, I have seen the sapientia, and she is not in the terra: for the largitas of Deum is above the terra.</p>
<p>13. With him is fortitudo and sapientia: the ipse is Counsellor and potens.</p>
<p>14. Whatsoever he destroyeth, it shall not be built: and whomsoever he shutteth up, shall not be opened.</p>
<p>15. Behold, he withholdeth the aquas, and they dry up: also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the terra.</p>
<p>16. With him is fortitudo and sapientia: the ipse is Counsellor and potens.</p>
<p>17. He leadeth the principes away spoiled, and the iudices of the terra he maketh fooles.</p>
<p>18. He looseth the ligamina of reges, and girdeth their lumbos with a cingulum.</p>
<p>19. He leadeth away the sacerdotes, and overthroweth the potentes.</p>
<p>20. He removeth the fides of the loquentes, and taketh away the intellectus of the seniores.</p>
<p>21. He poureth contemptus upon the principes, and weakeneth the fortitudo of the potentes.</p>
<p>22. He discovereth the profunda of the tenebrae, and bringeth out to the lumen the umbram.</p>
<p>23. He multiplieth the gentes, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth the gentes, and disperseth them.</p>
<p>24. He taketh away the intellectus of the principes of the terra, and maketh them err in a desertum without a via.</p>
<p>25. They grope in the tenebrae without the lumen, and he maketh them to stagger like a homo ebrius.</p>
