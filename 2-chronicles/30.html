                    <p>Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the domus of the Lord at Jerusalem, to keep the phase of the pascha unto the Lord God of Israel.</p>
<p>For the king had taken counsel, and his principes, and all the congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the phase the secundus time.</p>
<p>For they could not keep it at that tempus, because the sacerdotes had not sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>And the thing pleased the king and the whole congregation.</p>
<p>So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the phase of the pascha unto the Lord God of Israel at Jerusalem: for they had not done it of a long time, as it was written.</p>
<p>So the couriers went with the letters from the king and his principes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, Ye filii of Israel, turn again unto the Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he will return to the reliquiae of you, that are escaped out of the manu of the reges of Assyria.</p>
<p>And be not like your patres, and your fratres, which trespassed against the Lord God of their patres, who therefore gave them up to desolation, as ye see.</p>
<p>Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your patres were, but yield yourselves unto the Lord, and enter into his sanctuarium, which he hath sanctified for ever: and serve the Lord your God, that the fierceness of his ira may turn away from you.</p>
<p>For if ye turn again unto the Lord, your fratres and your filii shall find clementiam before them that lead them captive, so that they shall return to this terra: for the Lord your God is clemens and misericors, and will not turn away his facies from you, if ye return unto him.</p>
<p>So the couriers passed from city to city through the terra of Ephraim and Manasseh even unto Zebulun: but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them.</p>
<p>Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Also in Judah the manus of God was to give them one cor, to do the commandment of the king and of the principes, by the domini verbum.</p>
<p>And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the festum of the azymes in the secundus mensem:</p>
<p>A very great congregation.</p>
<p>And they arose and took away the altaria that were in Jerusalem, and all the altaria for the incensum took they away, and cast them into the torrent Cedron.</p>
<p>Then they killed the pascha on the quartus decimus day of the secundus mensem: and the sacerdotes and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought in the holocausta to the domus of the Lord.</p>
<p>And they stood in their loco after their consuetudo, according to the lex of Moses the servus of the Lord: the sacerdotes sprinkled the sanguinem, which they received of the manu of the Levites.</p>
<p>For there were many in the congregation that were not mundi, because they could not sanctify themselves: but the Levites were more propinqui to sanctify the people, than the sacerdotes.</p>
<p>And there were many that were immundi among the congregation, that could not keep the phase of the pascha to the Lord in Jerusalem, because they were not mundi: wherefore Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, The good Lord pardon every cor:</p>
<p>That prepareth himself to quaerere the Lord God of his patres, though he be not mundus according to the purificationes of the sanctuarium.</p>
<p>And the Lord hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.</p>
<p>And the filii of Israel, that were present at Jerusalem, kept the festum of the azymes septem diebus with great gladness: and the Levites and the sacerdotes praised the Lord day by day, singing with loud instruments unto the Lord.</p>
<p>And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that taught the people good knowledge, and they did eat throughout the festum septem diebus, offering pacificas and confessing to the Lord God of their patres.</p>
<p>And the whole congregation took counsel to keep other septem dies: and they kept other septem dies with gladness.</p>
<p>For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a thousand young bouves, and septem thousand sheep; and the principes gave to the congregation a thousand young bouves, and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of sacerdotes sanctified themselves.</p>
<p>And all the congregation of Judah, with the sacerdotes and the Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the peregrini that came out of the terra of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.</p>
<p>So there was great gladness in Jerusalem: for since the tempus of Solomon the filius of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Now the Levites and the sacerdotes arose and blessed the people: and their vox was heard, and their oratio came up to his sanctuarium in caelum.</p>
