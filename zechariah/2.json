  "I lifted up mine oculi, and saw, and behold a vir with a measuring line in his manus.",
  "Then said I, Whither goest tu? And he said unto me, To measure Hierusalem, to see quae sit latitudo eius, and quae sit longitudo eius.",
  "And behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him,",
  "And said unto him, Run, speak to this juvenile, saying, Hierusalem shall be inhabited as towns sine murus, for the multitude of homines and animalia that shall be therein.",
  "For I, saith Dominus, will be unto her a murus ignis round about, and will be the gloria in the midst of her.",
  "Ho, ho, come forth, and flee from the terra of the aquilon, saith Dominus: for I have dispersed you into the quattuor venti of caelum, saith Dominus.",
  "O Sion, escape, thou that dwellest with the filia of Babylon.",
  "For thus saith Dominus of the exercitus, After the gloria hath he sent me unto the gentes which spoiled you: for he that toucheth you toucheth the pupilla of his oculus.",
  "For behold, I will shake mine manus upon them, and they shall be a spoil to their servientes: and ye shall know that Dominus of the exercitus hath sent me.",
  "Sing and rejoice, O filia of Sion: for lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith Dominus.",
  "And many gentes shall be joined to Dominus in that die, and shall be my populus: and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and thou shalt know that Dominus of the exercitus hath sent me unto thee.",
  "And Dominus shall inherit Iudam his part in the terra sancta, and shall choose Hierusalem again.",
  "Be silent, O omnis caro, before Dominus: for he is raised up out of his sanctuarium."
