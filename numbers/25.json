  "And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit whoredom with the filiae of Moab.",
  "And they called the populus to the sacrifices of their dei, and the populus did eat, and they bowed down to their dei.",
  "So Israel joined himself unto Baalpeor: and the ire of the Lord was kindled against Israel.",
  "And the Lord said unto Moses, Take all the principes of the populus, and hang them up before the Lord against the sol, that the fierce ire of the Lord may be turned away from Israel.",
  "And Moses said unto the iudices of Israel, Slay ye every one his homines that were joined unto Baalpeor.",
  "And, behold, one of the filii of Israel came and brought unto his fratres a Madianitish mulier in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the filii of Israel, who were weeping before the door of the tabernaculum.",
  "And when Phinehas, the filius of Eleazar, the filius of Aaron the pontifex, saw it, he rose up from among the congregation, and took a lance in his manus.",
  "And he went after the homo of Israel into the pavilion, and thrust both of them through, the homo of Israel, and the mulier through her ventrem.",
  "So the plague was stayed from the filii of Israel.",
  "And those that died in the plague were twenty and four milia.",
  "And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,",
  "Phinehas, the filius of Eleazar, the filius of Aaron the pontifex, hath turned my ire away from the filii of Israel, while he was zealous for my honor among them, that I consumed not the filii of Israel in my zelus.",
  "Wherefore say, Behold, I give unto him my foedus of pacem:",
  "And he shall have it, and his semen after him, even the foedus of the sacerdotium sempiternum; because he was zealous for his Deus, and made propitiation for the filii of Israel.",
  "Now the name of the Israelite that was slain, even that was slain with the Madianitish mulier, was Zimri, the filius of Salu, a prince of a domus of the patres in the tribe of Simeon.",
  "And the name of the Madianitish mulier that was slain was Cozbi, the filia of Zur; he was head over a populus, and of a domus of patres in Madian.",
  "And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,",
  "Vex the Madianites, and smite them:",
  "For they vex you with their wiles, wherewith they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the filia of a prince of Madian, their soror, which was slain in the day of the plague for Peor's sake."
