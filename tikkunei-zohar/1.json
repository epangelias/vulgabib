  "Tikkun, in principio, God creavit the heavens and the earth.",
  "And the earth erat without form, and void; and tenebrae was upon the faciem of the deep. And the Spirit of God movebatur upon the faciem of the waters.",
  "And God dixit, Let there be lux: and there was lux.",
  "And God vidit the lux, that it erat bonum: and God divisit the lux from the tenebrae.",
  "And God appellavit the lux, Dies: and the tenebrae, he appelavit Nox. And there was vespere, and there was mane, dies unus."
