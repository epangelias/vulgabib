                    <p>There is therefore now no damnatio to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the carne, but after the Spirit.</p>
<p>For the law of the Spirit of vita hath made me free from the law of peccatum and mortis.</p>
<p>For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the carne, God sending his own Filium in the likeness of peccati carne, and for peccatum, condemned peccatum in the carne:</p>
<p>That the iustitia of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the carne, but after the Spirit.</p>
<p>For they that are after the carne do mind the things of the carne; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.</p>
<p>For to be carnally minded is mors; but to be spiritually minded is vita and pax.</p>
<p>Because the carnal mind is inimicitia against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.</p>
<p>So then they that are in the carne cannot please God.</p>
<p>But ye are not in the carne, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.</p>
<p>And if Christ be in you, the corpus is mortis because of peccatum; but the Spirit is vita because of iustitia.</p>
<p>But if the Spirit of him that raised Jesus from the mortis dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the mortis shall also quicken your corpora mortalia by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.</p>
<p>Therefore, brethren, we are debitori, not to the carne, to live after the carne.</p>
<p>For if ye live after the carne, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the corpus, ye shall live.</p>
<p>For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the filii of God.</p>
<p>For ye have not received the spirit of servitudo again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoptio, whereby we cry, Abba, Pater.</p>
<p>The Spirit himself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the filii of God:</p>
<p>And if filii, then heredes; heredes of God, and coheredes with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorificati together.</p>
<p>For I reckon that the sufferings of this praesens tempus are not worthy to be compared with the gloria that shall be revealed in us.</p>
<p>For the anxious expectation of the creatura waiteth for the revelation of the filii of God.</p>
<p>For the creatura was made subject to vanitatem, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope,</p>
<p>Because the creatura itself also shall be delivered from the servitudo of corruption into the libertas of the gloria of the filii of God.</p>
<p>For we know that the whole creatura groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.</p>
<p>And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the primicias of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our corpus.</p>
<p>For we are saved by spes: but spes that is seen is not spes: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?</p>
<p>But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patientia wait for it.</p>
<p>Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmitas: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit himself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.</p>
<p>And he that searcheth the corda knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the sancti according to the voluntas of God.</p>
<p>And we know that all things work together for bonum to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his propositum.</p>
<p>For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the imago of his Filium, that he might be the primogenitus among many fratres:</p>
<p>Moreover whom he predestinated, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also iustificavit: and whom he iustificavit, them he also glorificavit.</p>
<p>What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?</p>
<p>He that spared not his own Filium, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?</p>
<p>Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that iustificavit:</p>
<p>Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the dexter of God, who also maketh intercession for us.</p>
<p>Who shall separate us from the caritas of Christ? shall tribulatio, or distress, or persecutio, or fames, or nuditas, or periculum, or gladius?</p>
<p>As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as oves for the slaughter.</p>
<p>Nay, in all these things we are more than vincimus through him that loved us.</p>
<p>For I am persuaded, that neither mors, nor vita, nor angeli, nor principatus, nor potestas, nor presentia, nor futura,</p>
<p>Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creatura, shall be able to separate us from the caritas of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Dominus.</p>
