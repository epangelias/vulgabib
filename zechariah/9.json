  "Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Sion; proclaim, O daughter of Ierusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he is iustus, and having salus, lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass.",
  "And it shall be, when thou shalt hear the voice of thy dominus, O Ierusalem, that thou shalt say to the city of Ierusalem, Fear not, O Sion: let not thy manus be faint.",
  "Lo, thy King cometh unto thee, and he shall speak pacem unto the gentes: and his dominion shall be from mare to mare, and from flumen even to the ends of the terra.",
  "Yea, he shall be quietus, and he shall exalt the arcana of Iacob from the mouth of the gentes: for the lingua of the gentes shall be silentus, and they shall not be heard any more.",
  "Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Sion; shout, O daughter of Ierusalem: behold, thy King cometh in tuis, and he is iustus, and having salus.",
  "And he shall speak pacem unto the gentes: and his dominion shall be from mare to mare, and from flumen even to the ends of the terra.",
  "As for thee also, by the sanguis of thy foedus I have sent forth thy vincti out of the lacus in which is no aqua.",
  "Turn you to the munimenta, O ye inhabitantes of the munimenta: this day hath the Dominus declaratus, and hath formed it in the domus eius.",
  "Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Sion: for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the Dominus.",
  "And many gentes shall be coniuncti unto the Dominus in that day, and shall be my populus: and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and thou shalt know that the Dominus of the exercitus hath sent me unto thee.",
  "And the Dominius shall inherit Iudam his part in the terra sancta, and shall choose Ierusalem again.",
  "Be silent, O omnis caro, before the faciem of the Dominius: for he is excitatus out of his locum sanctus.",
  "And the propheta, when the populus shouted, and the exercitus drew near to Ierusalem, saith, I will sing for thee, O vineyard of redemptio.",
  "I will take away his chariot from Ephraim, and the equus from Ierusalem, and the arcus of war shall be cut off: and he shall speak pacem unto the gentes, and his dominion shall be from mare to mare.",
  "And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the equus from Ierusalem, and the bellum shall be cut off: and he shall speak pacem unto the gentes.",
  "And it shall be, as though the exercitus of the altare should devour the gentes, and the vineyard of redemptio should be as the populus of the terra.",
  "And I will strengthen the domus of Iudam, and I will salus the domus of Ioseph, and I will bring them again to locum, because I have amare on them: and they shall be as though I had not reiectus them: for I am the Dominius Deus tuus, and I will exaudire them.",
  "And they of Ephraim shall be like a fortis, and their cor shall be glad as in vino: yea, their filii shall see it, and be glad; their cor shall rejoyce in the Dominius.",
  "I will hisse for them, and gather them; for I have redemptus them: and they shall increase as they had increased before.",
  "And I will plant them upon their terram, and they shall no more be evellere: saith the Dominius Deus tuus."
