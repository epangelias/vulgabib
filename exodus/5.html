                    <p>1. And afterwards Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith Dominus, Rex of Israel, Let my populus go, that they may hold a festum unto me in desertum.</p>
<p>2. And Pharaoh said, Quis est Dominus, ut obediam ei, and send Israel away? I know not Dominus, neither will I let Israel go.</p>
<p>3. And they said, Deus of the Hebraei hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, tria dies journey into desertum, and sacrifice unto Deus our Deus; lest he fall upon us with pestis, or gladius.</p>
<p>4. And the rex of Aegyptus said unto them, Quare do you, Moses and Aaron, dissolere populum ab operibus suis? get you to your onera.</p>
<p>5. And Pharaoh said, Behold, the populus of the terra is now much, and ye make them cease from their onera.</p>
<p>6. And Pharaoh commanded the same die, saying, 7. Ye shall no more give the populus straw to make lateres, as heretofore: let them go and colligere straw for themselves.</p>
<p>7. And the quantitas of lateres, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be ignavi, therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrificare unto Deus our Deus.</p>
<p>8. Let them labour more, and load them with onera, that they may occupare therein, and not regard vana verba.</p>
<p>9. And the ministri populi, and the praepositi, spoke unto the populus, saying, Pharaoh commandeth, saying, Give them not straw.</p>
<p>10. Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not aught of your onera shall be diminished.</p>
<p>11. So the populus were dispersi throughout omnis terra Aegypti, colligere straw for straw.</p>
<p>12. And the praepositi urgebant eos, saying, Completere your onera, as beforetime, when ye had straw.</p>
<p>13. And the ministri populi, and the praepositi, did beat them, saying, Why have ye not completere your onera, as heretofore, and yesterday, and the die before?</p>
<p>14. And the praepositi of the filii Israel came and clamabant unto Pharaoh, saying, Why dealest thou thus with thy servos?</p>
<p>15. There is no straw given unto thy servos, and they say to us, Make lateres: and behold, thy servos are beaten; but the culpa is in thy populus.</p>
<p>16. He said, Ye are ignavi, therefore ye say, Let us go and sacrificare unto Deus.</p>
<p>17. Go therefore now, and operamini; for there shall no straw be given you, yet ye shall deliver the tale of lateres.</p>
<p>18. And the praepositi of the filii Israel did see, that they were in afflictio, and they said, Deus videat vos, and judicet: for ye have made our odium apud Pharaoh, and apud his servos, and put a gladius in eorum manibus to kill nos.</p>
<p>19. And Moses returned unto Deus, and said, Domine, cur affligis populum istum? and why hast thou sent me?</p>
<p>20. For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy nomine, he hath afflictus populum istum; neque autem liberasti populum tuum.</p>
<p>21. And Deus said unto Moses, Nunc videbis, quae faciam Pharaoni: per manum enim fortissimam, et brachium extentum, eiciciam eum, et populum suum ex terra sua.</p>
