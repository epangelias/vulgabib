  "God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judicat among the gods. How long will ye judicare unjustly, and accept the personas of the wicked?",
  "Defendite the poor and fatherless: do justitia to the afflicted and needy.",
  "Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the manus of the wicked.",
  "They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in tenebrae: all the foundations of the terra are moved.",
  "I have said, Ye are dii; and all of you are filii of the Most High.",
  "But ye shall die like mortales, and fall like unus of the principes.",
  "Arise, O Deus, judicate the terra: for thou shalt haereditas among all nations."
