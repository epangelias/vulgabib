                    <p>1 The word of the Dominus which came unto Zephaniah the son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hizkiah, in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah.</p>
<p>2 I will utterly consume all things from off the face of the terra, saith the Dominus.</p>
<p>3 I will consume the avis of the heaven, and the piscis of the sea, and the ruins that offend, and I will cut off the hominem from off the face of the terra, saith the Dominus.</p>
<p>4 I will also stretch out mine hand upon Judah, and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this locus, the names of the Chemarim with the sacerdotes;</p>
<p>5 And them that worship the exercitus of the caelum upon the roofs, and them that worship, swearing by the Dominus, and swearing by Malcham;</p>
<p>6 And them that are turned back from the Dominus; and those that have not sought the Dominus, nor inquired for him.</p>
<p>7 Hold thy peace at the presence of the Dominus Deus: for the dies irae of the Dominus is at hand: for the Dominus hath prepared a sacrifice, he hath bid his guests.</p>
<p>8 And it shall come to pass in the dies of the victim, that I will visit upon the principes, and upon the filii of the king, and upon all such as are clothed with vestimenta aliena.</p>
<p>9 In the same day also will I visit upon all those that leap over the threshold, which fill their dominos' domus with violence and deceitful words.</p>
<p>10 And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Dominus, that there shall be the sound of an ululatio from the porta of the piscium, and an howling from the secunda, and a great destruction from the colles.</p>
<p>11 Howl, ye inhabitants of the vallis, for all the negotiatores are cut down; all they that bear argentum are cut off.</p>
<p>12 And it shall come to pass at that time, that I will search Jerusalem with lanternes, and punish the homines that are settled on their faecibus, which say in their cor: The Dominus will not bonum, neither will he malum.</p>
<p>13 Therefore their opes shall become a spolium, and their domus a desolatio: they shall also build domus, but not inhabit them; and they shall plant vineae, but not drink the vinum thereof.</p>
<p>14 The great dies of the Dominus is near, it is near, and hasteth greatly, even the voice of the dies of the Dominus: the fortis shall cry there bitterly.</p>
<p>15 That day is a dies of furor, a dies of tribulatio and angustia, a dies of calamitas and desolatio, a dies of tenebrae and caligo, a dies of nebula and tempestas;</p>
<p>16 A dies of sonus of bucina and ululatio against the civitates munitionis and against the arces altitudinis.</p>
<p>17 And I will distress the hominem, and he shall walk like a caecus, because they have sinned against the Dominus: and their sanguis shall be poured out as imunditia, and their carnes shall be as imunditia.</p>
<p>18 Neither their argentum nor their aurum shall be able to liberare them in the dies of the furor of the Dominus: but the whole terra shall be consumed by the ignis of his zelus: for he shall make even a finis, yea, a velociter destruction of all them that dwell in the terra.</p>
