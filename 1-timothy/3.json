  "This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.",
  "This is a true saying, If a man desire the officium of a bishop, he desireth a bonum opus.",
  "A bishop then must be blamless, as a steward of Deus, not self-willed, not soon angry, not given to vinum, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre;",
  "But a bishop then must be irreprehensibilis, as a dispensator of Deus, not self-willed, not pronto irascibilis, not deditus to vinum, no striker, not cupidus of filthy lucre;",
  "One that ruleth well his own domus, having his filii in subjection with all gravitas;",
  "(For if a man know not how to rule his own domus, how shall he take care of the Ecclesia of Deus?);",
  "A bishop must not be a neophyte, lest being lifted up with superbia he fall into the damnation of the diabolus;",
  "Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the diabolus.",
  "Likewise must the deaconi be gravitas, not double-tongued, not given to much vinum, not greedy of filthy lucre;",
  "Holding the mysterium of the fides in a pure conscience.",
  "And let these also first be proved; then let them use the officium of a deacon, being found blameless.",
  "Even so must their uxores be gravitas, not slanderers, sober, fideles in all things.",
  "Let the deaconi be the husbands of one uxor, ruling their filii and their own domus well.",
  "For they that have used the officium of a deacon well purchase to themselves a bonum gradum, and much fiduciam in the fides which is in Christum Jesum."
