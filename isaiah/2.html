                    <p>1 The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem, in diebus illis, it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord's domus shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all gentes shall flow unto it.</p>
<p>2 And many populi shall go and say, Come ye, and let us ascend to the mountain of the Lord, to the domus of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his vi√¶, and we will ambulare in his semitis: for out of Zion shall go forth the lex, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.</p>
<p>3 And he shall judicare among the gentes, and shall rebuke many populi: and they shall beat their gladii into falces, and their lanceas into rastros: populus non accipiet gladium adversus populum, neither shall they learn war anymore.</p>
<p>4 O my populus, they that dwell in terra, when he shall elevate the signum, and they shall show the vexillum upon the montes, see that ye hearken.</p>
<p>5 O domus of Jacob, come ye, and let us ambulare in the luce of the Lord.</p>
<p>6 Therefore thou hast relinquished thy populum, the domus of Jacob, because they are replenished from the Oriens, and are soothsayers like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the filiis alienorum.</p>
<p>7 Their terra also is full of argentum and aurum, neither is there finis of their thesauri; their terra is also full of equi, neither is there finis of their currus:</p>
<p>8 Their terra also is full of idola; they worship the opus of their manus, that which their fingers have made:</p>
<p>9 And the mean man boweth down, and the nobilis man humbleth himself: therefore forgive them not.</p>
<p>10 Enter into the petra, and hide thee in the pulvis, for timor of the Lord, and for the gloria of his majestas.</p>
<p>11 The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that die.</p>
<p>12 For the dies of the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is superbus and lofty, and upon every one that is elevatus; and he shall be humbled:</p>
<p>13 And upon all the cedri of Lebanon, that are exaltati and elevati, and upon all the quercus of Bashan,</p>
<p>14 And upon all the montes exaltati, and upon all the colles that are elevati,</p>
<p>15 And upon every turris exaltata, and upon every murus fortis,</p>
<p>16 And upon all the navis of Tharsis, and upon all pleasant picturas.</p>
<p>17 And the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that die.</p>
<p>18 And the idola he shall utterly abolere.</p>
<p>19 And they shall go into the fissuras of the petrae, and into the cavitates of the terra, for timor of the Lord, and for the gloria of his majestas, when he ariseth to terrere the terra.</p>
<p>20 In that die a man shall cast his idola of argentum, and his idola of aurum, which they made each one for himself to adore, into the talpas and to the vespertiliones;</p>
<p>21 To go into the fissuras of the petrae, and into the cavitates of the saxa, for timor of the Lord, and for the gloria of his majestas, when he ariseth to terrere the terra.</p>
<p>22 Cease ye from man, whose spiraculum is in his nasus: for wherein is he to be accounted of?</p>
