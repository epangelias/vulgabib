                    <p>After this opened Job his os, and cursed his diem.</p>
<p>Why died I not in utero, or why did I not expire in partu?</p>
<p>Why did I not perish at the time of partus, or why did I not expire in utero?</p>
<p>Wherefore issued I from utero, to see labor and dolor?</p>
<p>My days are swifter than a cursor, they flee away, they see not bonum.</p>
<p>They are passed away as navis, which glideth away as an aquila upon the flumen.</p>
<p>For what I feared is come upon me, and what I was sollicitus about is come unto me.</p>
<p>I was not in pace, neither had I quietus, neither was I in requies, yet terrors came upon me.</p>
<p>Then I said, My somnus is departed from me, and my oculus shall no more vide bonum.</p>
<p>The terrors of Deus are cast upon me, and my facies is troubled by his terribilitas.</p>
<p>He hath not suffered me to take respiratio, but he hath repletus me with amaritudo.</p>
<p>If I speak, I am not heard, and if I loquor, no man attendit to my voces.</p>
<p>My amici are contemptores of my consilium, and they who were in pace with me are now abiecti.</p>
<p>My servus and my ancilla are turned against me, and they who were in my domus are now mei inimici.</p>
<p>I callo, but they do not respondere, and I oro, but they do not exaudire me.</p>
<p>They have taken away my iustitia, and the Deus whom I servio hath taken away my spes.</p>
<p>My dies are consumpti, and my corda is extincta, and the Deus whom I servio hath taken away my fiducia.</p>
<p>Since his ira is kindled against me, and he counteth me as uno of his inimici.</p>
<p>His legiones are sent against me, and they have obsedit my anima.</p>
<p>They have circumsedit me, as a munitio, and they have obsedit my via.</p>
<p>He hath repletus me with amaritudo, and he hath trade me with his furor.</p>
<p>And now I shall expire, and I shall vide bonum no more.</p>
<p>Why then did I not mori in utero, or why did I not expire in partu?</p>
<p>Why did I not perish at the time of partus, or why did I not expire in utero?</p>
<p>Why issued I from utero, to see labor and dolor?</p>
