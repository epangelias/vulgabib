                    <p>O Lord God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before thee:</p>
<p>Let my prayer come before thee: incline thine auris to my clamor;</p>
<p>For my animus is full of calamitates: and my vita draweth nigh unto mortem.</p>
<p>I am counted with them that descend into lacus: I am as a homo that hath no virtus:</p>
<p>Free among the mortui, like the interfecti, that lie in sepulchre, whom thou rememberest no more: and they are cut off from thy manus.</p>
<p>Thou hast laid me in the lowest lacus, in obscuris, in profundis.</p>
<p>Thy indignatio lieth hard upon me, and thou hast increased all thy fluctus over me. Selah.</p>
<p>Thou hast put away mine amici far from me; thou hast made me an abomination unto them: I am shut up, and I cannot come forth.</p>
<p>Mine oculus mourneth by reason of affliction: Lord, I have called daily upon thee, I have stretched out my manus unto thee.</p>
<p>Shall thy mirabilia be known in the tenebris? and thy iustitia in the terra oblivionis?</p>
<p>Lord, why castest thou off my animus? why hidest thou thy faciem from me?</p>
<p>I am afflicted and ready to mortem from my iuventus up: while I suffer thy terrores, I am distracted.</p>
<p>Thy furores go over me; thy terrores have cut me off; they came round about me like aquae all the day long; they compassed me about together.</p>
<p>Lover and amicus hast thou put far from me, and mine amici into caligo.</p>
