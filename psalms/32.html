                    <p>Beatus is the man whose transgressio is forgiven, whose peccatum is covered.</p>
<p>Blessed is the homo unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquitas, and in whose spirit there is no dolus.</p>
<p>When I kept silence, my ossa waxed old through my roaring all the diem.</p>
<p>For day and night thy manus were heavy upon me: my vitalis sap is turned in the aestus of summer. Selah.</p>
<p>I acknowledged my peccata unto thee, and mine iniquitates have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressiones unto the Lord; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my peccatum. Selah.</p>
<p>For this shall every sanctus homo pray unto thee in a tempus of finding: surely in the inundatio of many aquae the flumen shall not come nigh unto him.</p>
<p>Thou art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from tribulatio: thou shalt compass me about with cantica of deliverance. Selah.</p>
<p>I will instruct thee and teach thee in the via which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine oculus.</p>
<p>Be ye not like the equus, or like the asinus, which have no intellectus: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near unto thee.</p>
<p>Many are the afflictiones of the iustus: but the Lord delivereth him out of them all.</p>
<p>He keepeth all his ossa: not one of them is fracted.</p>
<p>Malitia shall slay the impium: and they that hate the iustum shall be desolati.</p>
<p>The Lord redeemeth the anima of his servus: and none of them that trust in him shall be desolati.</p>
