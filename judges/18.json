  "In those dies, there was no rex in Israel: but in those tempora, every quis did that which seemed rectus in his own oculus.",
  "Now it came to pass, that there was a Levita who was habitare in monte Ephraim, and he took a sponsa from Beth-lehem of Juda.",
  "And his sponsa became amara with him, and she went back to the domus of her pater and mater in Beth-lehem of Juda, and there she was four dies.",
  "Then she arose with her mari to come into the terra of Judah to the domus of his amicus: and the young homo the Levita arose, that he might bring back his sponsa.",
  "And when he had cum with her to the porta of the domus of the pater of the virgine, he heard a vox from the porta of the domus of his pater-in-lawe, saying: Who goeth thither?",
  "And he answered him, and said: Peaceably; for I came to see the filia of your amicus: and he gave him poma to eat and potus to drink, and a minister to him a manducare and he began to speak.",
  "The Levita had forgotten to mentio that the amica was not placata in her corde to cum back, for that was why he did not call for her in those dies, nor even gave the dona, she could take it but then became anxios.",
  "When they saw the old man at porta with dona for Levita in hand with minister but there were voices inside to do Malum things with them."
