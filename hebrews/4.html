                    <p>Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into veritas, any of you should seem to come short of it.</p>
<p>For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our fiducia stedfast unto the end;</p>
<p>While it is said, To day if ye will hear his vox, harden not your cordia, as in the provocation.</p>
<p>For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Aegypto by Moses;</p>
<p>But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had peccatum, whose cadavera fell in the deserto?</p>
<p>And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his requiem, but to them that obeyed not?</p>
<p>So we see that they could not enter in because of incredulitas.</p>
<p>Let us labour therefore to enter into that requiem, lest any man fall after the same exemplum of incredulitas.</p>
<p>For the word of Deus is vivus, and effacax, and more cutting than any gladius, and sharper than any bipennis, piercing even to the dividing asunder of anima and spiritus, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the cogitationes and intents of the cor.</p>
<p>And there is no creatura that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are nudum and open unto the oculi of him with whom we have to do.</p>
<p>Seeing then that we have a great sacerdos, that is passed into the coelos, Jesus the Filius of Deus, let us hold fast our confessio.</p>
<p>For we have not an high sacerdos which cannot be compassionate to our infirmitas; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without peccatum.</p>
<p>Let us therefore come boldly unto the thronus of gratia, that we may obtain misericordia, and find gratia to help in time of necessitas.</p>
