  "For upon the primus die of the mensis he began to ascend from Babylon, and on the primus die of the quintus mensis came he to Hierusalem, according to the prosperitas of his manus super him.",

  "And this is the copia of the epistula of the rex Artaxerxes, which he gave unto Ezra sacerdos, the scriptor of the verba of the mandata of the Lord, and of the statuta of Israel.",
  "Artaxerxes rex, rex of reges, unto Ezra sacerdos, the perfectus scriptor of the lex of the Deus of caelum, salus.",
  "I have made a decretum, that all they of the populus of Israel, and of his sacerdotes and Levites, in my regnum, which are voluntarii to go up to Hierusalem, shall go with thee.",
  "Forasmuch as thou art sent of the rex, and of his septem consiliarii, to investigare Juda and Hierusalem, according to the lex of thy Deus which is in thy manus;",

  "And whatsoever more shall be necessarium for the domus of thy Deus, which thou shalt have occasio to bestow, bestow it out of the regis thesaurus.",
  "And I, even I Artaxerxes the rex, have made a decretum to all the thesaurarii, which are beyond the flumen, that whatsoever Ezra sacerdos, the scriptor of the lex of the Deus of caelum, shall require of you, it be done speedily;",
  "Unto an hundred talenta of argentum, and an hundred cori of wheat, and an hundred bati of vinum, and an hundred bati of oleum, and salis without mensura.",
  "Whatsoever is commanded by the Deus of caelum, let it be done speedily for the domus of the Deus of caelum: for why should there be ira against the regnum of the rex and his filii?",
  "Also we certify you, that touching any of the sacerdotes and Levites, singers, porters, Nathinim, or ministers of this domus of Deus, it shall not be lawful to impose toll, tribute, or custodia upon them.",
  "And thou, Ezra, after the sapientia of thy Deus, which is in thy manus, shalt appoint judices and magistrates, which may judicare all the populus, that are beyond the flumen, all such as know the leges of thy Deus; and teach ye them that know them not.",
  "And whosoever will not do the lex of thy Deus, and the lex of the rex, let judicium be executed speedily upon him, whether it be unto mortem, or unto exilium, or unto confiscatio of goods, or to imprisonment.",
  "Blessed be the Lord Deus of our patres, who hath put such a thing as this in the rex' cor, to beautify the domus of the Lord, which is in Hierusalem;",
  "And hath extended misericordiam unto me before the rex, and his consiliarii, and before all the rex' potentes. And I was comforted according to the manus of the Lord my Deus upon me, and I gathered together out of Israel principes to go up with me.",

  "And I gathered them together to the flumen that runneth to Ahava; and there abode we in tentoria three dies: and I viewed the populus and the sacerdotes, and found there none of the filii of Levi.",
  "Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, men of understanding.",
  "And I gave them commandement unto Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia, and I told them what they should say unto Iddo, and to his fratres the Nathinim, at the place Casiphia, that they should bring unto us ministers for the domus of our Deus.",
  "And by the bonne manus of our Deus upon us, they brought us a virum sapiens of the filii of Mahli, the filius of Levi, the filius of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his filii and fratres, eighteen;",
  "And Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the filii of Merari, his fratres and their filii, twenty;",
  "Also of the Nathinim, whom David and the principes had appointed for the ministerium of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nathinim: all of them were expressed by nomina.",
  "Then I sanctified them for the ministerium of the vasa of the domus of our Deus, even the Nathinim, and the portatores.",
  "For the filii of Israel, and for the sacerdotes, and for the Levites, I have not separated them, every one from his ministerium.",
  "Also the principes of the patres and of the sacerdotes were not separated from them, but were all in the voluntas of their fratres.",
  "The filii of Levi did bear the burden of the tabernaculum of the domus of Deus, and the sacerdotes and the portatores, and they did minister unto them, and did not separate themselves from them, by noctem and by diem.",
  "They were all purified, and the vasa were purified, and the argentum and the aurum.",
  "And I weighed unto their manus the argentum, and the aurum, and the vasa, even the oblation of the domus of our Deus, which the rex, and his consiliarii, and his principes, and all Israel, had offered.",
  "I even weighed unto their manus six hundred and fifty talents of argentum, and argentum vasa of an hundred talents, and of aurum an hundred talents;",
  "And twenty vasa of aurum, of a thousand drachmas; and two vasa of argentum of most precius metal, like to aurum.",
  "Then I said unto them, Ye are sancti unto the Lord; the vasa are sancti also; and the argentum and the aurum are voluntarium unto the Lord, of your patres.",
  "Watch ye, and keep them, until ye weigh them before the principes of the sacerdotes and the Levites, and chief of the patres of Israel, at Hierusalem, in the gazophylacium of the domus of the Lord.",
  "So took the sacerdotes and the Levites the ponderation of the argentum, and the aurum, and the vasa, to bring them to Hierusalem unto the domus of our Deus.",
  "Then we departed from the flumen of Ahava on the twelfth die of the first mensis, to go unto Hierusalem: and the manus of our Deus was super us, and he freed us from the manus of the inimicus, and of such as lay in wait by the way.",
  "And we came to Hierusalem, and abode there three dies.",
  "Now on the quartus die were the argentum and the aurum, and the vasa weighed in the domus of our Deus by the manus of Meremoth the filius of Uriah the sacerdos; and with him was Eleazar the filius of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad the filius of Jeshua, and Noadiah the filius of Binnui, Levites;",
  "By numerus and by ponderation of every thing: and all the ponderation was written at that time.",
  "Also the filii of those that had been in captivitatem, who were come out of the captivitatem, offered burnt oblations to the Deus of Israel, twelve young boves for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he goats for a sin offering: all this was a burnt offering unto the Lord.",
  "And they delivered the regis mandata unto the rex' satrapae, and to the duces of the provincia beyond the flumen: and they furthered the populus, and the domus of Deus."
