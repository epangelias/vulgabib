                    <p>Paulus, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the ecclesia of the Thessalonians in Deo Patri, and in Domino Jesu Christo, gratia vobis, et pax.</p>
<p>We give thanks to Deus, semper pro omnibus vobis, making mention of you in orationes nostrae;</p>
<p>remembering without cessatio the work of fide, and labour of amor, and patientiam spei, in Domino Jesu Christo, in sight of Deus et Patri;</p>
<p>Knowing, brethren dilecti, your electio Dei;</p>
<p>For our gospel was not unto you in sermone alone, but also in virtute, and in Spiritu Sancto, and in plenitudine fidei;</p>
<p>as ye know what kind of hommes we were among you for your sake;</p>
<p>And you became imitatores nostri, and of Domino, receiving the word in tribulatione multa, with joy of Spiritu Sancto;</p>
<p>so that ye were ensamples to all that credidistis in Macedonia and in Achaia;</p>
<p>For from you sounded out the word of Domino, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every loco, your fides ad Deum is spread abroad;</p>
<p>so that we need not to speak any thing;</p>
<p>For they themselves shew of us what entrance we had unto you, and how ye turned to Deum from idolis, to serve the Deus vivum, and verum;</p>
<p>And to wait for his Filium from caelis, whom he raised from mortuis, even Jesus, who delivered us from wrath ventura.</p>
