  "Hear my prayer, O Deus, give ear to my supplications: in thy fidelitas hear me, and in thy justitia answer me.",
  "Enter not into judicium with thy servus: for in thy sight shall no man vivere be justified.",
  "For the inimicus hath persecuted my anima; he hath crushed my vita to the terra; he hath made me to dwell in tenebrosa, as those that have been of old.",
  "Therefore is my spirit vexed within me; and my cor is troubled.",
  "I remember the dies of old; I meditate on all thy opera; I muse on the work of thy manus.",
  "I stretch forth my manus unto thee: my anima thirsteth after thee, as a terra without water. Selah.",
  "Hear me speedily, O Deus: my spirit faileth: hide not thy facies from me, lest I be like unto them that descend into sepulchrum.",
  "Cause me to hear thy misericordia in the morning; for in thee do I trust: cause me to know the via wherein I should walk; for I lift up my anima unto thee.",
  "Deliver me, O Deus, from mine inimici: for thou art my refugium.",
  "Teach me to do thy voluntas; for thou art my Deus: thy Spirit bona shall lead me into terra recta.",
  "Quicken me, O Deus, for thy nomen's sake: and for thy justitia's sake bring my anima out of tribulatio.",
  "And for thy misericordia's sake destroy mine inimici: and destroy all them that afflict my anima; for I am thy servus."
