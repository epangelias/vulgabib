  "Hear this, all ye nations: give ear, all ye inhabitants of the terra,",
  "Both low and high, rich and poor, together.",
  "My mouth shall speak sapientia; and the meditation of my cor shall be understanding.",
  "I will incline mine aurem to a proverb: I will open my os in a riddle.",
  "Wherefore should I fear in dies malorum, when the iniquity of my calceus shall compass me about?",
  "They that trust in their divitiae, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;",
  "None of them can by any means redimere fratrem, nor give to Deus a ransom for him:",
  "For the redemption of their animus is pretiosus, and it faileth for ever;",
  "That he should still vivere for ever, and not see corruptio.",
  "For he seeth that sapiens and stultus die, as well as the animalia, and they all perish together, and leave their riches in the mundo.",
  "Their sepulchra are domus for ever, and their habitatio from generation to generation.",
  "They call their terra after their own nomina.",
  "And man, being in honore, hath not understood; he is compared to animalia, and is like them.",
  "This their via is folly: yet their posteritas approbat their sayings.",
  "Like sheep they are laid in sepulchra; death shall feed on them; and the recti shall have dominion over them in the mane.",
  "But Deus will redimere my animus from the manus of gehenna: for he shall suscipere me.",
  "Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the gloria of his domus is increased;",
  "For when he shall mori, he shall not take anything away with him; his gloria shall not descend with him.",
  "Though while he lived, he blessed his animus; and men will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself.",
  "He shall go to the generation of his patres; they shall never see lumen.",
  "Man that is in honore, and hath not intellectum, is compared to animalia, and is like them."
