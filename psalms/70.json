  "1 Make haste, O Deus, to deliver me; make haste to help me, O Dominus.",
  "2 Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my animus; let them be turned backward and put to confusion that desire my hurt.",
  "3 Let them be turned back for a reward of their ignominia, who say, Aha, aha.",
  "4 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee, and let such as love thy salvus say continually, Let Deus be magnified.",
  "5 But I am pauper and needy; make haste unto me, O Deus: thou art my auxilium and my liberator; O Dominus, make no delay.",
  "6 O Deus, thou hast known my stultitia, and my delicta have not been hidden from thee.",
  "7 Let not them that wait on thee, O Dominus, Dominus of virtus, be ashamed for my sake; let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O Deus of Israel.",
  "8 Because for thy sake I have borne ignominia; my facies is covered with shame.",
  "9 I am become a stranger unto my fratres, and an alien unto the filii of my mater.",
  "10 For the zelus of thy domus hath eaten me up; and the reprehensions of them that reprehend thee are fallen upon me.",
  "11 When I wept and chastened my animus with jejunium, that was turned to my ignominia.",
  "12 I put on sacculus also, and they made me a proverb.",
  "13 They that sit in porta spoke against me, and I was the cantus of them that drink vinum.",
  "14 But as for me, I will cry unto thee, O Dominus, in a time acceptable; O Deus, in the multitude of thy misericordia hear me, in the veritas of thy salvus.",
  "15 Deliver me out of the limus, that I sink not; let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the profundum of aqua.",
  "16 Let not the flumen of aqua overflow me, neither let the profundum swallow me up; and let not the puteus shut his os upon me.",
  "17 Hear me, O Dominus; for thy misericordia is bonus; according to the multitude of thy pietas hear me.",
  "18 And hide not thy facies from thy servus; for I am in tribulatio; hear me speedily.",
  "19 Draw nigh unto my animus, and redime me; save me because of mine inimici.",
  "20 Thou hast known my ignominia, and my pudor, and my ignominia; mine adversaries are all before thee.",
  "21 Reproch hath broken my cor; and I am full of heaviness; and I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none.",
  "22 They gave me gall for cibus; and in my siti they gave me vinum to drink.",
  "23 Let their mensa be made a snare unto them; and let that which should have been their pacem be a falle.",
  "24 Let their oculi be darkened, that they see not; and make their femur to shake continually.",
  "25 Pour out thy indignatio upon them, and let thy ira take hold of them.",
  "26 Let their habitatio be desolate; and let none dwell in their tabernacula.",
  "27 For they persecute him whom thou hast plagas; and they talk to the dolor of those whom thou hast vulneras.",
  "28 Add iniquitatem unto their iniquitatem; and let them not come into thy justitia.",
  "29 Let them be blotted out of the liber of the vivus; and not be written with the justi.",
  "30 I am pauper and sorrowful; let thy salvus, O Deus, set me up on high.",
  "31 I will praise the nomine of Deus with a cantus; and I will magnify him with gratiarum actione.",
  "32 This also shall please Deus better than a young unicornis, or a bullock that hath cornua and ungulas.",
  "33 The pauperi have seen it, and they are glad; and your animus that seek after Deus, be quickened.",
  "34 For Deus hath heard the pauperi; and hath not despised the captivi.",
  "35 Let the caeli and terra praise him; the mari, and all that moveth therein.",
  "36 For Deus will save Zion, and will build the civitates of Judah; that they may dwell there, and have it in possession.",
  "37 The semen also of his servos shall possess it; and they that love his nomine shall dwell therein."
