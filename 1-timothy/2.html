                    <p>I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all homines,</p>
<p>For reges, and for all that are in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable vita, in all pietas and honesty.</p>
<p>For this is good and acceptable in the sight of Deus our Salvator;</p>
<p>Who will have all homines to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of veritas.</p>
<p>For there is one Deus, and one mediator between Deus and homines, the homo Christus Jesus;</p>
<p>Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due tempus.</p>
<p>Whereunto I am ordained a praeco, and an apostolus, (I speak the veritas in Christus, and lie not;) a doctor of the Gentiles in fide and veritas.</p>
<p>I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up manus sanctas, without ira and doubting.</p>
<p>In like manner also, that the mulieres adorn themselves in modest habit, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;</p>
<p>But (which becometh womina professing pietas) with good works.</p>
<p>Let the mulieres learn in silence with all subjection.</p>
<p>But I suffer not a mulier to teach, nor to usurp authority over the vir;</p>
<p>But to be in silence.</p>
<p>For Adam was first formed, then Eva:</p>
<p>And Adam was not deceived, but the mulier being deceived was in the transgression.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in fide and charitas and sanctimonia with sobriety.</p>
