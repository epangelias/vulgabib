                    <p>Deliver me from mine enemies, O my Deus; defend me from them that rise up against me.</p>
<p>Deliver me from the workers of iniquitas, and save me from bloody homines.</p>
<p>For, lo, they lie in wait for my animus; the mighty are gathered against me; not for my transgression, nor for my peccatum, O Deus.</p>
<p>They run and prepare themselves without my culpa: awake to help me, and behold.</p>
<p>Thou therefore, O Deus, Deus meus, hastare to my auxilium.</p>
<p>Thou art the Deus of my salvation, and I have trusted in thee all the die.</p>
<p>I will sing of thy nomen: for it is bonus.</p>
<p>In the morning will I destroy all the peccatores of the terra; that I may cut off all wicked homines from the civitas of Deus.</p>
<p>Destroy, O Deus, in the consilium of the wicked; and make the cogitationes of the malignant to be in vain.</p>
<p>The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vindicta; he shall wash his pedes in the sanguis of the wicked.</p>
<p>So that a homo shall say, Truly there is a fructus for the iustus; surely there is a Deus that judicat in the terra.</p>
