  "Many a time have they afflictio me from my iuuentus, saith Israel.",
  "Many a time have they afflictio me from my iuuentus: yet they have not preuailed against me.",
  "The agri plowers plowed upon my back: they made long sulcos.",
  "But the iustus Dominus hath cut asunder the thongs of the impiorum.",
  "They shall be confounded and put to shame that delight in my calamitate: they shall be turned backe and put to shame suddenly.",
  "They shall be as grana that groweth on the tecta of the domus, which withereth afore it groweth vp:",
  "Wherewith the messor filleth not his manum, nor the binder of sheues his gremium.",
  "Neither doe they that passe by say, Benedicite in Domino, qui plantauerit, et repleuit eam.",
  "Qui in domo Dominus benedicit vos: exsurgat Israel."
