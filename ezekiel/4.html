                    <p>And thou, son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before thee, and portray upon it the city, even Jerusalem.</p>
<p>And lay siege against it, and build a fortis, and cast a munitionem about it; set the faciem thereof against it, and it shall be in obsidionem, and thou shalt obside it.</p>
<p>This shall be a signum to the domus of Israel.</p>
<p>Moreover lie thou upon thy latus sinistrum, and lay the iniquitas of the domus of Israel upon it: according to the numerus of the dies that thou shalt lie upon it thou shalt bear their iniquitas.</p>
<p>For I have laid upon thee the annos of their iniquitas, according to the numerus of the dies, three hundred and ninety dies: so thou shalt bear the iniquitas of the domus of Israel.</p>
<p>And when thou hast accomplished them, lie again on thy latus dexter, and thou shalt bear the iniquitas of the domus of Judah forty dies: I have appointed thee each day for a annum.</p>
<p>Therefore thou shalt set thy facies toward the siege of Jerusalem, and thine arm shall be uncovered, and thou shalt prophesy against it.</p>
<p>And, behold, I will lay bands upon thee, and thou shalt not turn thee from one latus to another, till thou hast ended the dies of thy siege.</p>
<p>Take thou also unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentiles, and millet, and spelt, and put them in one vas: and make thee bread thereof, according to the numerus of the dies that thou shalt lie upon thy latus, three hundred and ninety dies shalt thou eat thereof.</p>
<p>And thy pabulum which thou shalt eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a die: from time to time shalt thou eat it.</p>
<p>And thou shalt drink also water by measure, the sixth part of an hin: from time to time shalt thou drink.</p>
<p>And thou shalt eat it as barley cakes, and thou shalt bake it with dung that cometh out of man, in their sight.</p>
<p>And the Lord said, Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their panem unclean, among the gentes, whither I will drive them.</p>
<p>Then said I, Ah Lord God! behold, my soul hath not been polluted: for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten of that which dieth of itself, or is torn in pieces; neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth.</p>
<p>Then he said unto me, Lo, I have given thee cow's dung for man's dung, and thou shalt prepare thy bread therewith.</p>
<p>Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of panem in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with care; and they shall drink water by measure, and with astonishment:</p>
<p>That they may want bread and water, and be astonied one with another, and consume away for their iniquitas.</p>
