                    <p>So all Israel were reckoned by genealogia, and behold they were written in the Libri Regum Israel: the Iudaei autem were transmigrated at Hierusalem in civitate sua, from their tempus, and their nomina, principes per domos suas, and viri per familias suas.</p>
<p>The portio of the Levites autem, who were ministri in the cultus Dei, and the cantores, and the portatores, and the ianitores, and the ministri, did not separare their possessiones, quia the Levites received cibaria sua per annum, and they possessed terram, and urbem, and everything quod necessarium erat eis.</p>
<p>And the filii of Iuda, who were habitantes in Hierusalem, fuerunt these: Athaia filius Uzziae, filius Zachariae, filius Amariae, filius Saphatiae, filius Mahalaleel, of the filii of Phares, filius Iudae.</p>
<p>Et of the Silonites, Asaia the primus natu, and his filii, and Iosia, and Iedae, and Amri, and Iobabe, and Iedae, and Sama, and Sebrias, and Salum, filii of Athaia, a princeps of the domus paterna of the Silonites, qui erant principes in the domo paterna of them, and in the familia of the Silonites.</p>
<p>And the total number of the Levites in the porta of the castrum, qui were ministri in the sacra, was two hundred fourscore.</p>
<p>And the portarius, Ahiam, and his fratres, centum triginta, and Zabdiel filius mighty princeps, and in the domus paterna of his pater, viginti octo.</p>
<p>And his fratres, viginti duo, and Hasabias, and Azrihel, and Sadoc, and Adiel, and Aram, and Azael, and Hazabonari, and Sadoc, and Sediel, ministri of the Levites, were over the ministeria of the domus Domini.</p>
<p>And Ahiam, and Zabdiel, and Sadoc, and Azimoth, and Piltai, and Adaias, and Iedaias, and Maasias, and Galal, and Zadoc, and Hasabon, and Obadias, and Iosabad, and Calai, and Maasai, and Adiias, and Bani, and Beninu, the portarii, per turmas suas, qui erant over the portas of the castrum, after their fratres in Israel.</p>
<p>And Matthania filius Micha, filius Zabdi, filius Asaph, who was princeps in the initium of the sacrificia, cantavit in the gratiarum actione, cum facerent sacrificia in the solemnitatibus, and his fratres, Secundus, and Merimoth, and Abdias, and Ieduthun, and Iedaias, and Oziel, and Semaias, ministri of the Levites, in the instrumentis musicalibus of the domus Domini.</p>
<p>And his fratres, the Hebronitae, Meshelemia filius Core, and his fratres, centum eighty, who were in the porta of the castrum, ad orientalem.</p>
<p>Othni filius Mibni, qui erat princeps, and his fratres, centum triginta duo, and Zabdiel filius Gedolim, et fratres eius, viginti duo.</p>
<p>And the total number of the portarii, was centum seventy-two.</p>
<p>And David, and the principes of the exercitus, separaverunt in the ministerium of the filii of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Ieduthun, who prophetae, cum cithara, and cum psalterio, and cum cymbalis, and cum tympano, and qui cantabant, and qui faciebant, in the ministerium of the prophetae, according to the ordo of the rex.</p>
