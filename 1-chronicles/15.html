                    <p>And David made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a place for the arca foederis, and pitched for it a tabernaculum.</p>
<p>Then David said, None ought to carry the arca foederis of Deus, but the Levites: for them hath Deus chosen to carry the arca foederis of Deus, and to minister unto him for ever.</p>
<p>And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring up the arca foederis of Deus unto his locum, which he had prepared for it.</p>
<p>And David assembled the filii Aaron, and the Levites: of the filii Kohath, Uriel the prince, and his fratres, centum et viginti:</p>
<p>Of the filii Merari, Asaiah the prince, and his fratres, ducenti viginti:</p>
<p>Of the filii Gershom, Joel the prince, and his fratres, centum et triginta:</p>
<p>Of the filii Elizaphan, Shemaiah the prince, and his fratres, ducenti:</p>
<p>Of the filii Hebron, Eliel the prince, and his fratres, octoginta:</p>
<p>Of the filii Uzziel, Amminadab the prince, and his fratres, centum et duodecim.</p>
<p>And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the sacerdotes, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab:</p>
<p>And said unto them, Ye are the principes of the domus of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, both ye and your fratres, that ye may bring up the arca foederis of Deus, the Deus of Israel, unto the locum which I have prepared for it.</p>
<p>For because ye did it not at the first, Deus our Deus made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not according to the ritus.</p>
<p>So the sacerdotes and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the arca foederis of Deus of Israel.</p>
<p>And the filii of the Levites bare the arca foederis of Deus upon their umeri with vectes, as Moses commanded according to the verbum of Deus, and said unto them, Ye shall not touch the arca foederis of Deus, lest ye die.</p>
<p>And David spake to the principes of the Levites to appoint their fratres to be cantores with instrumentis musicae, psalterii, and citharis, and cymbalis, sounding, by lifting up the vox.</p>
<p>So the Levites appointed Heman filius Joel, and of his fratres, Asaph filius Berechiah; and of the filii Merari their fratres, Ethan filius Kushaiah;</p>
<p>And with them their fratres of the secunda ordinatio, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, the portarii.</p>
<p>And the cantores, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were over them with cymbalis of aes.</p>
<p>And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalterii on Alamoth;</p>
<p>And Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with citharis on the octavi, to excel.</p>
<p>And Chenaniah, prince of the Levites, was master of the cantus: for he instructed about the cantus, because he was skillful.</p>
<p>And Berechiah and Elkanah were portarii for the arca foederis.</p>
<p>And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the sacerdotes, did sound with the clariones before the arca foederis of Deus, and Obededom and Jehiah were portarii for the arca foederis.</p>
<p>Thus all Israel brought up the arca foederis of Deus with shouting, and with sound of clariones, and with citharis, and with psalterii, and with cymbalis, sounding, till they came unto the campus of David.</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when Deus helped the Levites that bare the arca foederis of Deus, that they offered septem vitulos and septem arietes.</p>
<p>And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bare the arca foederis, and the cantores, and Chenaniah the master of the cantus with the cantores: and David had upon him an ephod of linen.</p>
<p>Thus all Israel brought up the arca foederis of Deus with jubilation, and with sound of clariones, and with citharis, and with psalterii, and with cymbalis, sounding, before Deus.</p>
<p>And so it was, as they came unto the aula of David, that Michal filia Saul looking out at a fenestra saw rex David dansare and ludo, and she despised him in her cor.</p>
