                    <p>1 Thus saith the Dominus, Write thee all the verba that I have spoken unto thee in a libellus.</p>
<p>2 For behold, dies shall come, saith the Dominus, that I will bring again the captivitas of my populus Israel and Judah, saith the Dominus: and I will cause them to return to the terra that I gave to their patres, and they shall possess it.</p>
<p>3 And these are the verba that the Dominus spake concerning Israel and concerning Judah.</p>
<p>4 For thus saith the Dominus, We have heard a clamor of tremor, of timor, and non est pax.</p>
<p>5 Ask ye now, and see whether vir shall beare puer, and why do I see every manus of vir upon his lumbus, as a parturient, and all facies are turned into pallorem?</p>
<p>6 Ask, and see, whether it be dolor like unto this, which is done in the terra, because two partes thereof are cut off, and are consumed with the gladius, and the residuum is cast out into the vastitatem.</p>
<p>7 Alas, for that dies is magnus, so that non est similis to it: it is even the tempus of Jacob's tribulatio, but he shall be saved out of it.</p>
<p>8 For it shall come to pass in die illa, saith the Dominus Sabaoth, that I shall conteram the jugum from thy collum, and I shall rend thy vincula, and strangers shall no more servire thee:</p>
<p>9 But they shall servire the Dominus their Deus, and David their rex, whom I will raise up unto them.</p>
<p>10 Therefore fear thou not, O my servus Jacob, saith the Dominus, neither be thou dismayed, O Israel: for behold, I will save thee from a terra longinqua, and thy semen from terra captivitatis: and Jacob shall return, and shall be in pace, and prosperus, and none shall terrere him.</p>
<p>11 For I am with thee, saith the Dominus, to salvare thee: though I make a consummation of all gentes whither I have scattered thee, yet will I not make a consummation of thee: but I will correct thee in judicio, and will not utterly destroy thee.</p>
<p>12 For thus saith the Dominus, Thy fractura is incurabilis, and thy vulnus is grievous.</p>
<p>13 There is none to judicare thy causa, to bind up thy vulnus: thou hast remedium that shall not medicare thee.</p>
<p>14 All thy amici have forgotten thee; they do not quaerere thy salutem: for I have wounded thee with the plagis of inimicus, with the castigatio of crudelis, for the multitudo of thy iniquitates, because thy peccata are increased.</p>
<p>15 Why criest thou for dolore? thy dolor is incurabilis for the multitudo of thy iniquitates: thy peccata are increased, therefore I have done these things unto thee.</p>
<p>16 Therefore all they that devorant thee shall be devorati; and all thine adversaries, every unus of them, shall go into captivitatem; and they that spoliabunt thee shall be spoliati, and all they that praedabuntur te will I give for praedam.</p>
<p>17 For I will restore sanitas to thee, and I will heal thee of thy plagis, saith the Dominus; because they called thee an abjectio, saying, This is Sion, whom no man quaerit after her.</p>
<p>18 Thus saith the Dominus, Behold, I will bring again the captivitas of Jacob's tabernacula, and I will have misericordiam on his habitacula; and the civitas shall be built upon her mons, and the palatium shall remain in its loco.</p>
<p>19 And out of them shall proceed gratiarum actio and vox of ludentium: and I will multiplicare them, and they shall not be pauci; I will also honorare them, and they shall not be contempti.</p>
<p>20 Their filii also shall be as aforetime, and their coetus shall be established before me, and I will visitare all their oppressores.</p>
<p>21 And their princeps shall be of themselves, and their dominus shall proceed from the medio of them; and I will make him approximare, and he shall accedere unto me: for who is this that engaged his cor to accedere unto me? saith the Dominus.</p>
<p>22 And ye shall be my populus, and I will be your Deus.</p>
<p>23 Behold, the furor of the Dominus goeth forth as a tempest, and the turbo shall come down upon the caput of impius.</p>
<p>24 The ira of the Dominus shall not return, until he have executed, and until he have performed the cogitata of his cor: in the novissimo of the dies ye shall understand this.</p>
<p>24 The ira of the Dominus shall not return, until he have executed, and until he have performed the cogitata of his cor: in the novissimo of the dies ye shall understand this.</p>
