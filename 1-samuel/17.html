                    <p>Now the Philistines gathered together their exercitus in the valley of Rephaim.</p>
<p>And Saul and the exercitus of Israel were gathered together, and pitched by the valley of Elah, and set the acies against the Philistines.</p>
<p>And the Philistines stood on a montem on the one side, and Israel stood on a montem on the other side: and there was a valley between them.</p>
<p>And there went out a gigas out of the castrum of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose altitudo was six cubits and a span.</p>
<p>And he had an helmet of ferrum upon his caput, and he was armed with a lorica of scaly ferrum; and the weight of the lorica was five thousand shekels of ferrum.</p>
<p>And he had greaves of ferrum upon his legs, and a scutum of ferrum between his shoulders.</p>
<p>And the hastile of his lance was like a textrinum of a tela, and there was a spatha of six hundred shekels of ferrum in his manus; and one bearing a scutum went before him.</p>
<p>And he stood and cried unto the exercitus of Israel, and said unto them, Why are ye come out to set the acies in array? am I not a Philistinus, and ye servants to Saul? choose you a vir, and let him come down to me.</p>
<p>If he be able to pugnare with me, and to strike me, then will we be your servi: but if I prevail against him, and strike him, then shall ye be our servi, and serve us.</p>
<p>And the Philistinus said, I defy the exercitus of Israel this day; give me a vir, that we may pugnare together.</p>
<p>When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistinus, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.</p>
<p>Now David was the filius of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight filii: and the vir was old in the dies of Saul's regnum.</p>
<p>And the tres filii of Jesse went and followed Saul to the bellum: and the names of his tres filii that went to the bellum were Eliab the primus, and next unto him Abinadab, and the tertius Shammah.</p>
<p>And David was the minimus: and the tres filii of Jesse went and followed Saul.</p>
<p>But David went and returned from Saul to feed his patris sheep at Bethlehem.</p>
<p>And the Philistinus drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty dies.</p>
<p>And Jesse said unto David his filius, Take now for thy fratres an ephah of this pulmentum, and run to the castrum unto thy fratres;</p>
<p>And carry these decem panes unto the centurion, and see how thy fratres fare, and take their pledge.</p>
<p>Now Saul, and they, and all the viri of Israel, were in the valley of Elah, pugnans with the Philistines.</p>
<p>And David rose up early in the mane, and left the sheep with a custos, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the castrum, as the exercitus was going forth to the proelium, and the clangor of the exercitus was heard, and the terra trembled.</p>
<p>And David left his vasa in the manus of the custos of the vasa, and ran into the exercitus, and came and saluted his fratres.</p>
<p>And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the gigas, that Goliath nomine, out of the castrum of the Philistines, the same that spoke before: and David heard his words.</p>
<p>And all the viri of Israel, when they saw the vir, fled from him, and were sore afraid.</p>
<p>And the viri of Israel said, Have ye seen this vir that is come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that the vir who striketh him, the rex will enrich him with great divitiae, and will give him his filiam, and make his patris domus free in Israel.</p>
<p>And David spake to the viri that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the vir that striketh this Philistinus, and taketh away the opprobrium from Israel? for who is this uncircumcisus Philistinus, that he should defy the exercitus of the vivus Deus?</p>
<p>And the populus answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the vir that striketh him.</p>
<p>And Eliab his frater maior heard when he spake unto the viri; and Eliab's ira was kindled against David, and he said, Why camest thou down hither? and with whom hast thou left those pauci sheep in the deserto? I know thy audacia, and the malum of thy cor.</p>
<p>And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a causa?</p>
<p>And he turned from him toward another, and spake after the same manner: and the populus answered him again after the former manner.</p>
<p>And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed them before Saul: and he sent for him.</p>
<p>And David said to Saul, Let no vir's cor fail because of him; thy servus will go and pugnare with this Philistinus.</p>
<p>And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistinus to pugnare with him: for thou art yet a puer, and he a vir of bellum from his juvenilia.</p>
<p>And David said unto Saul, Thy servus kept his patris sheep, and there came a leo, and a ursus, and took a pecus out of the gregem:</p>
<p>And I went out after him, and struck him, and delivered it out of his os: and when he arose against me, I caught him by his barba, and struck him, and slew him.</p>
<p>Thy servus struck both the leo and the ursus: and this uncircumcisus Philistinus shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the exercitus of the vivus Deus.</p>
<p>David said moreover, The Dominus that delivered me out of the manus of the leo, and out of the manus of the ursus, he will deliver me out of the manus of this Philistinus. And Saul said unto David, Vade, and the Dominus be with thee.</p>
<p>And Saul armed David with his own armor, and he put an helmet of ferrum upon his caput; also he armed him with a coat of ferrum.</p>
<p>David girded his gladius upon his armor, and he assayed to go; for he had not proved it. And David said unto Saul, I cannot go with these; for I have not proved them. And David put them off him.</p>
<p>And he took his baculus in his manus, and chose him five lapides out of the torrente, and put them in a pera, or scrip, which he had, and his funda was in his manus: and he drew near to the Philistinus.</p>
<p>And the Philistinus came near morning and evening, and presented himself forty dies.</p>
<p>And the Philistinus was despiciens David, and saw that he was but a puer, and rubeus, and goodly to look to.</p>
<p>And the Philistinus said unto David, Am I a cane, that thou comest to me with baculi? and the Philistinus cursed David by his dii.</p>
<p>And the Philistinus said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy caro unto the aves of the caelum, and to the bestiae of the terra.</p>
<p>Then said David to the Philistinus, Thou comest to me with gladius, and lancea, and scutum, but I come to thee in nomine Domini exercituum, the Deus of the exercitus of Israel, whom thou hast defied.</p>
<p>This day will the Dominus deliver thee into mine manus; and I will strike thee, and take thy caput from thee; and I will give the cadavera of the castrum of the Philistines this day unto the aves of the caelum, and to the bestiae of the terra; that all the terra may know that there is a Deus in Israel.</p>
<p>And all this congregatio shall know that the Dominus saveth not with gladius and lancea: for the bellum is the Domini, and he will deliver you into our manus.</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when the Philistinus arose, and came, and drew near to meet David, that David hasted, and ran toward the exercitus to meet the Philistinus.</p>
<p>And David put his manus in his pera, and took thence a lapide, and slang it, and struck the Philistinus in his frontem, that the lapide sunk into his frontem; and he fell upon his facies to the terra.</p>
<p>So David prevailed over the Philistinus with a lapide, and with a funda; and struck the Philistinus, and slew him; but there was no gladius in the manus of David.</p>
<p>Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistinus, and took his gladium, and drew it out of the vagina thereof, and slew him, and cut off his caput therewith. And when the Philistines saw their gigas was dead, they fled.</p>
<p>And the viri of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou come to the valle, and to the portae of Ekron. And the Philistines fell down wounded in all the via of Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron.</p>
<p>And the filii of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they spoiled their castra.</p>
<p>And David took the caput of the Philistinus, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armor in his tabernaculum.</p>
