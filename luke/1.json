  "Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us, Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the principio were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the verbum, It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the superior, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus, That thou mightest know the certitudo of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed.",
  "There was in the dies of Herodes, the king of Judaea, a certain sacerdos named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his uxor was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.",
  "And they were both justi before God, walking in all the mandata and justifications of the Lord, without reprehension.",
  "And it came to pass, that while he executed the sacerdotium before God in the order of his course, According to the custom of the sacerdotium, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the templum of the Lord.",
  "And the whole multitude of the people were in oration outside at the hora of incense.",
  "And there appeared unto him an angelus of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.",
  "And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.",
  "But the angelus said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy oratio is heard; and thy uxor Elisabeth shall bear thee a filius, and thou shalt call his name Johannes.",
  "And thou shalt have joy and gaudium; and many shall rejoice at his nasci.",
  "For he shall be magnus in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither vinum nor sicera; and he shall be filled with the Spiritus Sanctus, even from his materis uterus:",
  "And many of the filii of Israel shall he convert to the Lord their God.",
  "And he shall go before him in the spirit and virtus of Elias, to turn the corda of the patres to the filii, and the incredulos to the prudentia of the justi, to make ready a plebs perfectum for the Lord.",
  "And Zacharias said unto the angelus, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my uxor well stricken in anni.",
  "And the angelus answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the sight of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these gaudia.",
  "And, behold, thou shalt be silent and not able to speak, until the dies that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their tempus.",
  "And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the templum.",
  "And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a visio in the templum: for he beckoned unto them and remained speechless.",
  "And it came to pass, that, as soon as the dies of his ministerium were accomplished, he departed to his own domus.",
  "And after those dies his uxor Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five menses, saying, Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the dies wherein he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men.",
  "And in the menses sixth, the angelus Gabriel was sent from God unto a civitas of Galilee, named Nazareth, To a virgo desponsata to a man whose name was Joseph, of the domus of David; and the virgo's name was Maria.",
  "And the angelus came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art gratia, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among mulieres.",
  "And when she saw him, she was troubled at his dictum, and cast in her mente what manner of salutatio this should be.",
  "And the angelus said unto her, Fear not, Maria: for thou hast found gratia with God.",
  "And, behold, thou shalt conceive in utero, and bring forth a filius, and shalt call his name Iesus.",
  "He shall be magnus, and shall be called the Filius of the Altissimus: and the Lord God shall give unto him the thronus of his pater David:",
  "And he shall reign over the domus of Jacob for ever; and of his regnum there shall be no finis.",
  "Then said Maria unto the angelus, How shall this be, seeing I know not a vir?",
  "And the angelus answered and said unto her, The Spiritus Sanctus shall come upon thee, and the virtus of the Altissimus shall overshadow thee: therefore also that Sanctus thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Filius of God.",
  "And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a filius in her senectus: and this is the sixth menses with her, who was called barren:",
  "For with God nothing shall be impossibile.",
  "And Maria said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy verbum. And the angelus departed from her.",
  "And Maria arose in those dies, and went into the montes with haste, into a civitas of Judaea;",
  "And entered into the domus of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth.",
  "And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutatio of Maria, the infans leaped in her utero; and Elisabeth was filled with the Spiritus Sanctus:",
  "And she spake out with a voce alta, and said, Blessed art thou among mulieres, and blessed is the fructus of thy utero.",
  "And whence is this to me, that the mater of my Dominus should come to me?",
  "For, lo, as soon as the vox of thy salutatio sounded in mine aures, the infans leaped in my utero for gaudium.",
  "And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a perfectio of those things which were told her from the Lord.",
  "And Maria said, My anima doth magnify the Lord, And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Salvator.",
  "For he hath regarded the humilitas of his handmaid: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.",
  "For he that is potens hath done to me great things; and sanctus is his name.",
  "And his misericordia is on them that fear him from generation to generation.",
  "He hath shewed virtus with his brachium; he hath scattered the superbi in the imagination of their corda.",
  "He hath put down the potentes from their thronus, and exalted the humiles.",
  "He hath filled the famelici with boni things; and the divites he hath sent empty away.",
  "He hath holpen his servus Israel, in remembrance of his misericordia; As he spake to our patres, to Abraham, and to his semen, for ever.",
  "And Maria abode with her about three menses, and returned to her own domus.",
  "Now Elisabeth's plenitudo of dies was come that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a filius.",
  "And her proximi and cognati heard how the Lord had shewed great misericordia upon her; and they rejoiced with her.",
  "And it came to pass, that on the octave dies they came to circumcidere the child; and they called him by the name of his pater, Zacharias.",
  "His mater answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called Johannes.",
  "And they said unto her, There is none of thy cognatio that is called by this name.",
  "And they made signs to his pater, how he would have him called.",
  "And he asked for a pugillar, and wrote, saying, His name is Johannes. And they marvelled all.",
  "And his os was opened immediately, and his lingua loosed, and he spake, praising God.",
  "And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these dicta were noised abroad throughout all the montes of Judaea.",
  "And all they that heard them laid them up in their corda, saying, What manner of child shall this be! And the manus of the Lord was with him.",
  "And his pater Zacharias was filled with the Spiritus Sanctus, and prophesied, saying, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited and redeemed his plebs,"
