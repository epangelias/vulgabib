  "1 I will sing of mercia and judgment: unto thee, O Lord, will I sing.",
  "2 I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect cor. ",
  "3 I will set no wicked thing before mine oculi: I hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me.",
  "4 A perverse animus shall depart from me: I will not know a malus man.",
  "5 Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off: him that hath an altus oculus and a proud cor, I will not suffer.",
  "6 Mine oculi shall be upon the fidus of the land, that they may dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect via, he shall minister unto me.",
  "7 He that worketh deceptio shall not dwell within my domus: he that telleth mendacium shall not tarry in my sight.",
  "8 I will early destroy all the impious of the terra, that I may cut off all wicked doers from the civitas Domini."
