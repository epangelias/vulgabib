                    <p>And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead, said unto Ahab, As Dominus liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor imber for these annos, but according to my verbum.</p>
<p>Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that is before Iordanum, and it shall be, when thou shalt drink of the brook, and I have commanded the corvi to feed thee there.</p>
<p>So he went and did according unto the verbum of Dominus: for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that is before Iordanum.</p>
<p>And the corvi brought him panem and carnes in the mane, and panem and carnes in the vespera; and he drank of the brook.</p>
<p>And it came to pass after certi dies, that the brook dried up, because there had not been imber in terra.</p>
<p>And the verbum of Dominus came unto him, saying, Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Sidon, and dwell there: behold, I have commanded a vidua there to sustain thee.</p>
<p>So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the porta of the civitas, behold, the vidua was there gathering ligna: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little aqua in a vessel, that I may drink.</p>
<p>And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsell of panis in thy manus.</p>
<p>And she said, As Dominus thy Deus liveth, I have not a cake, but a morsell of meal in a vessel, and a little oleum in a cruet: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my filius, that we may eat it, and die.</p>
<p>And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it unto me, and after make for thee and for thy filius.</p>
<p>For thus saith Dominus Deus of Israel, The vessel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruet of oleum fail, until the dies that Dominus sendeth imber upon terra.</p>
<p>And she went and did according to the verbum of Elijah: and she, and he, and her domus, did eat many dies.</p>
<p>And the vessel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruet of oleum fail, according to the verbum of Dominus, which he spake by Elijah.</p>
<p>And it came to pass after these things, that the filius of the vidua fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him.</p>
<p>And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O vir Dei? art thou come unto me to bring my peccata to memoria, and to slay my filius?</p>
<p>And Elijah said unto her, Give me thy filius. And he took him out of her manus, and carried him up into a coenaculum, where he abode, and laid him upon his own lectus.</p>
<p>And he cried unto Dominus, and said, O Dominus my Deus, hast thou also brought calamitas upon the vidua with whom I sojourn, by slaying her filius?</p>
<p>And he stretched himself upon the filius three times, and cried unto Dominus, and said, O Dominus my Deus, I pray thee, let this filius's anima come into him again.</p>
<p>And Dominus heard the vox of Elijah; and the anima of the filius came into him again, and he revived.</p>
<p>And Elijah took the filius, and brought him down out of the coenaculum into the domus, and delivered him unto his mater: and Elijah said, See, thy filius liveth.</p>
<p>And the vidua said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou art a vir Dei, and that the verbum of Dominus in thy os is veritas.</p>
