  "1. I will extol thee, O Domine, for thou hast lifted me up, and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me.",
  "2. O Domine my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me.",
  "3. O Domine, thou hast brought up my animus from Infernum: thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to Sepulcrum.",
  "4. Sing unto Domine, O ye sancti of his, and give thanks at the commemoratio of his sanctum Nomen.",
  "5. For his indignatio is but for a moment: in his favorem is vita: weeping may endure for a noctis, but iucunditas cometh in the mane.",
  "6. And in my prosperitas I said, I shall never be moved.",
  "7. Domine, by thy favorem thou hast made my montem of fortitudo to be stabile: thou didst hide thy faciem, and I was troubled.",
  "8. I cried to thee, O Domine, and unto Domine I made supplicatio.",
  "9. What proficio is there in my sanguine, when I descend into Sepulcrum? Shall the pulvis give gratias unto thee? shall it declare thy veritas?",
  "10. Hear, O Domine, and have misericordia unto me: Domine, be thou my adiutor.",
  "11. Thou hast turned for me my luctus into iucunditas: thou hast put off my sacculus, and girded me with laetitia;",
  "12. To the intent that my gloriam may sing iucunditas unto thee, and not be silent. O Domine my God, I will give gratias unto thee for ever."
