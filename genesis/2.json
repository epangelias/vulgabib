  "And the day was finis, and the seventh day God ended his opus, which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his opus, which he had made.",
  "And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his opus, which God created and made.",
  "These are the generations of the caelum and of the terra when they were created, in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens.",
  "And every plant of the field before it was in the terra, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the Lord God had not made it plue and there was not homo to till the terra.",
  "But there went up a vapor from the terra, and watered the whole face of the terra.",
  "And the Lord God formed homo of the dust of the terra, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of vita; and homo became a living anima.",
  "And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the homo whom he had formed.",
  "And out of the terra made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the lignum of vita also in the midst of the garden, and the lignum of scientia of bonum and malum.",
  "And a flumen went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four principale flumina.",
  "The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is aurum;",
  "And the aurum of that land is bonum: there is bdellium and the lapis onyx.",
  "And the name of the second flumen is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.",
  "And the name of the third flumen is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth flumen is Euphrates.",
  "And the Lord God took the homo, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.",
  "And the Lord God commanded the homo, saying, Of every lignum of the garden thou mayest freely eat:",
  "But of the lignum of scientia of bonum and malum, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.",
  "And the Lord God said, It is not bonum that the homo should be solus; I will make him an adjutor like unto himself.",
  "And out of the terra the Lord God formed every beast of the field, and every avium of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living anima, that was the name thereof.",
  "And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the avium of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an adjutor like unto himself.",
  "And the Lord God caused a sopor to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his costae, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;",
  "And the costa, which the Lord God had taken from man, made he a mulier, and brought her unto the man.",
  "And Adam said, This is now os ex ossibus meis, and caro ex carne mea: she shall be called Mulier, because she was taken out of Man.",
  "Therefore shall a man leave his pater and his mater, and shall cleave unto his mulier: and they shall be una caro.",
  "And they were both nudi, the man and his mulier, and were not ashamed."
