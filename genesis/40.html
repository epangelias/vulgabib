                    <p>And it came to pass after these veritas, that the copa, or butler, of the king of Aegyptus, and the pistor, or baker, of the king of Aegyptus, offended their dominus, the king of Aegyptus.</p>
<p>And Pharaoh was iratus with his duobus servos, and he put them in custodia in the domus of the prince of the exercitus, in the carcer, the place where Iosephus was bound.</p>
<p>And the prince of the exercitus appointed Iosephum to be with them, and he servabat them: and they were in custodia for aliquantum of dies.</p>
<p>And they dreamed a somnium, uterque per noctem, the butler and the baker of the king of Aegyptus, who were in custodia in the carcer, and each man's somnium was according to the interpretatio thereof.</p>
<p>And when Iosephus came to them in the mane, he saw that they were tristes.</p>
<p>And he asked them, saying, Quid est hoc, that your facies are so tristes to die?</p>
<p>And they said unto him, We have dreamed a somnium, and there is nemo to interpretare it. And Iosephus dixit to them, Narrate mihi your somnium, and I will interpretare it to you.</p>
<p>And the prince of the butlers narrated his somnium to Iosephum, and dixit to him, In my somnium, behold, a vine was before me;</p>
<p>And in the vine were tres sarmenta: and it was as though it budded, and her flowers bloomed, and the uvae thereof became maturae:</p>
<p>And Pharaoh's calix was in my manus: and I took the uva, and pressed it into Pharaoh's calix, and I gave the calix into Pharaoh's manus.</p>
<p>And Iosephus said unto him, This is the interpretatio thereof: The tres sarmenta are tres dies:</p>
<p>Yet within tres dies shall Pharaoh lift up thy caput, and restore thee unto thy officium: and thou shalt give Pharaoh's calix into his manus, according to the prior consuetudo, when thou wast butler.</p>
<p>But remember me, when it shall be bene with thee, and shew kindness, I beseech thee, unto me, and mention me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this domus:</p>
<p>For indeed I was stolen away out of the terra of the Hebraei: and here also have I nullo modo done, that they should put me into the carcer.</p>
<p>When the prince of the pistori saw that the interpretatio was bona, he said unto Iosephus, I also was in my somnium, and behold, I had tres canistra upon my caput:</p>
<p>And in the uppermost canistrum were omnia genera of Pharaoh's panis, and the aves ate out of the canistrum that was upon my caput.</p>
<p>And Iosephus answered, and said, This is the interpretatio thereof: The tres canistra are tres dies:</p>
<p>Yet within tres dies shall Pharaoh take away thy caput from thee, and shall suspend thee on a lignum, and the aves shall eat thy carnem.</p>
<p>And it came to pass the tertius dies, which was Pharaoh's dies natalis, that he made a convivium for all his servos: and he lifted up the caput of the prince of the butlers, and the caput of the prince of the pistori among his servos.</p>
<p>And he restored the prince of the butlers unto his officium again; and he gave the calix into Pharaoh's manus:</p>
<p>But he hanged the prince of the pistori: as Iosephus had interpreted unto them.</p>
<p>Yet did not the prince of the butlers remember Iosephum, but forgot him.</p>
