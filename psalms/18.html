                    <p>I will love thee, O Domine, my fortitudo.</p>
<p>The Domine is my rock, and my deliverer; my Deus, my trust, in whom I will put my hope; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower.</p>
<p>I will call upon the Domine, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.</p>
<p>The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of Belial made me afraid.</p>
<p>The sorrows of Sheol compassed me, and the snares of death prevented me.</p>
<p>In my distress I called upon the Domine, and cried unto my Deus: he heard my voice out of his templum, and my cry came before him, even into his aures.</p>
<p>Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the montes were moved and shaken, because he was wroth.</p>
<p>There went up a smoke out of his nasus, and fire out of his os devoured: coals were kindled by it.</p>
<p>He bowed the caelum also, and came down: and darkness was under his pedes.</p>
<p>And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the ventus.</p>
<p>He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the caelum.</p>
<p>At the brightness that was before him his clouds passed, hail stones and coals of fire.</p>
<p>The Domine also thundered in the caelum, and the Highest gave his voice; hail stones and coals of fire.</p>
<p>Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them.</p>
<p>Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the montes were discovered at thy rebuke, O Domine, at the blast of the spirit of thy indignation.</p>
<p>He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many aquae.</p>
<p>He delivered me from my potentis enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were too strong for me.</p>
<p>They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the Domine was my stay.</p>
<p>He brought me forth also into a spatium largum: he delivered me, because he delighted in me.</p>
<p>The Domine rewarded me according to my justitia; according to the puritas of my manus hath he recompensed me.</p>
<p>For I have kept the ways of the Domine, and have not wickedly departed from my Deus.</p>
<p>For all his judicia were before me, and I did not put away his statuta from me.</p>
<p>I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquitas.</p>
<p>Therefore hath the Domine recompensed me according to my justitia, according to the puritas of my manus in his sight.</p>
<p>With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;</p>
<p>With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward.</p>
<p>For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high looks.</p>
<p>For thou wilt light my candle: the Domine my Deus will enlighten my darkness.</p>
<p>For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my Deus have I leaped over a wall.</p>
<p>As for Deus, his way is perfect: the word of the Domine is tried: he is a buckler to all those that trust in him.</p>
<p>For who is Deus save the Domine? or who is a rock save our Deus?</p>
<p>It is Deus that girdeth me with fortitudo, and maketh my way perfect.</p>
<p>He maketh my feet like hinds' feet, and setteth me upon my high places.</p>
<p>He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.</p>
<p>Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great.</p>
<p>Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.</p>
<p>I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed.</p>
<p>I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet.</p>
<p>For thou hast girded me with fortitudo unto the battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.</p>
<p>Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me.</p>
<p>They cried, but there was none to save them: even unto the Domine, but he answered them not.</p>
<p>Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets.</p>
<p>Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and thou hast made me the head of the Gentiles: a people whom I have not known shall serve me.</p>
<p>As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto me.</p>
<p>The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places.</p>
<p>The Domine liveth; and blessed be my rock; and let the Deus of my salvation be exalted.</p>
<p>It is Deus that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.</p>
<p>He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.</p>
<p>Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O Domine, among the Gentiles, and sing praises unto thy Nomen.</p>
<p>Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.</p>
