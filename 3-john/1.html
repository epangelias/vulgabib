                    <p>The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in veritas.</p>
<p>Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in good sanitas, even as thy animus prospereth.</p>
<p>For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the veritas that is in thee, even as thou walkest in veritas.</p>
<p>I have no greater joya than to hear that my children walk in veritas.</p>
<p>Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers;</p>
<p>Who have borne witness of thy caritas before the ecclesia: whom thou shalt do well to send forward on their journeya after a godly sort.</p>
<p>Because that for nomen Dei they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.</p>
<p>We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers to the veritas.</p>
<p>I wrote unto the ecclesia: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the principatus among them, receiveth us not.</p>
<p>Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his opera which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out of the ecclesia.</p>
<p>Beloved, follow not that which is malum, but that which is bonum. He that doeth bonum is of Deus, but he that doeth malum hath not seen Deus.</p>
<p>Demetrius hath good witness of all men, and of the veritas itself: yea, this thou knowest, that our testimonium is vera.</p>
<p>I had many things to write unto thee, but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee:</p>
<p>Yet I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak facie to facie. Pax be to thee. Our friends salute thee. Greet the friends by nomen.</p>
