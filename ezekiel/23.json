  "The word of the Lord came again unto me, saying, filia, filiae Babyloniae, ponite cinctorium, et condescendite, et descendite in terram, ad imaginem caliginis, quia non erit ultra habitatrix in domo.",
  "Thy breasts are fashioned, and thy hair is grown, thou art in the time of thy amor, and thy pectus is erectus, but thou wast not washed, nor was thy pectus fricatum, to make it suavis.",
  "Then I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy tempus was the tempus of amores, and I spread my pallium over thee, and covered thy nuditas, and I sware unto thee, and entered into foedus with thee, saith Dominus Deus, and thou becamest mine.",
  "And I washed thee with aqua, and washed away thy sanguinem from thee, and anointed thee with oleum.",
  "I clothed thee also with bissus, and shod thee with taurus skin, and girded thee about with byssus, and covered thee with vestis pretiosa.",
  "I decked thee also with ornamentis, and put armillas in thy manus, and a torque in thy collum.",
  "And I put a gemma in thy nasus, and earrings in thy aures, and a corona of decorus in thy caput.",
  "Thus wast thou decked with auro and argento, and thy vestis was of bissus, and silk, and vestis pretiosa, thou didst eat panis similaginis, and oleum, and vinum.",
  "Then thou didst take thy pulchritudinem, and didst commit fornication with it, and didst pour out thy fornication on every viator, to whom thou didst meet.",
  "And of thy vestis thou didst take, and madest thyself high places of diversi coloris, and didst commit fornication thereupon, the like things shall not come, neither shall be so.",
  "Thou didst take also thy pretiosi smaragdi, and thy auri ornaments, which I gave thee, and madest to thyself imaginem virilis, and didst commit fornication with it,"
