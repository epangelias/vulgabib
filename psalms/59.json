  "Deliver me from mine enemies, O my Deus; defend me from them that rise up against me.",
  "Deliver me from the workers of iniquitas, and save me from bloody homines.",
  "For, lo, they lie in wait for my animus; the mighty are gathered against me; not for my transgression, nor for my peccatum, O Deus.",
  "They run and prepare themselves without my culpa: awake to help me, and behold.",
  "Thou therefore, O Deus, Deus meus, hastare to my auxilium.",
  "Thou art the Deus of my salvation, and I have trusted in thee all the die.",
  "I will sing of thy nomen: for it is bonus.",
  "In the morning will I destroy all the peccatores of the terra; that I may cut off all wicked homines from the civitas of Deus.",
  "Destroy, O Deus, in the consilium of the wicked; and make the cogitationes of the malignant to be in vain.",
  "The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vindicta; he shall wash his pedes in the sanguis of the wicked.",
  "So that a homo shall say, Truly there is a fructus for the iustus; surely there is a Deus that judicat in the terra."
