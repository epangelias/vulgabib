  "O Israel, return unto the Lord thy Deus, for thou hast fallen by thine iniquitas.",
  "Take with you verba of Teshuvah, and turn to the Lord: say unto him, Take away all iniquitas, and receive us graciously: so will we offer the sacrificia of our lips.",
  "Asshur shall not save us; we will not ride upon equus: neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, Ye are our dei: for in thee the fatherless findeth misericordia.",
  "I will heal their aversio: I will love them freely: for mine ira is turned away from him.",
  "I will be as ros to Israel: he shall flore as lilium, and he shall strike his radices as Libanus.",
  "His rami shall expand, and his honorem shall be as Libanus.",
  "They that dwell under his umbra shall revenire: they shall vivere as triticum, and flore as vinea: the odorem thereof shall be as vinum Libani.",
  "Ephraim shall say, What have I to do any more with idola? I will hear him, and I will observare him: I am quasi abies fructifera; from me is thy fructus found.",
  "Who is sapiens, and he shall intelligere these things? prudent, and he shall cognoscere them? for the viae of the Lord are rectae, and the justi shall ambulare in them: but the transgressores shall offend in eis."
