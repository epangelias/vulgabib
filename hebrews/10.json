  "By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrificium than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.",
  "By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see mortem; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimonium, that he pleased Deus.",
  "By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the iustitia which is by fides.",
  "But without faith it is impossible to please Deus: for he that cometh to Deus must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.",
  "For the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets:",
  "Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought iustitia, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,",
  "Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.",
  "Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:",
  "And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:",
  "They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;",
  "(Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.",
  "And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:",
  "God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect."
