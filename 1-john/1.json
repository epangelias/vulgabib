  "That which was from the beginning, quod erat ab initio, which we have heard, quod audivimus, which we have seen with our eyes, quod viderimus, which we beheld, quod contemplati sumus, and our hands have handled, et manus nostrae palpaverunt, of the Word of life;",
  "For the life, vita, was manifested, manifestata est, and we have seen, et vidimus, and bear witness, et testamur, and shew unto you that eternal life, vitam aeternam, which was with the Father, quae erat apud Patrem, and was manifested, manifestata est, unto us;",
  "That which we have seen, quod vidimus, and heard, et audivimus, declare we unto you, annuntiamus vobis, that you also may have fellowship, ut et vos habatis communionem, with us: and truly, vere, our fellowship, communio nostra, is with the Father, cum Patre, and with his Son, et cum Filio eius, Jesus Christ.",
  "And these things, haec, write we unto you, scribimus vobis, that your joy, gaudium vestrum, may be full, plenum sit;",
  "This then, hoc ergo, is the message, nuntius, which we have heard, audivimus, of him, eius, and declare, annuntiamus, unto you, vobis, that God, Deus, is light, lux, and in him, in eo, is no darkness, tenebrae, at all, omnino;",
  "If we say, Si dicimus, that we have fellowship, habemus communionem, with him, cum eo, and walk, ambulamus, in darkness, in tenebris, we lie, mentimur, and do not, neque, the truth, veritatem;",
  "But if we walk, si ambulamus, in the light, in lumine, as he, sicut ipse, is in the light, in lumine, we have fellowship, habemus communionem, one with another, alter cum altero, and the blood, sanguis, of Jesus Christ, Iesu Christi, his Son, Filii eius, cleanseth us, mundat nos, from all sin, ab omni peccato;",
  "If we say, Si dicimus, that we have no sin, nullum habemus peccatum, we deceive, seducimus, ourselves, nos ipsos, and the truth, veritas, is not in us, non est in nobis;",
  "If we confess, Si confitemur, our sins, peccata nostra, he, ipse, is faithful, fidelis, and just, iustus, to forgive us, ut donet nobis, our sins, peccata nostra, and to cleanse us, et mundare nos, from all unrighteousness, ab omni iniquitate;",
  "If we say, Si dicimus, that we have not sinned, nullum peccatum habemus, we make, facimus, him, eum, a liar, mendacem, and his word, verbum eius, is not in us, non est in nobis."
