  "Then the mens of Ephraim said unto him, What hast thou therefore now? Say now in this: If thou hast magnanimus spiritus, why hast thou humiliatus nos, and not vocatus me to be with the exercitus?",
  "And he said unto them, What have I to do with thee, O thou garrula Ephraim? thou art as a avis which fugit before the leo: for when I clamavi in Monte Ephraim, who would ascend with me to the exercitus? and the Domini non respondit.",
  "Then said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth: and he said Sibboleth: for he could not recte pronuntiare it. Then they took him, and mactaverunt him at the vada Jordan: and there ceciderunt at that time of the Ephraimites quadraginta duo milia.",
