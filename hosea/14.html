                    <p>O Israel, return unto the Lord thy Deus, for thou hast fallen by thine iniquitas.</p>
<p>Take with you verba of Teshuvah, and turn to the Lord: say unto him, Take away all iniquitas, and receive us graciously: so will we offer the sacrificia of our lips.</p>
<p>Asshur shall not save us; we will not ride upon equus: neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, Ye are our dei: for in thee the fatherless findeth misericordia.</p>
<p>I will heal their aversio: I will love them freely: for mine ira is turned away from him.</p>
<p>I will be as ros to Israel: he shall flore as lilium, and he shall strike his radices as Libanus.</p>
<p>His rami shall expand, and his honorem shall be as Libanus.</p>
<p>They that dwell under his umbra shall revenire: they shall vivere as triticum, and flore as vinea: the odorem thereof shall be as vinum Libani.</p>
<p>Ephraim shall say, What have I to do any more with idola? I will hear him, and I will observare him: I am quasi abies fructifera; from me is thy fructus found.</p>
<p>Who is sapiens, and he shall intelligere these things? prudent, and he shall cognoscere them? for the viae of the Lord are rectae, and the justi shall ambulare in them: but the transgressores shall offend in eis.</p>
