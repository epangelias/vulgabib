  "Woe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! saith the Dominus.",
  "Therefore thus saith the Dominus Deus of Israel against the pastors that feed my people; Ye have scattered my flock, and driven them away, and have not visited them: behold, I will visit upon you the malice of your doings, saith the Dominus.",
  "And I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries whither I have driven them, and will bring them again to their folds; and they shall be fruitful and increase.",
  "And I will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them: and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall they be lacking, saith the Dominus.",
  "Behold, the days come, saith the Dominus, that I will raise unto David a just branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute iudicium and iustitia in the earth.",
  "In his days Iudaea shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this is his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.",
  "Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the Dominus, that they shall no more say, The Lord liveth, which brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Aegyptus;",
  "But, The Lord liveth, which brought up and which led the seed of the house of Israel out of the north country, and from all countries whither I had driven them; and they shall dwell in their own land.",
  "Mine heart within me is broken because of the prophets; all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom vinum hath overcome, because of the Dominus, and because of the words of his sanctuarium.",
  "For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing the land mourneth; the pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up, and their course is evil, and their force is not right.",
  "For both prophet and priest are profane; yea, in my house have I found their wickedness, saith the Dominus.",
  "Wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery ways in the obscurity; they shall be driven on, and fall therein: for I will bring upon them evil, the year of their visitation, saith the Dominus.",
  "And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they prophesied in Baal, and caused my people Israel to err.",
  "I have seen also in the prophets of Ierusalem a horrible thing; they commit adulterium, and walk in lies; they strengthen also the hands of evildoers, that none doth return from his wickedness: they are all of them unto me as Sodoma, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrha.",
  "Therefore thus saith the Dominus of hosts concerning the prophets; Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drink the water of gall: for from the prophets of Ierusalem is profaneness gone forth into all the land.",
  "Thus saith the Dominus of hosts, Hearken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you: they make you vain: they speak a vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of the Dominus.",
  "They say still unto them that despise me, The Dominus hath said, Ye shall have peace; and they say unto every one that walketh after the imagination of his own heart, No malum shall come upon you.",
  "For who hath stood in the consilium of the Dominus, and hath perceived and heard his word? who hath marked his word, and heard it?",
  "Behold, a whirlwind of the Dominus is gone forth in fury, even a grievous whirlwind: it shall fall grievously upon the head of the wicked.",
  "The anger of the Dominus shall not return, until he have executed, and till he have performed the thoughts of his heart: in the latter days ye shall consider it perfectly.",
  "I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran: I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied.",
  "But if they had stood in my consilium, and had caused my people to hear my words, then they should have turned them from their evil way, and from the malice of their doings.",
  "Am I a Deus at hand, saith the Dominus, and not a Deus afar off?",
  "Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him? saith the Dominus. Do not I fill caelum and terra?",
  "I have heard what the prophets said, that prophesy lies in my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed.",
  "How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies? yea, they are prophets of the deceit of their own heart;",
  "That think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour, as their fathers have forgotten my name for Baal.",
  "The prophet that hath a somnium, let him tell a somnium; and he that hath my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What is the chaff to the wheat? saith the Dominus.",
  "Is not my word like as ignis? saith the Dominus; and like a malleus that breaketh the rock in pieces?",
  "Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, saith the Dominus, that steal my words every one from his neighbour.",
  "Behold, I am against the prophets, saith the Dominus, that use their tongues, and say, He saith.",
  "Behold, I am against them that prophesy false somnia, saith the Dominus, and do tell them, and cause my people to err by their lies, and by their lightness; yet I sent them not, nor commanded them: therefore they shall not profit this people at all, saith the Dominus.",
  "And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask thee, saying, What is the burden of the Dominus? thou shalt then say unto them, What burden? I will even forsake you, saith the Dominus.",
  "And as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people, that shall say, The burden of the Dominus, I will even punish that man and his house.",
  "Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbour, and every one to his brother, What hath the Dominus answered? and, What hath the Dominus spoken?",
  "And the burden of the Dominus shall ye mention no more: for every man's word shall be his burden; for ye have perverted the words of the living Deus, of the Dominus of hosts our Deus;",
  "Thus shalt thou say to the prophet, What hath the Dominus answered thee? and, What hath the Dominus spoken?",
  "But since ye say, The burden of the Dominus; therefore thus saith the Dominus; Because ye say this word, The burden of the Dominus, and I have sent unto you, saying, Ye shall not say, The burden of the Dominus;",
  "Therefore, behold, I, even I, will utterly forget you, and I will forsake you, and the city that I gave you and your fathers, and cast you out of my presence:",
  "And I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a perpetual shame, that shall not be forgotten."
