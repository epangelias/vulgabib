                    <p>1 In the ninth year of Zedekiah rex of Judah, in the tenth mensem, Nebuchadrezzar rex of Babylon and all his exercitus came unto Jerusalem, and they besieged it.</p>
<p>2 In the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth mensem, the ninth die of the mensem, the city was breached.</p>
<p>3 All the principes of the rex of Babylon came in, and sat in the porta media: Nergalsharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, with all the rest of the officiales of the rex of Babylon.</p>
<p>4 And it came to pass, that when Zedekiah rex of Judah and all the men of war saw them, they fled, and went forth out of the city by nocte, by the via of the hortus of the rex, by the porta betwixt the two muri: and he went out the via of the desert.</p>
<p>5 But the exercitus of the Chaldees pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah in the desert plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar rex of Babylon to Riblah in the terra of Hamath, where he gave iudgement upon him.</p>
<p>6 Then the rex of Babylon slew the filii of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes: also the rex of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah.</p>
<p>7 Moreover he put out Zedekiah's oculi, and bound him with vincula of aes, to carry him to Babylon.</p>
<p>8 And the Chaldees burned the domus of the rex, and the domus of the populus, with ignem, and brake down the muri of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>9 Then Nebuzaradan the magister militum carried away captive into Babylon the remnant of the populus that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to him, with the rest of the populus that remained.</p>
<p>10 But Nebuzaradan the magister militum left of the poor of the populus, which had nothing, in the terra of Judah, and gave them vineas and agros at the same time.</p>
<p>11 Now Nebuchadrezzar rex of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the magister militum, saying,</p>
<p>12 Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do unto him even as he shall say unto thee.</p>
<p>13 So Nebuzaradan the magister militum sent, and Nebushasban, Rabsaris, and Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, and all the magistri militum of the rex of Babylon;</p>
<p>14 Even they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the atrium of the custodia, and committed him unto Gedaliah the filius of Ahikam the filius of Shaphan, that he should carry him home: so he dwelt among the populus.</p>
<p>15 Now the word of the Domini came unto Jeremiah, while he was shut up in the atrium of the custodia, saying,</p>
<p>16 Go and speak to Ebedmelech the Aethiops, saying, Thus saith the Domini of hosts, the Deus of Israel; Behold, I will bring my verba upon this city for malum, and not for bonum: and they shall be accomplished in that die before thee.</p>
<p>17 But I will deliver thee in that die, saith the Domini: and thou shalt not be given into the manus of the men of whom thou art afraid.</p>
<p>18 For I will surely save thee, and thou shalt not fall by gladius, but thy vita shall be for a spoil unto thee: because thou hast put thy trust in me, saith the Domini.</p>
