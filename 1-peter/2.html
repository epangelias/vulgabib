                    <p>Wherefore laying aside all malitia, and all guile, and hypocrisim, and envie, and all evil speakings,</p>
<p>As newborn babes, desiderate the sincere lactus of the word, that ye may grow thereby:</p>
<p>If so be ye have tasted that the Dominus is benignus:</p>
<p>To whom coming, as unto a living lapidea, disallowed indeed of men, but elect and precious in the sight of Dei;</p>
<p>Ye also, as viventes lapides, are built up a spiritual domus, an holy sacerdotium, to offer up sacrificia by Iesu Christ;</p>
<p>Wherefore also it is contained in the scriptura, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner petra, elect, precious:</p>
<p>And he that believeth on him shall not be confusus.</p>
<p>But ye are a elect generatio, a regalis sacerdotium, a sancta gens, a peculiar populus;</p>
<p>That ye should shew forth the virtutes of him who hath called you out of tenebrae into his marvellous lumen:</p>
<p>Which in time past were not a populus, yet are now the populus Dei;</p>
<p>Which had not obtained misericordiam, but now have obtained misericordiam.</p>
<p> Dearly beloved, I beseech you as peregrini and strangers, abstain from carnal desideria, which war against the anima;</p>
<p>Having your conversation honest among the gentes:</p>
<p>That whereas they speak against you as malorum, they may by your bonorum opera, which they shall behold, glorify Deum in the die visitationis.</p>
