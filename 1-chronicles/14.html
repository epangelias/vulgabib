                    <p>Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him an aedificium.</p>
<p>And David perceived that the Lord had confirmed him rex over Israel, for his regnum was lifted up on high, because of his populus, whom he had saved.</p>
<p>And David took more uxores in Jerusalem: and David begat filii and filiae.</p>
<p>And these be the nomina of them that were born unto him in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,</p>
<p>Ibhar also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,</p>
<p>And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet.</p>
<p>But when the Philistines heard that David was anointed rex over Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went out against them.</p>
<p>Now the Philistines had come and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.</p>
<p>And David inquired of the Lord, saying, Shall I go up to the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into mine manus? And the Lord said unto David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver them into thine manus.</p>
<p>And David came to Baalperazim, and David smote them there, and said, The Lord hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me, as the ruptura of aquae. Therefore he called the nomine of that place Baalperazim.</p>
<p>And there they left their simulacra, and David and his homines burned them.</p>
<p>And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley.</p>
<p>Therefore David inquired again of God; and God said unto him, Go not up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over against the balsam trees.</p>
<p>And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the balsam trees, that then thou shalt go out to battle: for God is gone forth before thee to smite the castra of the Philistines.</p>
<p>David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the castra of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer.</p>
<p>And the fama of David went out into all lands; and the Lord brought the formidinem of him upon all gentes.</p>
