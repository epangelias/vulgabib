                    <p>Now the word of the Dominus came unto Jonah the son of Amittai, saying,</p>
<p>Arise, go to Nineveh, that great civitas, and cry against it; for their malitia is come up before me.</p>
<p>But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the facies of the Dominus, and went down to Joppa; and he found a navis going to Tarshish: so he paid the naulum thereof, and went down into it, to go with them unto Tarshish from the facies of the Dominus.</p>
<p>But the Dominus sent out a great ventus into the mare, and there was a mighty tempest in the mare, so that the navis was like to be broken.</p>
<p>Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his deus, and cast forth the vasa that were in the navis into the mare, to lighten it of them. But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the navis; and he lay, and was dormiens.</p>
<p>So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What meanest thou, O sleeper? arise, call upon thy Deus, if so be that Deus will think upon us, that we perish not.</p>
<p>And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose causa this malum is upon us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah.</p>
<p>Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose causa this malum is upon us; What is thine occupation? and whence comest thou? what is thy terra? and of what gens art thou?</p>
<p>And he said unto them, I am an Hebrew; and I fear the Dominus, the Deus of the caelum, which hath made the mare and the terra.</p>
<p>Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him, Why hast thou done this? For the men knew that he fled from the facies of the Dominus, because he had told them.</p>
<p>Then said they unto him, What shall we do unto thee, that the mare may be calm unto us? for the mare wrought, and was tempestuous.</p>
<p>And he said unto them, Take me up, and project me forth into the mare; so shall the mare be calm unto you: for I know that for my causa this great tempest is upon you.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the terra; but they could not: for the mare wrought, and was tempestuous against them.</p>
<p>Wherefore they cried unto the Dominus, and said, We beseech thee, O Dominus, we beseech thee, let us not perish for this man's vita, and lay not upon us innocent sanguinem: for thou, O Dominus, hast done as it pleased thee.</p>
<p>So they took up Jonah, and project him forth into the mare: and the mare ceased from her furor.</p>
<p>Then the men feared the Dominus exceedingly, and offered sacrificium unto the Dominus, and made vota.</p>
<p>Now the Dominus had prepared a great piscis to swallow up Jonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the piscis three dies and three noctes.</p>
<p>Then Jonah prayed unto the Dominus his Deus out of the belly of the piscis,</p>
<p>And said, I cried by reason of mine afflictio unto the Dominus, and he heard me; out of the belly of infernus cried I, and thou heardest my vox.</p>
<p>For thou hadst cast me into the profundum, in the midst of the mare; and the flumen compassed me about: all thy billows and thy waves passed over me.</p>
<p>Then I said, I am cast out of the sight of thine oculi; yet I will look again toward thy templum.</p>
<p>The waters compassed me about, even to the anima: the profundum closed me round about, the alga was wrapped round my caput.</p>
<p>I went down to the fundamenta of the montes; the earth with her bars was about me for ever: yet hast thou brought up my vita from corruption, O Dominus my Deus.</p>
<p>When my anima fainted within me I remembered the Dominus: and my prayer came in unto thee, into thine aures holy templum.</p>
<p>They that observe lying vanitates forsake their misericordia.</p>
<p>But I will sacrifice unto thee with the vox of laudis; I will pay that that I have vowed. Salvation is of the Dominus.</p>
<p>And the Dominus spake unto the piscis, and it vomited out Jonah upon the terra.</p>
