  "For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high Deus, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;",
  "To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation king of iustitia, and after that also king of Salem, which is, King of Pax;",
  "Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither principio nor finis of days, but made like unto the Filium Dei; abideth a sacerdos continually.",
  "Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.",
  "And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the sacerdotium, have a commandment to take the tenth from the populus according to the law, that is, from their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham;",
  "But he whose descent is not counted from them received the tenth of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promissio of the Dei.",
  "And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.",
  "And here men that die receive the tenth; but there he receiveth them, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.",
  "And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth the tenth, paid the tenth in Abraham.",
  "For he was yet in the loins of Abraham when Melchisedec met him.",
  "If therefore perfection were by the Levitical sacerdotium, (for under it the populus received the law,) what further need was there that another sacerdos should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?",
  "For the sacerdotium being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the lex.",
  "For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribus, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.",
  "For it is evident that our Dominus sprang out of Iuda; of which tribus Moses spake nothing concerning sacerdotium.",
  "And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another sacerdos,"
