                    <p>Praise the Dominus. I will give thanks unto the Dominus with my whole cor, in the assembly of the recti, and in the congregation.</p>
<p>The works of the Dominus are great, sought out of all them that have delectation therein.</p>
<p>His opera is honour and magnificentia: and his iustitia endureth for ever.</p>
<p>He hath made his mirabilia to be remembered: the Dominus is gratia and misericordia.</p>
<p>He hath given alimentum to them that timor the Dominus: he will ever be mindful of his testamentum.</p>
<p>He hath shewed his populus the potentiam of his opera, that he may give them the hereditas of the gentes.</p>
<p>The opera of his manus are veritas and iustitia; all his mandata are fidelia.</p>
<p>They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in veritas and rectitudine.</p>
<p>He sent redemptio unto his populus: he hath commandatum his foedus for ever: sanctus and terribilis is his Nomen.</p>
<p>Initium sapientiae is timor Domini: a prudentibus qui faciunt iudicium: laus eius manet in saeculum saeculi.</p>
