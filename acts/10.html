                    <p>There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian cohort,</p>
<p>A devout man, and one that feared Deum, with all his house, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to Deus always.</p>
<p>He saw in a visio, evidently about the ninth hora of the day, an angel of Deus coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius.</p>
<p>And when he looked on him, he was terrified, and said, Quid est, Domine? And he said unto him, Thy orationes and thine eleemosynae are come up for a memorial before Deus.</p>
<p>And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname is Petrus:</p>
<p>He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side: he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do.</p>
<p>And when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually;</p>
<p>And when he had declared all these things unto them, he sent them to Joppa.</p>
<p>On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Petrus went up upon the tectum to pray about the sixth hora:</p>
<p>And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance,</p>
<p>And saw caelum opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the terra:</p>
<p>Wherein were all manner of quadrupedae, and serpentes, and those that creep on the terra, and aves of the caelum.</p>
<p>And there came a vox to him, Rise, Petrus; kill and eat.</p>
<p>But Petrus said, Not so, Domine; for I have never eaten any thing that is commune or unclean.</p>
<p>And the vox spake unto him again the second time, What Deus hath purified, that call not thou impurum.</p>
<p>This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into caelum.</p>
<p>Now while Petrus doubted in himself what this visio which he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had made enquiry for Simon's house, and stood before the gate,</p>
<p>And called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Petrus, were lodged there.</p>
<p>While Petrus thought on the visio, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee.</p>
<p>Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them.</p>
<p>Then Petrus went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the causa wherefore ye are come?</p>
<p>And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth Deus, and of good report among all the nation of the Judaei, was warned from Deus by an holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee.</p>
<p>Then called he them in, and lodged them. And on the morrow Petrus went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him.</p>
<p>And the morrow after they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius waited for them, and had called together his kinsmen and near friends.</p>
<p>And as Petrus was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him.</p>
<p>But Petrus took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a homo.</p>
<p>And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together.</p>
<p>And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a homo Judaeus to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but Deus hath shewed me that I should not call any homo impurum, or unclean.</p>
<p>Therefore came I unto you without gainsaying, as soon as I was sent for: I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me?</p>
<p>And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hora; and at the ninth hora I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in shining vestibus,</p>
<p>Saying, Cornelius, thy orationes are heard, and thine eleemosynae are had in remembrance in the sight of Deus.</p>
<p>Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is Petrus; he is lodged in the house of one Simon a tanner by the sea side: who, when he cometh, shall speak unto thee.</p>
<p>Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done that thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present before Deus, to hear all things that are commanded thee of Deus.</p>
<p>Then Petrus opened his mouth, and said, Of a verity I perceive that Deus is no respecter of personae:</p>
<p>But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.</p>
<p>The word which Deus sent unto the children of Israel, preaching bonum nuntium of pace by Jesus Christ: (he is Dominus of all:)</p>
<p>That word, I say, ye know, which was published throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilaea, after the baptismum which Johannes preached;</p>
<p>How Deus anointed Jesus of Nazareth with Spiritu Sancto and with potentia: who went about doing beneficium, and healing all that were oppressed of the diabolus; for Deus was with him.</p>
<p>And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Judaei, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a lignum:</p>
<p>Him Deus raised up the third dies, and shewed him openly;</p>
<p>Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of Deus, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead.</p>
<p>And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of Deus to be Judex of vivi and mortui.</p>
<p>To him give all the prophetae testimony, that through his nomen whosoever believeth in him shall receive remissio peccatorum.</p>
<p>While Petrus yet spake these words, the Spiritu Sancto fell on all them which heard the word.</p>
<p>And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Petrus, because that on the gentes also was poured out the donum of the Spiritu Sancto.</p>
<p>For they heard them speak with linguae, and magnify Deus. Then answered Petrus,</p>
<p>Can any man forbid aquam, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Spiritu Sancto as well as we?</p>
<p>And he commanded them to be baptized in the nomen of the Dominus. Then prayed they him to tarry certain dies.</p>
