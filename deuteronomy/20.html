                    <p>When thou goest out to battle against thine enemies, and seest horses, and chariots, and a people more than thou, be not afraid of them: for the Lord thy Deus is with thee, which brought thee up out of the terra of Egypt.</p>
<p>And it shall be, when ye are come nigh unto the civitas which ye shall besiege, that thou shalt offer them pacem.</p>
<p>And it shall be, if they refuse to make pacem with thee, and will make war against thee, then thou shalt besiege it:</p>
<p>And when the Lord thy Deus hath delivered it into thine hands, thou shalt smite every male thereof with the gladius:</p>
<p>But the mulieres, and the parvuli, and the jumenta, and all that is in the civitas, even all the spoil thereof, shalt thou take unto thyself; and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies, which the Lord thy Deus hath given thee.</p>
<p>Thus shalt thou do unto all the civitates which are very far off from thee, which are not of the civitates of these gentes.</p>
<p>But of the civitates of these gentes, which the Lord thy Deus doth give thee for an hereditas, thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth:</p>
<p>But thou shalt utterly destroy them; namely, the Hittites, and the Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; as the Lord thy Deus hath commanded thee:</p>
<p>That they teach you not to do after all their abomination, which they have done unto their dei, so ye sin not against the Lord your Deus.</p>
<p>When thou shalt besiege a civitas a long time, in making war against it to take it, thou shalt not destroy the lignum thereof by forcing an ferrum against it: for thou mayest eat of it, and thou shalt not cut it down (for the lignum of the field is man's life):</p>
<p>Only the lignum which thou knowest that it is not a lignum for meat, thou shalt destroy and cut down; and thou shalt build bulwarks against the civitas that maketh war with thee, until it be subdued.</p>
