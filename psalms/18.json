  "I will love thee, O Domine, my fortitudo.",
  "The Domine is my rock, and my deliverer; my Deus, my trust, in whom I will put my hope; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower.",
  "I will call upon the Domine, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.",
  "The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of Belial made me afraid.",
  "The sorrows of Sheol compassed me, and the snares of death prevented me.",
  "In my distress I called upon the Domine, and cried unto my Deus: he heard my voice out of his templum, and my cry came before him, even into his aures.",
  "Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the montes were moved and shaken, because he was wroth.",
  "There went up a smoke out of his nasus, and fire out of his os devoured: coals were kindled by it.",
  "He bowed the caelum also, and came down: and darkness was under his pedes.",
  "And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the ventus.",
  "He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the caelum.",
  "At the brightness that was before him his clouds passed, hail stones and coals of fire.",
  "The Domine also thundered in the caelum, and the Highest gave his voice; hail stones and coals of fire.",
  "Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them.",
  "Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the montes were discovered at thy rebuke, O Domine, at the blast of the spirit of thy indignation.",
  "He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many aquae.",
  "He delivered me from my potentis enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were too strong for me.",
  "They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the Domine was my stay.",
  "He brought me forth also into a spatium largum: he delivered me, because he delighted in me.",
  "The Domine rewarded me according to my justitia; according to the puritas of my manus hath he recompensed me.",
  "For I have kept the ways of the Domine, and have not wickedly departed from my Deus.",
  "For all his judicia were before me, and I did not put away his statuta from me.",
  "I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquitas.",
  "Therefore hath the Domine recompensed me according to my justitia, according to the puritas of my manus in his sight.",
  "With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;",
  "With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward.",
  "For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high looks.",
  "For thou wilt light my candle: the Domine my Deus will enlighten my darkness.",
  "For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my Deus have I leaped over a wall.",
  "As for Deus, his way is perfect: the word of the Domine is tried: he is a buckler to all those that trust in him.",
  "For who is Deus save the Domine? or who is a rock save our Deus?",
  "It is Deus that girdeth me with fortitudo, and maketh my way perfect.",
  "He maketh my feet like hinds' feet, and setteth me upon my high places.",
  "He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.",
  "Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great.",
  "Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.",
  "I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed.",
  "I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet.",
  "For thou hast girded me with fortitudo unto the battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.",
  "Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me.",
  "They cried, but there was none to save them: even unto the Domine, but he answered them not.",
  "Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets.",
  "Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and thou hast made me the head of the Gentiles: a people whom I have not known shall serve me.",
  "As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto me.",
  "The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places.",
  "The Domine liveth; and blessed be my rock; and let the Deus of my salvation be exalted.",
  "It is Deus that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.",
  "He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.",
  "Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O Domine, among the Gentiles, and sing praises unto thy Nomen.",
  "Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore."
