                    <p>Afterward he brought me again unto the door of the house; and, behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward: for the forefront of the house stood toward the east, and the waters came down from under from the right side of the house, at the south side of the altar.</p>
<p>Then brought he me out of the way of the gate northward, and led me about the way without unto the utter gate by the way that looketh eastward; and, behold, there ran out waters on the right side.</p>
<p>And when the man that had the line in his hand went forth eastward, he measured a thousand cubits, and he brought me through the waters; the waters were to the ankles.</p>
<p>Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through the waters; the waters were to the knees. Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through; the waters were to the loins.</p>
<p>Afterward he measured a thousand; and it was a rivus that I could not pass over: for the waters were risen, waisted in profundum, to swim in, a rivus that could not be passed over.</p>
<p>And he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen this? Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the ripa of the rivus.</p>
<p>Now when I had returned, behold, at the ripa of the rivus were very many arbores on the one side and on the other.</p>
<p>Then said he unto me, These waters issue out toward the oriental region, and run down into the vallis, and go into the mare, and being brought forth into the mare, the waters shall be healed.</p>
<p>And it shall come to pass, that every thing that liveth, which moveth, whithersoever the rivus cometh, shall live: and there shall be a very great multitude of pisces, because these waters shall come thither: for they shall be healed; and every thing shall live whither the rivus cometh.</p>
<p>And it shall come to pass, that the fishers shall stand upon it from Engedi even unto Eneglaim; they shall be a place to spread forth nets; their fish shall be according to their kinds, as the fish of the Great Mare, exceeding many.</p>
<p>But the miry places thereof and the marisces shall not be healed; they shall be given to sal.</p>
<p>And by the rivus upon the ripa thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow all trees for food, whose leaf shall not fade, neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed: it shall bring forth new fruit according to his months, because their waters they issued out of the sanctum; and the fruit thereof shall be for food, and the leaf thereof for medicina.</p>
<p>Thus saith the Dominus Deus; This shall be the border, whereby ye shall inherit the terra according to the twelve tribes of Israel: Joseph shall have two partes.</p>
<p>And ye shall inherit it, one as well as another: concerning the which I lifted up mine hand to give it unto your fathers: and this terra shall fall unto you for inheritance.</p>
<p>And this shall be the border of the terra toward the north side, from the Great Mare, the way of Hethlon, as men go to Zedad;</p>
<p>Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazarhatticon, which is by the coast of Hauran.</p>
<p>And the border from the sea shall be Hazarenan, the border of Damascus, and the north northward, and the border of Hamath. And this is the north side.</p>
<p>And the east side ye shall measure from Hauran, and from Damascus, and from Gilead, and from the terra of Israel by Jordan, from the border unto the East Sea. And this is the east side.</p>
<p>And the south side southward, from Tamar even to the waters of strife in Kadesh, the river to the Great Sea. And this is the south side southward.</p>
<p>The west side also shall be the Great Sea from the border, till a man come over against Hamath. This is the west side.</p>
<p>So shall ye divide this terra unto you according to the tribes of Israel.</p>
<p>And it shall be unto you for inheritance, and unto the strangers that sojourn among you, and have gotten children among you: and they shall be unto you as born among you, among the filii Israel; they shall have inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel.</p>
<p>And it shall be, that ye shall divide it by lot for an inheritance unto you, and to the strangers that sojourn among you, which shall beget filii among you: and they shall be unto you as filii of the terra among the filii of Israel; they shall have inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel.</p>
<p>And the prince shall not take of the people's inheritance, and thrust them not out of their possession: but he shall give his filii an inheritance out of his own possession: that my people be not scattered every man from his possession.</p>
<p>Moreover the prince shall not take of the people's inheritance by oppression, to thrust them out of their possession; but he shall give his possession to his filii out of his own possession: that my people be not scattered every man from his possession.</p>
<p>Thus saith the Dominus Deus; Let it suffice you, O princes of Israel: remove violence and spoil, and execute judgment and righteousness, take away your exactions from my people, saith the Dominus Deus.</p>
<p>Ye shall have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath.</p>
<p>That the ephah and the bath may be of one measure, that the bath may contain the tenth part of an homer, and the ephah the tenth part of an homer: the measure thereof shall be after the homer.</p>
<p>And the shekel shall be twenty gerahs: twenty shekels, five and twenty shekels, fifteen shekels, shall be your maneh.</p>
<p>This is the oblation that ye shall offer; the sixth part of an ephah of an homer of wheat, and ye shall give the sixth part of an ephah of an homer of barley;</p>
<p>Concerning the oblation of the king, that ye shall offer unto the Dominus in the Sabbaths, and in the new moons, and in the solemn feasts, by number, according to the ordinance.</p>
<p>And thus ye shall offer daily unto the Dominus, bullocks of the herd, for a perpetual holocaust.</p>
<p>Seven days shall the prince prepare it, an he goat also daily, and seven days of the menses; so shall seven days be in the solemn feast of the unleavened panis.</p>
<p>And on the day that he goeth into the sanctum, into the atrium within, to minister in the sanctum, he shall offer his holocaust unto the Dominus, and the holocaust of the people, and their peccata and holocaust, and their hostia of peace offering, that they may obtain remission of peccata and purification, saith the Dominus Deus.</p>
<p>Now when these days are expired, it shall be that all the people that are found within the gates of Israel, shall know that I am the Dominus their Deus.</p>
<p>The house of Israel shall not be polluted with their idola, and the carcasses of their kings in the midst of them.</p>
<p>And they shall know that I am the Dominus Deus, that I may sanctify them, and that I am in the midst of them for evermore.</p>
<p>And they shall know that the propheta is among them, in the midst of the terra, I the Dominus Deus.</p>
<p>The house of the propheta shall not defile themselves with any of their peccata, from the prince unto the last of the populus; neither shall they steal from the possession of the people, lest they pollute the terra of the inheritance before me.</p>
<p>The prince shall not take from the inheritance of the terra of the possession of the populus, that they may not remove the populus out of their possession, lest the land of their possession be defiled before me.</p>
