  "1 The burden of Damascus. Behold, Damascus is taken away from being a citadel, and it shall be a ruinous heap.",
  "2 The cities of Aroer are forsaken: they shall be for flocks, which shall lie down, and none shall make them afraid.",
  "3 The fortress also shall cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom from Damascus, and the remnant of Syria: they shall be as the glory of the children of Israel, saith the Dominus Deus.",
  "4 And in that day it shall come to pass, that the glory of Jacob shall be made thin, and the robur of his flesh shall wax lean.",
  "5 And it shall be as when the messisman gathereth the spicas, and his manus reaps the ears, and it shall be as the gathering of the spicas of the valley of Rephaim.",
  "6 Yet gleaning grapes shall be left in it, as the shaking of an olive tree, two or three berries in the summit of the uppermost branches, four or five in the fruit thereof.",
  "7 At that day shall a man look to his Maker, and his oculi shall have respect to the Sanctus Israel.",
  "8 And he shall not look to the altars, the opus of his manus, neither shall respect that which his fingers have made, either the groves, or the images.",
  "9 In that day shall his strong cities be as a forsaken bough, and an uppermost branch, which they left because of the children of Israel: and there shall be desolation.",
  "10 Because thou hast forgotten the Deus of thy salvation, and hast not been mindful of the Petra in which thou trustedst, therefore thou hast planted pleasant plantas, and hast sown strange vineas.",
  "11 In the day shalt thou make thy plantas to grow, and in the morning shalt thou make thy sementes to flourish: but the harvest shall be a heap in the day of grief and desperate dolor.",
  "12 Woe to the multitude of many people, which make a noise like the noise of the maris, and to the rushing of nations, that make a rushing like the rushing of many aquae.",
  "13 The nations shall rush like the rushing of many aquae: but Deus shall rebuke them, and they shall flee far off, and shall be chased as the pulvis of the montes before the ventus, and like a rolling thing before the turbine.",
  "14 And behold at eveningtide trouble; and before the morning he is not. This is the portion of them that spoil us, and the lot of them that rob us."
