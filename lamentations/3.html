                    <p>I am the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his indignatio, his indignantia, and hath gone after him, and hath found him: he hath led me, and brought me into darkness, but not into lux.</p>
<p>Surely against me is he turned; he turneth his manus, and he striketh me all the day, my carne and my skin.</p>
<p>He hath built against me, and compassed me with gall and travail, laqueus and afflictio.</p>
<p>He hath set me in dark places, as they that be dead of old, sepulchrum.</p>
<p>He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out: he hath made my chain heavy, vinculum.</p>
<p>He hath also set me in dark places, as in a sepulchrum, that I should not see lux.</p>
<p>When I cry and shout, he shutteth out my oratio, and he heareth not my vocem, my clamor.</p>
<p>He hath inclosed my ways with petrae, and turned aside my semitas.</p>
<p>He is unto me as a bear lying in wait, and as a leo in secret places.</p>
<p>He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he hath made me desolate, vastitas.</p>
<p>He hath bent his arcus, and set me as a mark for the sagitta, his sagittae.</p>
<p>He hath caused the arrows of his pharetra to enter into my renes, my lumbi.</p>
<p>I was a derision to all my people; and their canticum, their ioci, all the day.</p>
<p>He hath filled me with bitterness, amaritudo, and made me drunken with wormwood, absinthium.</p>
<p>And he hath broken my dentes with gravel stones, lapides, and covered me with cinis, ashes.</p>
<p>And thou hast removed my soul far off from pax, and I forgot prosperitas.</p>
<p>And I said, My virtus and my spes from the Lord is perished, periit.</p>
<p>Remember my affliction and my misery, my wandering, my wormwood and my gall, fel.</p>
<p>My soul hath them still in remembrance, and is humbled in me, humiliata.</p>
<p>This I recall to my mind, therefore have I spes, patientia.</p>
<p>It is of the Lord's misericordia that we are not consumed, because his clementia, his pietas, faileth not.</p>
<p>They are new every mane, every morning: great is thy fidelitas.</p>
<p>The Lord is my portio, my hereditas, therefore I will spes, patientia in him.</p>
<p>The Lord is bonus, and a stronghold in the day of tribulatio, and he knoweth them that spes, patientia in him.</p>
<p>But I will spes, patientia, and will add to all my oratio, and to all my clamor.</p>
<p>He hath not closed his aures from my oratio, from my clamor.</p>
<p>But thou hast covered thyself with ira, and pursuedst them, and destroyedst them, and hast not spared, non pepercit.</p>
<p>Thou hast also covered thyself with a nubis, that no oratio, no prex, should pass through.</p>
<p>Thou hast made me as the scoria of the people, and the spittle, sputum, of the multitude.</p>
<p>All my enemies have opened their os, against me, in malum, in malitia.</p>
<p>Fear and a snare is come upon me, pavor, and horror, and ruina.</p>
<p>And I said, These things I will remember, and have spes, patientia.</p>
<p>This I recall to my mind, therefore have I spes, patientia.</p>
<p>It is of the Lord's misericordia that we are not consumed, because his clementia, his pietas, faileth not.</p>
<p>They are new every mane, every morning: great is thy fidelitas.</p>
<p>The Lord is my portio, my hereditas, therefore I will spes, patientia in him.</p>
<p>The Lord is bonus, and a stronghold in the day of tribulatio, and he knoweth them that spes, patientia in him.</p>
<p>It is bonus for a man that he bear the iugum, the burden, and the disciplina of his iuventus, his young age.</p>
<p>He sitteth alone and keepeth silent, tacitus, because he hath borne it upon him.</p>
<p>He putteth his os in the dust; if so be there may be spes, patientia.</p>
<p>He giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him, and he is filled with opprobrium, and with contumelia.</p>
<p>For the Lord will not cast off for ever, non abiciet in aeternum.</p>
<p>But though he cause grief, contritio, yet will he have compassion, misericordia, according to the multitude of his clementia, his pietas.</p>
<p>For he doth not afflict willingly, non affligit delectatione, nor grieve the children of men, filios hominum.</p>
<p>To crush under his feet all the captivos of the terra, all the prisoners of the terra.</p>
<p>To turn aside the ius of a man before the face of the Most High, and to subvert a man in his causa, his iudicium.</p>
<p>A man's ius, and his iudicium, will the Lord not see, non videbit?</p>
<p>Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord commandeth it not?</p>
<p>Out of the os of the Most High proceedeth not malum, and bonum, and misericordia, and ira? why doth a living man complain, murmurat, a vir vivens, of the peccatum of his via, his way?</p>
<p>Let us search and try our vias, and turn again to the Lord, and let us lift up our cor, our heart, with manus, our hands, unto God in the coelum, the heavens.</p>
<p>We acknowledge, confitemur, O Lord, our iniquitas, our iniquitas, and the iniquitas of our patres, our fathers, for we have sinned, peccavimus, against thee.</p>
<p>Do not abscindas, do not cut off for ever, and do not cover thy facies, thy face, from us, ne abscondas a nobis, ne avertas faciem tuam a nobis.</p>
<p>Attend to us, inclina ad nos, for we are in magno, in great misery, and in magno, in great contempt.</p>
<p>And thou, O Lord, hast covered thyself with ira, and pursuedst them, and destroyedst them, and hast not spared, non pepercit.</p>
<p>Thou hast covered thyself with a nubis, that no oratio, no prex, should pass through.</p>
<p>Thou hast made me as the scoria of the people, and the sputum, the spittle, of the multitude.</p>
