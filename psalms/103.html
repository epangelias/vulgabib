                    <p>Bless the Lord, O my animus, and all that is within me, bless his holy Nomen.</p>
<p>Bless the Lord, O my animus, and forget not all his beneficia:</p>
<p>Who forgiveth all thine iniquitates; who healeth all thy languores;</p>
<p>Who redeemeth thy vita from destruction; who crowneth thee with benignitas and misericordia;</p>
<p>Who satisfieth thy desiderium with bonum things; so that thy iuventus is renewed like the aquila's.</p>
<p>The Lord executeth righteousness and iustitia for all that are oppressed.</p>
<p>He made known his viæ to Moses, his opera to the filii of Israel.</p>
<p>The Lord is clemens and misericors, slow to ira, and plenus of benignitas.</p>
<p>He will not always contend; neither will he keep his indignatio for ever.</p>
<p>He hath not dealt with us according to our peccata, nor rewarded us according to our iniquitates.</p>
<p>For as the cœlestes are high above the terra, so great is his benignitas toward them that fear him.</p>
<p>As far as the orient is from the occident, so far hath he removed our transgressiones from us.</p>
<p>Like as a pater pitieth his filios, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him.</p>
<p>For he knoweth our fabrica; he remembereth that we are pulvis.</p>
<p>As for homo, his dies are as herba, and as a flos of the ager, so he floruieth.</p>
<p>For the ventus passeth over it, and it is not; and the locum thereof shall know it no more.</p>
<p>But the benignitas of the Lord is from æternum to æternum upon them that fear him, and his iustitia upon filios filiorum;</p>
<p>Upon those that keep his pactum, and upon those that remember his mandata to do them.</p>
<p>The Lord hath prepared his thronus in cœlis; and his regnum dominion over all.</p>
<p>Bless the Lord, ye his Angeli, that excel in fortitudo, that do his mandatum, hearkening unto the vox of his verbum.</p>
<p>Bless ye the Lord, all ye exercitus of his, ye ministri of his, that do his voluntas;</p>
<p>Bless the Lord, all his opera, in all locis of his dominion: bless the Lord, O my animus.</p>
