[
  "How long, O Deus, wilt thou forget me for ever? how long wilt thou hide thy faciem from me?",
  "How long shall I take counsel in my animus, having sorrow in my cor in the day?",
  "How long shall mine inimicus be exalted over me?",
  "Consider and hear me, O Deus: lighten mine oculi, lest I sleep the somnus of morte;",
  "Lest mine inimicus say, I have prevailed against him; and those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved;",
  "But I have trusted in thy misericordia; my cor shall rejoice in thy salvus:",
  "I will sing unto Deus, because he hath dealt bountifully with me."
