  "1 Hear this word, ye kine of Bashan, that are in the mountain of Samaria, which oppress the poor, which crush the needy, which say to their masters, Bring, and let us drink.",
  "2 The Dominus Deus hath sworn by his sanctuarium, I will not forget any of their works.",
  "3 And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Dominus Deus, that I will cause the sun to go down at noon, and I will darken the earth in the clear day:",
  "4 And I will turn your festival days into lamentation, and all your songs into lamentation; and I will bring up sackcloth upon all loins, and baldness upon every head; and I will make it as the mourning of an unicus filius, and the end thereof as a bitter dies.",
  "5 And it shall come to pass, saith the Dominus Deus, that the enemies shall come, and they shall waste your cities, and ye shall be scattered upon the montes, and ye shall be devoured.",
  "6 And ye shall know that I am the Dominus, when I shall have done these things in the midst of thee.",
  "7 But, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, O house of Israel, saith the Dominus Deus of the exercitus, and they shall afflict you from the introitus Hamath unto the rivus of the desert.",
  "8 Thus hath the Dominus Deus shewed unto me: and, behold, the Dominus Deus called to contend by the ignis, and it devoured the great abysmus, and did eat up a part.",
  "9 Then said I, O Dominus Deus, cease, I pray thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he is small.",
  "10 Thus hath the Dominus Deus shewed unto me: and, behold, the Dominus Deus called to contend by the ignis, and it devoured the great abysmus, and did eat up a part.",
  "11 Behold, the dies of the Dominus come, cruel both with furor and ire, to lay the land desolate: and he shall destroy from it the salus of the peccatores.",
  "12 And it shall come to pass, as the shepherd taketh out of the ore his gregem, or as one rescueth from the ore the pes of the leon, two pedes, or a cauda of an aureus pes.",
  "13 Thus shall the filii Israelis be rescued, who dwell in Samaria in the anglus of a lectus, and in Damascus in aGrabatum."
