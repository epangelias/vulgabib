                    <p>My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, if thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger, thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.</p>
<p>Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend.</p>
<p>Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids, deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.</p>
<p>Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise: qui laborat, non requiescit, qui autem non laborat, non habet.</p>
<p>How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep? Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:</p>
<p>So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.</p>
<p>I went by the field of the sluggard, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding; et vide, it was all grown over with thorns, and nettles had covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was broken down.</p>
<p>Then I saw, and considered it well: I looked upon it, and received instruction.</p>
<p>Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep: So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.</p>
<p>A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth, subigit linguam suam, qui disponit scelera, invenit mala.</p>
<p>He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers; perversitas est in corde eius, semper concupiscit mala.</p>
<p>Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord.</p>
<p>Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy.</p>
<p>These six things doth the Lord hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him: oculi alti, lingua mendax, manus, quae effundunt sanguinem innocentem,</p>
<p>A heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief, a false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.</p>
<p>My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother: ligatura cordis tui, semper memineris, et non obliviscaris sermones matris tuae.</p>
<p>Bind them continually upon thine heart, and tie them about thy neck.</p>
<p>When thou walkest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.</p>
<p>For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life:</p>
<p>To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.</p>
<p>Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids.</p>
<p>For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adultress will hunt for the precious life.</p>
<p>Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?</p>
<p>Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?</p>
<p>So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent.</p>
<p>Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;</p>
<p>But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.</p>
<p>But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: qui facit, perdet animam suam.</p>
<p>He that doth it destroyeth his own soul: a wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.</p>
<p>For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.</p>
<p>He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.</p>
