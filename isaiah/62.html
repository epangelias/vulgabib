                    <p>1 For Zion's sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, until the righteousnes of it go forth as luminaria, and the salvation thereof as lux,</p>
<p>2 And Gentiles shall see thy justitia, and all kings thy gloriam: and thou shalt be called by a new nomine, which the mouth of the Lord shall nominate.</p>
<p>3 Thou shalt also be a corona of gloria in the hand of the Lord, and a regalis diadema in the hand of thy God.</p>
<p>4 Thou shalt no more be termed Desolata, but thou shalt be called Hephzibah, and thy land Beulah: for the Lord delighteth in thee, and thy land shall be married.</p>
<p>5 For as a young man marieth a virgine, so shall thy filii marry thee: and as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the sponsa, so shall thy God rejoice over thee.</p>
<p>6 I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, qui tota die et tota nocte shall never be silent: ye that make mention of the Lord, take no rest,</p>
<p>7 And give him no silence, till he establish, and till he make Jerusalem a laus in the earth.</p>
<p>8 The Lord hath juramentum by his right hand, and by the brachium of his potentia, I will no more give thy cibus to thy inimici, and the filii of the alienigena shall not drink thy vinum for which thou hast labored:</p>
<p>9 But they that collecta the cibus shall eat it, and they that collecta the vinum shall drink it in the atrio of my Sanctuarium: thus speaketh the Lord,</p>
<p>10 Go through, go through the porta, prepare ye the way of the people; cast up, cast up the viam, gather out the lapides, lift up a signum for the people.</p>
<p>11 Behold, the Lord hath proclaimed unto the finem of the terra, Say ye to the filia of Zion, Behold, thy Salvator cometh; behold, his merces is with him, and his opera before him.</p>
<p>12 And they shall call them, The Sancti people, The redempti of the Lord: and thou shalt be called, A civitas quaerens non derelinquenda.</p>
