                    <p>This know also, that in the last dies, perilous tempora shall come.</p>
<p>For men shall be lovers of their own personas, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</p>
<p>Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,</p>
<p>Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of Deus,</p>
<p>Having a form of pietas, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.</p>
<p>For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly mulieres laden with sins, led away with divers desideria,</p>
<p>Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of veritas.</p>
<p>Now as Jannes and Jambres resisted Moyses, so do these also resist the veritas: men of corrupted minds, reprobate concerning the fides:</p>
<p>But they shall proceed no further: for their stultitia shall be manifest unto all men, as theirs also was.</p>
<p>But thou hast fully known my doctrina, manner of life, purpose, fides, longsuffering, charity, patience,</p>
<p>Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of them all the Dominus delivered me.</p>
<p>Yea, and all that will live godly in Christo Jesus shall suffer persecutio.</p>
<p>But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.</p>
<p>But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them;</p>
<p>And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through fides which is in Christo Jesus.</p>
<p>All scripture is given by inspiratio of Deus, and is profitable for doctrina, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in justitia:</p>
<p>That the man of Deus may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all bonne opera.</p>
