  "Save me, O Deus, by thy name, and judge me by thy potentia.",
  "Hear my oratio, O Deus; give ear to the words of my os.",
  "For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressores seek after my anima: they have not set Deus before them. Selah.",
  "Behold, Deus is mine adiutor: the Domini that doth sustain my anima.",
  "He shall reward evil unto mine inimici: cut them off in thy veritas.",
  "I will freely sacrifice unto thee: I will praise thy nomen, O Deus; for it is bonum.",
  "For he hath delivered me out of all tribulatio; and mine oculi have seen my desiderium upon mine inimici."
