                    <p>1 Then came the word of the Dominus unto me, saying, 2 Son of homo, What is the lignum of the vine more than any lignum, the virga that is among the ligna of the silva?</p>
<p>3 Shall lignum be taken thereof to do any work? or will men take a peg of it to hang any vessel thereon?</p>
<p>4 Behold, it is cast into ignis for fuel; the flamma hath devoured both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned. Is it meet for any work?</p>
<p>5 Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less shall it be meet yet for any work, when the ignis hath devoured it, and it is burned?</p>
<p>6 Therefore thus saith the Dominus Deus; As the lignum of the vine among the ligna of the silva, which I have given to the ignis for fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of Hierusalem.</p>
<p>7 And I will set my facies against them; they shall go out from one ignis, and another ignis shall devor them; and ye shall know that I am the Dominus, when I set my facies against them.</p>
<p>8 And I will make the terram desolate, because they have committed scelus, saith the Dominus Deus.</p>
