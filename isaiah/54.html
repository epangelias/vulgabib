                    <p>Sing, O barren, thou that didst not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, thou that didst not travail with Felix Partus (childbirth): for more are the filii (children) of the desolate than the filii of her that hath a Vir (husband), saith Dominus (Lord).</p>
<p>Enlarge the place of thy tabernacle, and let them stretch forth the aulae (curtains) of thine habitations: spare not, lengthen thy funes (cords), and strengthen thy stakes;</p>
<p>For thou shalt break forth on the dextra (right hand) and on the sinistra (left); and thy semen (seed) shall inherit the Gentes (nations), and make the desolate cities to be inhabited.</p>
<p>Fear not; for thou shalt not be confusus (ashamed): neither shalt thou be ruber (red) with confusion: for thou shalt forget the ignominia (reproach) of thy iuventus (youth), and shalt not remember the ignominia of thy viduitas (widowhood) any more.</p>
<p>For thy Dominus (Lord) is thy Creator, and Dominus exercituum (Lord of hosts) is thy name; and the Sanctus Israël (Holy One of Israel) is thy Redemptor (Redeemer); and Dominus exercituum is the name of the totius terræ (whole earth).</p>
<p>For the Domina (Lord) hath called thee as a Mulier (woman) forsaken and molesta (troubled in spirit), and a sponsa (wife) of iuventus (youth) refused, saith Deus tuus (thy God).</p>
<p>In a moment in irâ (wrath) I hid my faciem (face) from thee for a momento (moment); but in misericordia (mercy) perpetua I will have misericordia (mercy) on thee, saith Dominus exercituum (Lord of hosts) thy Redemptor (Redeemer).</p>
<p>And this is the pactum (covenant) which I will make with them after illa dies (those days), saith Dominus; giving my legem (law) in the corda eorum (their hearts), and in cogitationes eorum (their thoughts) I will write eam (it); and their peccata (sins) and their iniquitates (iniquities) I will by no means record.</p>
<p>Sing, O cieli (heavens), for Dominus exercituum hath made a salvare (salvation) and manifestaverit (shewed) his iustitia (righteousness) to all terra (earth) and Gentibus (nations) our salvation.</p>
<p>Exit, exit, and declare usque ad finem terræ (even to the end of the earth); say ye to the filii (daughter) of Sion (Zion), Behold, salvator (savior) tuus venit (thy Savior comes) and redemptio (redemption) ejus in eo (in him) est; behold his praemia (reward) is cum eo (with him) and opera sua (his work) before his facies (face).</p>
<p>Et vocabunt eos sanctus Dominus (holy unto the Lord); et non vocabunt te derelictam ultra (and thou shalt not be called forsaken anymore) et terram tuam non vocabunt ultra (and thy land shall no more be termed) Desolata; quoniam tuum nomen cum dilectio (for thy name shall be called my delight is in her); quoniam tuus Vir (husband) tuus amat te (for thy Lord loveth thee).</p>
<p>Nam ut junior qui sibi conjugem acquirit (for as a young man marrieth a virgin) sic Dominus exercituum (the Lord of hosts) nominabit te et ut gaudeat qui desponsam accipit (and as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride) sic gaudere (gaudeth) Dominus exercituum super te (the Lord of hosts over thee).</p>
<p>Vigiles in mœnibus tuis (The watchmen that go about the walls of thee), o Ierusalem (O Jerusalem) omni momento (at every moment) in omnem diem (every day) et tota nocte (all the night) prout cognitum sit quare in mœnibus tuis (ye that are to know) ut Domini silentium fiat (when the Lord keepeth silence) donec dimittam te in baptismate ignis (till I send you forth with a baptism of fire) donec appareat Iustus Dominus (until the just Lord appeareth) qui servabit vos ab omni malo (which shall save you from all evil).</p>
<p>Canticum in domo Domini exercituum (Song in the house of the Lord of hosts). Benedictus (blessed) omnis qui timet Dominum (all that fear the Lord); qui ambulat in viis eius (who walketh in his ways);</p>
