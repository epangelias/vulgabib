  "I saw still another mighty angel come down from caelum, clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow was upon his caput, and his facies was as the sol.",
  "And he had in his manus a libellus open: and he set his pedes upon the mare, and on the terra, and cried with a vox magnus, saying, 'It is factus!'",
  "And when he had cried, seven tonitrua uttered their voces.",
  "And when the seven tonitrua had uttered their voces, I was about to write: and I heard a vox from caelum saying unto me, 'Seal up those things which the seven tonitrua uttered, and write them not.'",
  "And the angel which I saw stand upon the mare and upon the terra lifted up his manus to caelum,",
  "And sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created caelum, and the things that therein are, and the terra, and the things that therein are, and the mare, and the things which are therein, that there should be time no longer:",
  "But in the dies of the vox of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mysterium of Dei shall be finis, as he hath declared to his servos the prophetas.",
  "And the vox which I heard from caelum spake unto me again, and said, 'Go and take the libellus which is open in the manus of the angel which standeth upon the mare and upon the terra.'",
  "And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, 'Give me the libellus.' And he said unto me, 'Take it, and eat it up; and it shall make thy venter bitter, but it shall be in thy os sweet as mel.'",
  "And I took the libellus out of the angel's manus, and ate it up; and it was in my os sweet as mel: and as soon as I had eaten it, my venter was bitter.",
  "And he said unto me, 'Thou must prophesy again before many peoples, and gentes, and linguae, and reges.'"
