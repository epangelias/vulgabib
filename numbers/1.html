<p>50. Only thou shalt not take the numerus of the tribus of Levi, neither shalt thou put the sum of them among the filii of Israel:</p>
<p>51. But thou shalt appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of testimonium, and over all the vessels thereof, and over all things that belong to it: they shall bear the tabernacle, and all the vessels thereof; and they shall minister unto it, and shall encamp round about the tabernacle.</p>
<p>52. And when the tabernacle setteth forward, the Levites shall take it down: and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up: and the stranger that approacheth shall be put to death.</p>
<p>53. And the filii of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man by his own castra, and every man by his own signum, throughout their exercitus.</p>
<p>54. But the Levites shall pitch round about the tabernacle of testimonium, that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the filii of Israel: and the Levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of testimonium.</p>
<p>55. And the filii of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they.</p>
<p>56. And on the twentieth day of the secundus mensem, in the secundus year, the cloude was taken up from off the tabernacle of the congregation:</p>
<p>57. And the filii of Israel took their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai; and the cloude rested in the wilderness of Paran.</p>
<p>58. And there were certus prophetes among the Levites of the filii of Israel, which did prophesy, and spake unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto the congregation of the Levites, saying,</p>
<p>59. And Moses said unto them, If it be the will of the LORD, that ye go with us, and the LORD shall give us the terra which he hath promised to give us, then we will give you the terra among us, and ye shall be unto us as the filii of Israel:</p>
<p>60. But if the LORD do not give us the terra, then will we not give you the terra among us, for the LORD hath spoken unto us, saying, Ye shall not go over Jordan.</p>
<p>61. And they said unto him, We will go into the wilderness, and pitch our tents, and we will go before you, and prepare the way before you, and we will be unto you as the filii of Israel:</p>
<p>62. And Moses said unto them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will go armed before the LORD to war,</p>
<p>63. And will go all of you armed over Jordan before the LORD, until he hath driven out his inimicos from before him,</p>
<p>64. And the terra be subdued before the LORD: then afterward ye shall return, and be guiltless before the LORD, and before Israel; and this terra shall be your possession before the LORD.</p>
<p>65. But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against the LORD: and be sure your peccatum will find you out.</p>
<p>66. And they said, We will go up by the montes, and we will pitch our tents before them, and we will be unto you as the filii of Israel:</p>
<p>67. And Moses said unto them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will go up by the montes, and prepare the way before the LORD,</p>
<p>68. And will go up by the montes, and drive out the inimicos of the LORD from before him,</p>
<p>69. And the terra be subdued before the LORD; then afterward ye shall return, and be guiltless before the LORD, and before Israel; and this terra shall be your possession before the LORD.</p>
<p>70. But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against the LORD: and be sure your peccatum will find you out.</p>
<p>71. And the filii of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they.</p>
