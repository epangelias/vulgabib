                    <p>And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the terra.</p>
<p>And he taught them many things by parabolae, and said unto them in his doctrina:</p>
<p>Hearken; Behold, there went out a sator to sow:</p>
<p>And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the via, and the volucres of the caelum came and devoured it up.</p>
<p>And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much terra; and immediately it sprang up, because it had not profunditas of terra:</p>
<p>But when the sol was up, it was scorched; and because it had not radix, it withered away.</p>
<p>And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fructus.</p>
<p>And other fell on good terra, and did yield fructus that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, some sixty, some an hundred.</p>
<p>And he said unto them, He that hath aures to hear, let him hear.</p>
<p>And when he was alone, they that were about him with the duodecim asked of him the parabola.</p>
<p>And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mysterium of the regnum Dei: but unto them that are without, all these things are done in parabolis:</p>
<p>That seeing they may see, and not understand; and hearing they may hear, and not comprehend; lest at any time they should be converted, and their peccata should be forgiven them.</p>
<p>And he said unto them, Know ye not this parabola? and how then will ye know all parabolis?</p>
<p>The sator soweth the verbum.</p>
<p>And these are they by the via, where the verbum is sown; but when they have heard, Satan immediately cometh and taketh away the verbum that was sown in their corda.</p>
<p>And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the verbum, immediately receive it with gaudeo;</p>
<p>And have no radix in themselves, and so endure but for a tempus: afterward, when afflictio or persecutio ariseth for the verbum's sake, immediately they are scandalizati.</p>
<p>And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the verbum,</p>
