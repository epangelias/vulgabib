                    <p>1 O God, do not keep silence: hold not thy peace, and be not still, Deus meus, ne taceas.</p>
<p>2 For, behold, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have magnificus, lifted up their head.</p>
<p>3 They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones.</p>
<p>4 They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a gens: that the name of Israel may be no more in memoria.</p>
<p>5 For they have consulted together with one consent: they are in foedus against thee:</p>
<p>6 The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarenes;</p>
<p>7 Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre;</p>
<p>8 Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children of Lot. Selah.</p>
<p>9 Do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook of Kison:</p>
<p>10 Which perished at En-dor: they became as dung for the terra.</p>
<p>11 Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna:</p>
<p>12 Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of Deus in hereditas.</p>
<p>13 O my Deus, make them like aè½®: like the stubble before the facies.</p>
<p>14 As the flamma burneth a forest, and as the ignis setteth the mountains on smoke;</p>
<p>15 So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy procella.</p>
<p>16 Fill their facies with confusion: that they may seek thy nomine, O Deus.</p>
<p>17 Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish:</p>
<p>18 That men may know that thou, whose nomine alone is Jehova, art the Altissimus over all the terra.</p>
