  "Thus hath the Dominus Deus shewed unto me; and, behold, he formed locusts in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and, lo, it was the latter growth after the king's mowings.",
  "And it came to pass, that when they had made an end of eating the herbage of the terra, then I said, O Domine Deus, forgive, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he is small.",
  "The Domine Deus repented for this: It shall not be, saith the Domine Deus.",
  "Thus hath the Dominus Deus shewed unto me: and, behold, the Domine Deus called to contend by fire, and it devoured the great abyss: and would have eaten up the inheritance of Jacob.",
  "Then said I, O Domine Deus, cease, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he is small.",
  "The Domine Deus repented for this: This also shall not be, saith the Domine Deus.",
  "Thus he shewed me: and, behold, the Domine Deus stood upon a wall made by plumb-line, with a plumb-line in his hand.",
  "And the Domine Deus said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A plumb-line. Then said the Domine Deus, Behold, I will set a plumb-line in the midst of my people Israel: I will not again pass by them any more:",
  "And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the gladius.",
  "Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the terra is not able to bear all his words.",
  "For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the gladius, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own terra.",
  "Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou vates, flee thee away into the terra of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there:",
  "But prophesy not again any more at Bethel: for it is the king's sanctuarium, and it is the regia domus.",
  "Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, neither was I a son of a prophet; but I was an armentarius, and a gatherer of sycomori.",
  "And the Domine Deus took me as he found me, and went, and said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.",
  "Now therefore hear thou the word of the Domine Deus: Thou sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not thy word against the house of Isaac.",
  "Therefore thus saith the Domine Deus; Thy uxor shall be an meretrix in the urbs, and thy filii and thy filiae shall fall by the gladius, and thy terra shall be divided by the funiculus.",
  "And thou shalt die in terra impia, and Israel shall surely go into captivitas forth of his own terra."
