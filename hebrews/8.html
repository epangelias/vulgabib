                    <p>I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee. Fear thou not, for I am with thee: and be not dismayed, for I am thy Deus.</p>
<p>I will also be thy Deus, and thou shalt be my populus: for by my virtus, thou hast gotten the victoria.</p>
<p>When Deus made a testament for the people, when He slew them in the wilderness, yet they obeyed not; but turned back, and tempted Deus, and limited the Sanctus Spiritus.</p>
<p>For they provoked Him to anger with their actibus, and tempted Deus in their corde.</p>
<p>And He said, They shall not enter into my requies, because they have tempted me, and have not believed my opera.</p>
<p>For forty years I was grieved with this generatio, and said, It is a people that do err in their corde, and they have not known my viae.</p>
<p>I said, They shall not enter into my requies, as I have sworn in my ira, if they shall enter into my requies, though they had seen my opera.</p>
<p>For the Deus of the spiritus is not the Deus of the dead, but of the vivi.</p>
<p>Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an pontifex, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Maiestas in the caelis;</p>
<p>A Minister of the Sanctus, and of the verus Tabernaculum, which the Deus pitched, and not man.</p>
<p>For every pontifex is ordained to offer giftas and sacrificia: wherefore it is of necessity that this pontifex also must have somewhat to offer.</p>
<p>For if he were on earth, he would not be a pontifex, seeing that there are pontifices that offer giftas according to the lex;</p>
<p>Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of Deus when he was about to make the Tabernaculum: for, See, saith He, that thou make all things according to the exemplar shewed to thee in the monte.</p>
<p>But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministerium, by how much also he is the Mediator of a better testament, which was established upon better promissae.</p>
