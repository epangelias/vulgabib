                    <p>Then Job answered and said, I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are ye all.</p>
<p>Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest?</p>
<p>I also could speak as ye do: if your soul were in my soul's stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head at you.</p>
<p>But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should asswage your grief.</p>
<p>These things hast thou said, and wouldst thou have me to speak? yet wouldst thou make me to hold my tongue, and wouldst not let me to be silent?</p>
<p>Yea, if I speak, my grief is not assuaged: and if I forbear, what am I eased?</p>
<p>But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company.</p>
<p>And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, which is a witness against me: and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face.</p>
<p>He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.</p>
<p>They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me.</p>
<p>God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked.</p>
<p>I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark.</p>
<p>His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground.</p>
<p>He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like a giant.</p>
<p>I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust.</p>
<p>My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids is the shadow of death;</p>
<p>Not for any injustice in mine hands: also my prayer is pure.</p>
<p>O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no resting place.</p>
<p>Also now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and my record is on high.</p>
<p>My friends scorn me: but mine eye poureth out tears unto God.</p>
<p>O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth for his neighbour!</p>
<p>For when a few years are come, then I shall go the way whence I shall not return.</p>
<p>My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves are ready for me.</p>
<p>Are there not mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue in their provocation?</p>
<p>Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee; who is he that will strike hands with me?</p>
<p>For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore shalt thou not exalt them.</p>
<p>He that speaketh flattery to his friends, even the eyes of his children shall fail.</p>
<p>He hath made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I was as a tabret.</p>
<p>Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members are as a shadow.</p>
<p>Upright men shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite.</p>
<p>The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.</p>
