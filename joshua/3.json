  "And Joshua rose early in the matutine, and they removed from Shittim, and came to Jordan, he and all the filii of Israel, and lodged there before they passed over.",
  "And it came to pass after tres dies, that the officers went through the castrum,",
  "And they commanded the populus, saying, When ye see the ark of the covenant of the Dominus your Deus, and the sacerdotes and the Levites bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go after it.",
  "Yet there shall be a spatium between you and it, about duo milia cubits by mensura: come not near unto it, that ye may know the way by which ye must go: for ye have not passed this way heretofore.",
  "And Joshua said unto the populus, Sanctify yourselves: for tomorrow the Dominus will do wonders among you.",
  "And Joshua spake unto the sacerdotes, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the populus. And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the populus.",
  "And the Dominus said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee.",
