                    <p>Joash was seven years old when he began to regnare, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem: but his mater was Zibiah of Beersheba.</p>
<p>And Joash did that which was rectus in the sight of the Dominus all the days of Jehoiada the sacerdos.</p>
<p>And Jehoiada took for him two uxores, and he begat filii and filiae.</p>
<p>And it came to pass after this, that Joash was minded to renovate the domus of the Dominus.</p>
<p>And he gathered together the sacerdotes and the Levites, and said to them, Go out unto the civitates of Judah, and gather of all Israel money to repair the domus of your Deus from anno to year, and see that ye hasten the matter, but the Levites did not hasten it.</p>
<p>And the rex called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him, Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and Jerusalem the tribute of Moses the servus of the Dominus, and of the congregation of Israel, for the tabernaculum of testimonium?</p>
<p>For the filii of Athaliah, that wicked uxor, had broken up the domus of Deus; and also all the res dedicated to the domus of the Dominus did they bestow upon the Baalim.</p>
<p>And at the rex's mandatum they made a cista, and put it without at the porta of the domus of the Dominus.</p>
<p>And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in to the Dominus the tribute of Moses the servus of Deus, and of the congregation of Israel, for the tabernaculum of testimonium.</p>
<p>And all the principes and all the populus rejoiced, and they brought in, and cast into the cista, until they had made an end.</p>
<p>Now it came to pass, that at what time the cista was brought unto the officiales of the rex by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much pecunia, the scriba and the officer of the rex came and emptied the cista, and carried it to his place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance.</p>
<p>And the rex and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the ministerium of the domus of the Dominus, and hired masons and carpenters to repair the domus of the Dominus, and also such as wrought ferrum and aes to mend the domus of the Dominus.</p>
<p>So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them, and they set the domus of Deus in statu suo: and strengthened it.</p>
<p>And when they had finished it, they brought the rest of the pecunia before the rex and Jehoiada, whereof were made vasa for the domus of the Dominus, even vasa to ministrare, and to offer holocausts, censers also and vasa aurea and argentea. And they offered holocausts in the domus of the Dominus continually all the days of Jehoiada.</p>
<p>But Jehoiada grew old, and was full of dies; and he died; he was an hundred and thirty years old when he died.</p>
<p>And they buried him in the Civitas of David among the reges, because he had done good in Israel, both toward Deus, and toward his domus.</p>
<p>Now after the mors of Jehoiada came the principes of Judah, and made obeisance to the rex. Then the rex hearkened unto them.</p>
<p>And they left the domus of the Dominus Deus of their patres, and served the luci and the idols: and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their transgressio.</p>
<p>Therefore he sent prophetas to them, to bring them again unto the Dominus; and they testified against them: but they would not give ear.</p>
<p>And the Spirit of Deus came upon Zechariah the filius of Jehoiada the sacerdos: which stood above the populus, and said unto them, Thus saith Deus, Why transgress ye the mandata of the Dominus, that ye cannot prosper? because ye have forsaken the Dominus, he hath also forsaken you.</p>
<p>And they conspired against him, and stoned him with lapides at the mandatum of the rex in the atrium of the domus of the Dominus.</p>
<p>Thus Joash the rex remembered not the benignitas which Jehoiada his pater had done to him, but slew his filius. And when he died, he said, The Dominus see it, and require it.</p>
<p>And it came to pass at the end of the year, that the host of Syria came up against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the principes of the populus from among the populus, and sent all the spoile of them unto the rex of Damascus.</p>
<p>For the host of the Syria came with a small company of men, and the Dominus delivered a very great host into their hand, because they had forsaken the Dominus Deus of their patres. So they executed judiciums against Joash.</p>
<p>And it came to pass, as the host departed from him, that he was left in magnis doloribus. And his own servientes conspired against him for the sanguinem of the filii of Jehoiada the sacerdos, and slew him in his lectus, and he died: and they buried him in the Civitas of David, but they buried him not in the sepulchra of the reges.</p>
<p>And these are they that conspired against him; Zabad the filius of Shimeath an Ammonite, and Jehozabad the filius of Shimrith a Moabite.</p>
<p>Now concerning his filii, and the multitude of his orationes, and the reparatio of the domus of Deus, behold, they are written in the commentarius of the book of the reges. And Amaziah his filius reigned in his stead.</p>
