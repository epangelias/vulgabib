                    <p>And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of the domus Dei, and the regia, and all Solomon's desiderium, which he was pleased to do,</p>
<p>That the Lord appeared to Solomon the secundum, as he had appeared unto him at Gibeon.</p>
<p>And the Lord said unto Solomon, Because thy cor has been as this, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the vita of thine enemies, neither yet hast asked long vita; but hast asked sapientia and scientia for thyself, that thou mayest iudicare my people, over whom I have made thee rex:</p>
<p>Wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee; and I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honour, such as none of the reges have had that have been before thee, neither shall there any after thee have the like.</p>
<p>But if thou turn away, or forsake my statuta and my iudicia, which I have set before thee, and shalt go and serve other deos, and worship them:</p>
<p>I will pluck them out of my terra which I have given them; and this domus, which I have sanctified for my nomen, will I cast out of my sight, and will make it to be a proverb and a fable among all nations.</p>
<p>And this domus, which is high, shall be an astonishment to every one that passeth by it; so that he shall say, Why hath the Lord done thus unto this terra, and unto this domus?</p>
<p>And it shall be answered, Because they forsook the Lord their Deus, who brought forth their patres out of Aegypto, and laid hold on other deos, and worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath he brought all this malum upon them.</p>
<p>And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein Solomon had built the two domus, the domus of the Lord and the regia,</p>
<p>That the urbs, which Huram the rex of Tyre had restored to Solomon, Solomon built it, and caused the filios Israel to dwell there.</p>
<p>And Solomon went to Hamath-zobah, and prevailed against it.</p>
<p>And he built Tadmor in the desert, and all the urbes of store, which he built in Hamath.</p>
<p>Also he built Beth-horon the upper, and Beth-horon the lower, urbes of munition, with walls, portas, and bars;</p>
<p>And Baalath, and all the urbes of store, that Solomon had, and all the urbes of the currus, and the urbes of the equites, and all that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and throughout all the terra of his dominion.</p>
<p>As for all the people that were left of the Amorrei, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which were not of the filios Israel;</p>
<p>Their filios that were left after them in the terra, whom the filios Israel also were not able utterly to destroy, upon those did Solomon lay a tributum of servitium unto this day.</p>
<p>But of the filios Israel did Solomon make no servos for his opus; for they were homines of bellum, and his principes, and his duces, and his equites, and his currus.</p>
<p>And these were the principes of Solomon, even two hundred and fifty, that bare rule over the people.</p>
<p>And Solomon brought up the filia of Pharaoh out of the urbs of David unto the domus that he had built for her: for he said, My uxor shall not dwell in the domus of David rex of Israel, because the places are sancti, into which the arca of the Lord hath come.</p>
<p>Then Solomon offered burnt oblationes unto the Lord on the altare of the Lord, which he had built before the porticus;</p>
<p>Even after a certain rate every die, offering according to the commandment of Moses, on the sabbata, and on the new luna, and on the three festa of the year, that is, in the festa of the unleavened panis, and in the festa of weeks, and in the festa of tabernacula.</p>
<p>And he appointed, according to the ordinem of David his pater, the courses of the sacerdotes to their ministerium, and the Levites to their ordines, to praise and minister before the sacerdotes, as the ritus of every die:</p>
<p>The porters also, by their ordines at every porta; for so was the commandment of David the rex.</p>
<p>And they departed not from the commandment of the rex unto the sacerdotes and Levites concerning any materia, or concerning the thesauri.</p>
<p>Now all the opus of Solomon was prepared from the die that he began to build the domus of the Lord, and until it was finished. So the domus of the Lord was perfected.</p>
<p>And Solomon went to Ezion-geber, and to Eloth, at the mouth of the mare, in the terra of Edom.</p>
<p>And Huram sent him by the manÅ«s of his servos naviculas, and servos that had scientia of the mare; and they went with the servos of Solomon to Ophir, and took thence four hundred and fifty talents of aurum, and brought them to the rex Solomon.</p>
