  "Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red mare, as the Lord spake unto me: and we compassed mount Seir many dies.",
  "And the Lord spake unto me, saying, Ye have compassed this mount long enough: turn you northward.",
  "And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the costra of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and they shall be in sollicitudo for you: but take ye good heed to yourselves;",
  "Contend not with them; for I will not give you of their terra, no, not so much as a pes.",
  "For I have given mount Seir unto Esau for a possessio.",
  "Ye shall buy victuals of them with pecunia: ye shall eat; and thou shalt also buy water of them with pecunia: ye shalt drink.",
  "For the Lord thy God hath blessed thee in all the opera of thy manus: he knoweth thy walking through this grande wilderness: these forty anni the Lord thy God hath been with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.",
  "And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the valle, from Elath, and from Eziongaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.",
  "And the Lord said unto me, Disturb not the Moabites, neither contend with them in guerra: for I will not give thee of their terra for a possessio; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a possessio.",
  "The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims;",
  "Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites call them Emims.",
  "The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the terra of his possessio, which the Lord gave unto them.",
  "Now rise up, said I, and get you over the torrent Arnon: behold, I have given into thine manus Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his terra: begin to possess it, and contend with him in guerra.",
  "This day will I begin to put the timor of thee and the formido of thee upon the faces of the people under the whole caelum, who shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in angustia because of thee.",
  "And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of pacem, saying,",
  "Let me pass through thy terra: I will go along by the way, I will not turn unto the right hand nor to the left.",
  "Thou shalt sell me victuals for pecunia, that I may eat; and give me water for pecunia, that I may drink: I will only, without doing any thing else, pass through on my pedes;",
  "As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which dwell in Ar, did unto me; until I shall pass over the Jordan into the terra which the Lord our God giveth us.",
  "But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the Lord thy God hardened his spirit, and made his cor obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy manus, as appeareth this day.",
  "And the Lord said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his terra before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his terra.",
  "Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz.",
  "And the Lord our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his filii, and all his people.",
  "And we took all his urbes at that time, and utterly destroyed the homines, and the mulieres, and the parvuli, of every civitas, we left none to remain:",
  "Only the jumenta we took for ourselves, the spoil of the urbes which we took.",
  "From Aroer, which is by the ripa of the torrent Arnon, and from the civitas that is by the torrent, even unto Gilead, there was not one urbs too forte for us: the Lord our God delivered all unto us:",
  "Only unto the terra of the filii of Ammon thou camest not, nor unto any place of the torrent Jabbok, nor unto the urbes in the montes, nor unto whatsoever the Lord our God forbad us."
