  "Then Jonah prayed unto the LORD his Deus out of the fish's belly,",
  "And said, I cried by reason of mine afflictio unto the LORD, and he heard me; out of the belly of gehenna cried I, and thou heardest my vox.",
  "For thou hadst cast me into the profundum, in the midst of the mare, and the flumen compassed me about: all thy billows and thy waves passed over me.",
  "Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again toward thy sanctuarium.",
  "The aquae compassed me about, even to the anima: the profundum closed me round about, the alga was wrapped round my caput.",
  "I went down to the fundamenta of the montes; the terra with her bars was about me for ever: yet hast thou brought up my vita from corruption, O LORD my Deus.",
  "When my anima fainted within me I remembered the LORD: and my prayer came in unto thee, into thine aulam sanctuaria.",
  "They that observe vanitates and lying vanitates, forsake their own misericordia.",
  "But I will sacrifice unto thee with the vox of laudis; I will pay that that I have vowed. Salvation is of the LORD.",
  "And the LORD spake unto the piscis, and it vomited out Jonah upon the terra."
