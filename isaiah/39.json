  "At that time Merodach-baladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah: for he had heard that he had been sick, and was recovered.",
  "And Hezekiah was glad of them, and showed them the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and all the house of his armour, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah showed them not.",
  "Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? And Hezekiah said, They came from a far rex, from Babylon.",
  "And he said, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezekiah answered, All the things that are in mine house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not showed them.",
  "And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah, Hear the word of Dominus, of hosts: ",
  "Behold, the dies come, that all that is in thine house, and that which thy patres have laid up in store until this day, shall be carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith Dominus.",
  "And of thy filii that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchi in the palace of the king of Babylon.",
  "Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, Good is the word of Dominus which thou hast spoken. And he said, Is it not good, if pacem and veritas be in my dies?",
  "And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how he made a piscina, and a canal, and brought aqua into the civitas, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?"
