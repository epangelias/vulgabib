  "And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph, Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.",
  "And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.",
  "And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,",
  "And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.",
  "And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Aegyptum, before I came unto thee into Aegyptum, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.",
  "And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.",
  "And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is Bethlehem.",
  "And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?",
  "And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom Deus hath given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will benedicere them.",
  "Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.",
  "And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, Deus hath shewed me also thy semen.",
  "And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.",
  "And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him.",
  "And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's caput, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's caput, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn.",
  "And he blessed them, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, Deus make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.",
  "And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but Deus shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your patres.",
  "Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my gladius and with my arcus.",
  "And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his pedes into the bed, and expired, and was gathered unto his populus."
