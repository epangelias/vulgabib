                    <p>Him that is weak in the fides, receive ye, but not to disputations of reasonings.</p>
<p>For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is infirmus, eateth herbs.</p>
<p>Let not him that eateth, despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not, judicare him that eateth: for Deus hath received him.</p>
<p>Who art thou that judicest another man's servus? to his own dominus he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be made to stand; for Deus is able to make him stand.</p>
<p>One man esteemeth one dies above another: another esteemeth every dies alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mens.</p>
<p>He that observeth the dies, observeth it unto the Dominus; and he that observeth not the dies, to the Dominus he doth not observare it. He that eateth, eateth to the Dominus, for he giveth gratias to Deus; and he that eateth not, to the Dominus he eateth not, and giveth gratias to Deus.</p>
<p>For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.</p>
<p>For whether we live, we live unto the Dominus; and whether we die, we die unto the Dominus: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Domini.</p>
<p>For to this end Christus died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Dominus both of the vivus and mortuus.</p>
<p>But why dost thou judicare thy brother? or why dost thou despise thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judicium seat of Christus.</p>
<p>For it is written, As I live, saith the Dominus, every genu shall bow to me, and every lingua shall confess to Deus.</p>
<p>So then every one of us shall give account of himself to Deus.</p>
<p>Let us not therefore judicare one another any more: but rather this put in your mens, that no man put an offendiculum or scandalum in his brother's way.</p>
<p>I know, and am persuaded by the Dominus Iesus, that there is nothing commune of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be commune, to him it is commune.</p>
<p>But if thy brother be grieved with thy cibus, now walkest thou not charititer. Destroy not him with thy cibus, for whom Christus died.</p>
<p>Let not then your good be evil spoken of:</p>
<p>For the regnum of Deus is not cibus and potus; but justitia, and pax, and gaudium in the Holy Spiritus.</p>
<p>For he that in these things servit Christo, is acceptable to Deus, and approved of men.</p>
<p>Let us therefore follow after the things which make for pacem, and things wherewith one may edificare another.</p>
<p>Destroy not the opus of Deus for cibus. All things indeed are munda; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offendiculum.</p>
<p>It is good neither to eat cibus, nor to drink vinum, nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.</p>
<p>Hast thou fides? have it to thyself before Deus. Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.</p>
<p>And he that doubteth is damned if he eateth, because he eateth not of fides: for whatsoever is not of fides is peccatum.</p>
