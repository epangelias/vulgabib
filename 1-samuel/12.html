                    <p>And Samuel spake unto the populus of Israel, saying, 'The Dominus hath anointed me to be iudex over you this day:</p>
<p>When I was a iuvenis, though I was magnus in anno among you, I walked before you from my iuventus unto this day:</p>
<p>Behold, here I am: testimonium against me before the Dominus and before His unigenitus, whose pecus I have taken, whose agrum I have tilled, whose vineam I have planted:</p>
<p>Whose argentum or aurum I have taken of any of you, and whose filius or filiam I have taken to make eunuchos for me, that I might augere my substantia:</p>
<p>Testor against me this day before the Dominus and before His unigenitus, that I have not taken pecus, nor agrum, nor vineam, nor argentum, nor aurum of any of you, neither have I taken filium or filiam of any of you to make eunuchos for me:</p>
<p>And they said, Thou hast not taken pecus, nor agrum, nor vineam, nor argentum, nor aurum of us, neither hast thou taken filium or filiam of us to make eunuchos for thee:</p>
<p>And Samuel said unto the populus, The Dominus, who anointed me iudex over you, is testis against you this day, that you have not found manus in me.</p>
<p>And they said, He is testis.</p>
<p>And Samuel said unto the populus, This is the verbum of the Dominus, who anointed Saul to be rex over His populus Israel:</p>
<p>Now therefore hearken unto the vox of the Dominus, and observe the praecepta of the Dominus your Deus, and serve Him with totum corde, and with tota anima:</p>
<p>For ascoltare the vox of the Dominus, and to keep the praecepta of the Dominus, is the vita of your anima:</p>
<p>But if you ascoltare not the vox of the Dominus, but peccare against the Dominus, then shall the manus of the Dominus be against you, and against your rex:</p>
<p>Is it not autumno that the messis of triticum is? And have we called unto the Dominus upon you in vain? No, but you have peccare, and the Dominus hath sent the pluvia upon you:</p>
<p>And now, behold, the Dominus hath sent the pluvia upon you, and it is autumno, the messis of triticum, and you have peccare against the Dominus, and have not ascoltare the vox of the Dominus:</p>
<p>Therefore the Dominus hath sent the pluvia upon you, and it is autumno, the messis of triticum, and you have peccare against the Dominus:</p>
<p>And Samuel clamavit unto the Dominus, and the Dominus sent tonitrus and pluvia that die, and all the populus magnopere timuit Dominum and Samuel:</p>
<p>And all the populus dixit unto Samuel, Oramus te, peccare nos peccavimus, ascolta pro nobis ad Dominum Deus tuus, ne moriamur.</p>
<p>And Samuel dixit ad populum, Ne timueritis, you have peccare, but nunc ascoltare the vox of the Dominus, and serve Him with totum corde, and with tota anima:</p>
<p>Nolite recedere a Domino, sed servite Domino cum totum corde, et cum tota anima:</p>
<p>Nolite sequi vanitates, quae non prosunt vobis, neque liberabunt vos, quia vanitates sunt:</p>
<p>Nam Dominus non derelinquet populum suum propter nomen suum magnum, quia Dominus coepit vos vocare populum suum:</p>
<p>Sed ego oro ne peccare, neque derelinquatis Dominum, qui est cum vobis, et cum patribus vestris, et cum universo populo vestro, a diebus antiquis usque in diem hanc:</p>
<p>Nunc ergo ne derelinquatis Dominum, sed servite Domino cum timore, et cum veritate, et cum totum corde, et cum tota anima:</p>
<p>Et videte quae magna opera fecit Dominus inter vos, et cum universo Israel, a diebus antiquis usque in diem hanc, et cum patribus vestris:</p>
<p>Et nunc ne derelinquatis Dominum, sed servite Domino cum timore, et cum veritate, et cum totum corde, et cum tota anima:</p>
<p>Si autem nolueritis ascoltare the vox of the Dominus, et peccare against the Dominus, then shall the manus of the Dominus be against you, and against your rex:</p>
<p>But if you ascoltare the vox of the Dominus, and keep the praecepta of the Dominus, then shall the Dominus be with you, and with your rex:</p>
