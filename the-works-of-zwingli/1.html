                    <p>In principio, God created the caelum and the terra.</p>
<p>And the terra was without forma, and void; and tenebrae was upon the facies of the profundum. And the Spiritus of God moved upon the facies of the aquae.</p>
<p>The Spiritus of God moved upon the facies of the aquae. And God said, Fiat lux; and there was lux.</p>
<p>And God saw the lux, that it was bonum: and God divided the lux from the tenebrae.</p>
<p>And God called the lux Dies, and the tenebrae he called Nox. And there was vespere, and there was mane: dies unus.</p>
<p>And God said, Fiat firmamentum in medio aquarum, and let it divide the aquae from the aquae.</p>
<p>And God made the firmamentum, and divided the aquae which were subter from the aquae which were super.</p>
<p>And God called the firmamentum Caelum. And there was vespere, and there was mane: dies secundus.</p>
<p>And God said, Congregentur aquae quae subter caelum sunt in locum unum, and let the terra appear.</p>
<p>And it was so. And God called the terra Terram, and the congregations of aquae he called Maria.</p>
<p>And God saw that it was bonum.</p>
<p>And God said, Germinet terra herbam virentem, and faciens semen, and lignum pomiferum faciens fructum iuxta genus suum, cuius semen in semetipso sit super terram.</p>
<p>And it was so.</p>
<p>And the terra produxit herbam virentem, and lignum faciens semen iuxta genus suum, and lignum pomiferum faciens fructum, et habens semen secundum genus suum super terram.</p>
<p>And God saw that it was bonum.</p>
<p>And there was vespere, and there was mane: dies tertius.</p>
<p>And God said, Fiant luminaria in firmamento caeli, and let them be for signa, and for tempora, and for dies, and anni.</p>
<p>And let them be for luminaria in firmamento caeli, and let them shine super terram.</p>
<p>And it was so.</p>
<p>And God made duo luminaria majora: luminaria maius, ut praeesset diei, and luminaria minus, ut praeesset nocti: et fecit stellas.</p>
<p>And God posuit ea in firmamento caeli, ut lucerent super terram,</p>
<p>And ut praeessent diei, et nocti, and to divide the lucem from the tenebris.</p>
<p>And God saw that it was bonum.</p>
<p>And there was vespere, and there was mane: dies quartus.</p>
