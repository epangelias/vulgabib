  "This know also, that in the last dies, perilous tempora shall come.",
  "For men shall be lovers of their own personas, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,",
  "Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,",
  "Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of Deus,",
  "Having a form of pietas, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.",
  "For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly mulieres laden with sins, led away with divers desideria,",
  "Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of veritas.",
  "Now as Jannes and Jambres resisted Moyses, so do these also resist the veritas: men of corrupted minds, reprobate concerning the fides:",
  "But they shall proceed no further: for their stultitia shall be manifest unto all men, as theirs also was.",
  "But thou hast fully known my doctrina, manner of life, purpose, fides, longsuffering, charity, patience,",
  "Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of them all the Dominus delivered me.",
  "Yea, and all that will live godly in Christo Jesus shall suffer persecutio.",
  "But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.",
  "But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them;",
  "And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through fides which is in Christo Jesus.",
  "All scripture is given by inspiratio of Deus, and is profitable for doctrina, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in justitia:",
  "That the man of Deus may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all bonne opera."
