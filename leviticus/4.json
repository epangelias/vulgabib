  "1 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 2 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin through ignorance against the sancta of the Lord, and shall do some of those things which are forbidden to be done against the sancta of the Lord; though he wot it not, yet is he culpabilis, and shall bear his iniquitas.",
  "3 Or if his peccatum, wherein he hath sinned, come to his notitia; he shall bring his oblatio unto the Lord for his peccatum, which he hath sinned, a young female capra for a peccatum: he shall bring it to the ostium of the tabernaculum of the congregation.",
  "4 And he shall put his manus upon the caput of the sin offering, and slay the sin offering in the locum of the holocaust.",
  "5 And the sacerdos shall take of the sanguis of the sin offering with his finger, and put it upon the cornua of the altare of the holocaust, and shall pour out all the sanguis thereof at the base of the altare.",
  "6 And he shall eximius the fat from it, and burn it upon the altare.",
  "7 And he shall do with the sin offering, as he did with the sin offering for the peccatum of the pontifex, so shall he do with it: and the sacerdos shall expiare for him, and it shall be forgiven him.",
  "8 And he shall take all the adipem that covereth the intestina, and the caul above the iecur, and the two renes, and the adipem that is upon them, and burn them upon the altare.",
  "9 But the pellis of the sin offering, and all the carnem, with the caput, and the crura, and the intestina, and the fimum,",
  "10 Even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the castra unto a clean locum, where the cineres are poured out, and burn him on the ligna with ignis: without the castra shall he be burnt.",
  "11 And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance, and a res be hid from the oculi of the congregation, and they have done somewhat against any of the praecepta of the Lord concerning things which should not be done, and are culpabilis;",
  "12 When the peccatum, which they have sinned against it, is made known, then the congregation shall offer a young bullock for the peccatum, and bring him before the tabernaculum of the congregation.",
  "13 And the seniores of the congregation shall put their manus upon the caput of the bullock before the Lord: and the bullock shall be slain before the Lord.",
  "14 And the sacerdos that is anointed shall take of the sanguis of the bullock, and bring it to the tabernaculum of the congregation:",
  "15 And the sacerdos shall dip his finger in some of the sanguis, and sprinkle it seven times before the Lord, before the velum of the sanctuarium.",
  "16 And he shall put some of the sanguis upon the cornua of the altare which is before the Lord, that is in the tabernaculum of the congregation, and shall pour out all the sanguis at the base of the altare of the holocaust, which is at the ostium of the tabernaculum of the congregation.",
  "17 And he shall take all the adipem from him, and burn it upon the altare.",
  "18 And he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock for a peccatum, so shall he do with this: and the sacerdos shall expiare for them, and it shall be forgiven them.",
  "19 And he shall take the bullock without the castra, and burn him as he burned the first bullock: it is a sin offering for the congregation.",
  "20 When a dux hath sinned, and through ignorance hath done somewhat against any of the praecepta of the Lord his Deus, concerning things which should not be done, and is culpabilis;",
  "21 Or if his peccatum, wherein he hath sinned, come to his notitia; he shall bring his oblatio, a capra of the goats, a male without blemish:",
  "22 And he shall put his manus upon the caput of the goat, and slay it in the locum where they kill the holocaust before the Lord: it is a sin offering.",
  "23 And the sacerdos shall take of the sanguis of the sin offering with his finger, and put it upon the cornua of the altare of the holocaust, and shall pour out all the sanguis thereof at the base of the altare:",
  "24 And he shall burn all the adipem upon the altare, as the adipem of the sacrifice of pacificum: and the sacerdos shall expiare for him as concerning his peccatum, and it shall be forgiven him.",
  "25 And if any one of the plebs sin through ignorance, while he doth somewhat against any of the praecepta of the Lord concerning things which should not be done, and is culpabilis;",
  "26 Or if his peccatum, which he hath sinned, come to his notitia: then he shall bring his oblatio, a capra of the goats, a female without blemish, for his peccatum which he hath sinned.",
  "27 And he shall lay his manus upon the caput of the sin offering, and slay the sin offering in the locum of the holocaust:",
  "28 And the sacerdos shall take of the sanguis thereof with his finger, and put it upon the cornua of the altare of the holocaust, and shall pour out all the sanguis thereof at the base of the altare:",
  "29 And he shall take all the adipem thereof, as the adipem is taken off the sacrifice of pacificum; and the sacerdos shall burn it upon the altare for a sweet odorem unto the Lord; and the sacerdos shall expiare for him, and it shall be forgiven him.",
  "30 And if he bring a sheep, then he shall bring it a female without blemish.",
  "31 And he shall lay his manus upon the caput of the sin offering, and slay it for a sin offering in the locum where they kill the holocaust:",
  "32 And the sacerdos shall take of the sanguis thereof with his finger, and put it upon the cornua of the altare of the holocaust, and pour out all the sanguis thereof at the base of the altare:",
  "33 And he shall take away the adipem thereof, as the adipem of the sheep is taken away from the sacrifice of pacificum; and the sacerdos shall burn them upon the altare, according to the offerings made by fire unto the Lord; and the sacerdos shall expiare for him as concerning his peccatum."
