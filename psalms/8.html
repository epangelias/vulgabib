                    <p>O Domine, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the terra!</p>
<p>Out of the mouth of infantes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.</p>
<p>When I consider the caelum, the work of thy fingers, the lunam and the stellae, which thou hast ordained;</p>
<p>What is homo, that thou art mindful of him? and the filius hominis, that thou visitest him?</p>
<p>For thou hast made him a little lower than the angelos, and hast crowned him with gloria and honorem.</p>
<p>Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy manus: thou hast put all things under his pedes:</p>
<p>Ovine and all beastes of the terra, also the volucres of the caelum, and the pisces of the mare;</p>
<p>O Domine, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the terra!</p>
