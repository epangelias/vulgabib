                    <p>And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an official of Pharaoh, captain of the custodes, an Egyptian, bought him out of the hands of the Ishmaelites, who had brought him down thither.</p>
<p>And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperus man; and he was in the house of his dominus the Egyptian.</p>
<p>And his dominus saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his manÅ«s.</p>
<p>And Joseph found gratia in his sight, and he served him: and he made him the minister of his domus, and put all that he had in his manus.</p>
<p>And it came to pass from the time that he had made him minister of his domus, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian's domus for Joseph's sake; and the benedictio of the LORD was upon all that he had in the domus, and in the ager.</p>
<p>And he left all that he had in Joseph's manus; and he knew not ought he had, save the panem which he did eat. And Joseph was formosus and decorus in aspectu.</p>
<p>And it came to pass after these things, that his dominus's uxor cast her oculus upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.</p>
<p>But he refused, and said unto his dominus's uxor, Behold, my dominus wotteth not what is with me in the domus, and he hath committed all that he hath to my manus;</p>
<p>There is none greater in this domus than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his uxor: how then can I do this magnum scelus, and peccare against God?</p>
<p>And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her.</p>
<p>And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the domus to do his officium; and there was none of the homines of the domus there within.</p>
<p>And she caught him by his vestimentum, saying, Lie with me: and he left his vestimentum in her manus, and fled, and ran out.</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his vestimentum in her manus, and was fled out, that she called unto the homines of the domus, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebraeus unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud vox;</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when I lifted up my vox and cried, that he left his vestimentum with me, and fled out.</p>
<p>And she laid up his vestimentum by her, until his dominus came domum.</p>
<p>And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebraeus servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me:</p>
<p>And it came to pass, as I lifted up my vox and cried, that he left his vestimentum with me, and fled out.</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when his dominus heard the words of his uxor, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant unto me; that his ire was kindled.</p>
<p>And Joseph's dominus took him, and put him into the carcer, a place where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was there in the carcer.</p>
<p>But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him misericordiam, and gave him gratia in the sight of the keeper of the carcer.</p>
<p>And the keeper of the carcer committed to Joseph's manus all the prisoners that were in the carcer; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it.</p>
<p>The keeper of the carcer looked not to any thing that was under his manus; because the LORD was with him, and that which he did, the LORD made it prosper.</p>
