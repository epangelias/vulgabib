  "It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelatios.",
  "I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in corpus, I know not: or whether out of corpus, I know not, Deus scit) such an one caught up to tertius caelum.",
  "And I knew such a man, (whether in corpus, or out of corpus, I know not: Deus scit)",
  "How that he was caught up into paradisus, and heard arcana verba, which it is not licit for hominem to loqui.",
  "Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in infirmitatibus meae.",
  "For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be insipiens: for I say the veritas: but now I forbear, lest any man should put me above id, quod in me videt, aut quod in me audit.",
  "And lest I should be exaltatus above mensuram, per abundantiam revelationum, there was given me a stimulus carnis, angelus Satanae, qui me colaphizaret.",
  "For which thing I besought Dominum ter, that it might depart from me.",
  "And he said unto me, Gratia mea te sufficit: nam virtus in infirmitate perficitur. Itaque libenter gloriabor in infirmitatibus meis, ut inhabitet in me virtus Christi.",
  "Wherefore I take pleasure in infirmitatibus, in contumeliis, in necessitatibus, in persecutionibus, in angustiis, pro Christo: for when I am infirmus, then I am fortis.",
  "I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nihil I was inferior to summi Apostoli, though I be nihil.",
  "Truly the signa Apostolorum were wrought among you in patientia, in signis, et prodigiis, et virtutibus.",
  "For what is it wherein ye were inferior to Ecclesiae, nisi in eo quod non fui gravosus vobis? Excuse me this injury.",
  "Behold, for the tertiam I prepare to venire ad vos; and I will not be gravosus ad vos: for I seek not vestra, sed vos: for filii debent thesaurizare parentibus, non autem parentes filiis.",
  "But I will very gladly spend, and be spent for animas vestras: though I love vos plus, minus amabor.",
  "But be it so, I did not burden vos: sed being crafty, I caught vos per astutiam.",
  "Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you?",
  "I desired Titum, and with him I sent a fratrem: did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in eodem spiritu? walked we not in eisdem vestigiis?",
  "Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before Deus in Christo: but we do all things, dilecti, for vestra edificationem.",
  "For I fear, lest, when I venire, I shall not find vos such as I would, and that I shall be found unto vos such as ye would not, lest there be contentiones, aemulationes, irae, simultates, detractiones, whisperings, tumores, seditiones:",
  "Lest when I come again, my Deus will humble me among you, and that I shall bewail many which have peccatum already, and have not repented of the impurities, and fornicationes, and impudicitia which they have committed."
