                    <p>And the sons of Noe, going out of the arca, were Sem, Ham, and Japheth. And Ham is the pater of Chanaan.</p>
<p>These are the filii of Noe: and of them was the orbis terrarum repeopled after the diluvium.</p>
<p>And the filii of Japheth: Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.</p>
<p>And the filii of Gomer: Aschkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.</p>
<p>And the filii of Javan: Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.</p>
<p>The filii of Ham: Chus, and Misraim, and Put, and Chanaan.</p>
<p>And the filii of Chus: Saba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtecha. And the filii of Raamah: Seba, and Dedan.</p>
<p>And Chus begat Nimrod: qui coepit esse potens in terra.</p>
<p>He was a venator before the Domino: wherefore it is said: sicut Nimrod venator before the Domino.</p>
<p>And the beginning of his regnum was Babylon, and Arach, and Achad, and Chalanne in terra Sennaar.</p>
<p>Out of that land came Assur, and built Ninive, and the streets of the city, and Chalach:</p>
<p>And Dase, between Ninive and Chalach: this is the great civitas.</p>
<p>And Misraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim:</p>
<p>And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, out of whom came the Philistim, and Caphtorim.</p>
<p>And Chanaan begat Sidon his primogenitum, and the Hethite:</p>
<p>And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite, and the Hevite, and the Arakite, and the Sinite:</p>
<p>And the Aradian, and the Samarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward the families of the Chanaanite were spread abroad.</p>
<p>And the border of the Chanaanite was from Sidon, as thou goest to Gerar, unto Gaza: as thou goest to Sodoma, and Gomorra, and Adama, and Seboim, unto Lesa.</p>
<p>These are the filii of Ham, according to their families, and their linguae, in their terrae, and in their gentibus.</p>
