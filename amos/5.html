                    <p>1 Hear this word, ye kine of Bashan, that are in the montibus of Samaria, which oppress the pauperes, which crush the inopes, which say to their dominus, Bring, and let us potare.</p>
<p>2 The Dominus Deus hath sworn by His sanctuarium, Behold, the dies shall come upon you, that He shall take you away with hooks, and your posteriores with fishhooks.</p>
<p>3 And I will make you to go out of this civitas unto the borders of Damascus, saith the Dominus, whose Nomen is The God of exercitus hostes.</p>
<p>4 Turn ye at My word, saith the Dominus of exercitus hostes, and take hold of the veritas, and establish misericordia and iustitia in your portae: it may be that the Dominus Deus of exercitus hostes will be propitius unto the reliquiae of Ioseph.</p>
<p>5 But I hate, I despise your festa dies, and I will not smell the odorem of your solemnitates.</p>
<p>6 Though ye offer unto Me holocausta et oblationes, I will not accept them: neither will I regard the pacifici of your pingues animalia.</p>
<p>7 Therefore will I cause you to transmigrare beyond Damascus, saith the Dominus, whose Nomen is The God of exercitus hostes.</p>
<p>8 The Dominus Deus hath sworn by the gloria of Iacob, Surely I will never oblivisci any of their opera.</p>
<p>9 And it shall come to pass in that die, saith the Dominus Deus, that I will make the sol to descend at meridie, and I will tenebrous the terram in the die of lumen:</p>
<p>10 And I will turn your festa dies into luctus, and all your cantica into lamentationem: and I will bring up super vestes your sagum, and super calceamenta your ligatura.</p>
<p>11 And I will bring super vos the famem, et consumam your reliquiae, and you shall be in tribulationibus, as a virguncula that hath lost her pater.</p>
<p>12 Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O Israel: and because I will do this unto thee, prepare to meet Me, O Israel.</p>
<p>13 For, lo, I that form the montes, and create the ventus, and declare unto man what is His cogitatio, that make the aurora tenebrosus, and tread upon the altitudinem of the terra, the Dominus Deus exercitus is His Nomen.</p>
<p>14 Seek the bonum, and not the malum, that you may live: and the Dominus Deus exercitus shall be with you, as ye have spoken.</p>
<p>15 Hate the malum, and love the bonum, and establish iustitia in your portae: it may be that the Dominus Deus exercitus will be propitius unto the reliquiae of Ioseph.</p>
<p>16 Therefore the Dominus, the Deus exercitus, Dominus, saith thus; In omnibus plateis lamentationem, and in omnibus viis they shall say, Vae, vae: and they shall call the agricola to luctus, and such as are docti in lamentatione to lamentationem.</p>
<p>17 And in all vineis shall be lamentationem: for I will pass through in medio tui, saith the Dominus.</p>
<p>18 Vae, that desire the diem of the Dominus! to what end is it for you? the diem of the Dominus is tenebrosus, and not lucidus.</p>
<p>19 As if a vir would flee from the facies of a leo, and a ursus would meet him; or would go into the domus, and lean his manus on the paries, and a serpent would mordere him.</p>
<p>20 Shall not the diem of the Dominus be tenebrosus, and non lucidus? and shall not the lumen of it be sicut the caligo?</p>
<p>21 I hate, I despise your festa dies, saith the Dominus, and I will not smell the odorem of your solemnitates.</p>
<p>22 Though ye offer unto Me holocausta et oblationes, I will not accept them; neither will I regard the pacifici of your pingues animalia.</p>
<p>23 Take away from Me the tumultus of thy cantica; for I will not hear the sonus of thy lyrae.</p>
<p>24 But let iustitia flow as amnis, et rectitudo as a rivus that never faileth.</p>
<p>25 Have ye offered unto Me sacrifices et oblationes in the desert forty annos, O domus of Israel?</p>
<p>26 Yea, ye have borne the tabernaculum of your Moloch, et sidus of your dei, figures which ye made to adore them.</p>
<p>27 And I will transmigrare you beyond Damascus, saith the Dominus, whose Nomen is The God of exercitus hostes.</p>
<p>28 Vae, that are confident in the montibus of Samaria, who sit in the angulus of the lectus, et in the beds of the lectus of the domus of Israel, who drink vina in calicibus, et unguentis vos unguntis de oleo optimo.</p>
<p>29 Therefore now shall they go captive with the primus that shall go captive, and the convivium of the negligentia shall be destroyed, saith the Dominus Deus.</p>
