  "Paulus, a servant of Deus, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the promise of vita that is in Christ Jesus,",
  "To Timothy, my dearly beloved filius, grace, misericordia, and pax, from Deus the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.",
  "I thank Deus, whom I serve from my progenitors with a pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my orationes;",
  "Nighting and daying I greatly desire to see thee, being mindful of thy lacrimae, that I may be filled with gaudium;",
  "When I call to remembrance the fides that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy avia Lois, and thy mater Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also.",
  "That thou stir up the donum of Deus, which is in thee by the imposition of my manus;",
  "For Deus hath not given us the spiritus of timidity; but of virtus, and of amor, and of sobrietatem.",
  "Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimonium of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictio of the gospel according to the virtus of Deus;",
  "That is, that God hath saved us, and called us with a holy vocatio, not according to our opera, but according to his propria voluntas and gratia, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the worlds began;",
  "But hath in due times manifested his verb in preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of Deus our Saviour;",
  "To Titus, mine own filius, according to the communi fides: grace, misericordia, and pax, from Deus the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour."
