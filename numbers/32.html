                    <p>And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a multitude of cattle, and when they saw the land of Jazer and the land of Gilead, that behold it was a place aptus for cattle,</p>
<p>They came unto Moses, and unto Eleazar the sacerdos, and unto the principes of the congregation, and said,</p>
<p>Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon,</p>
<p>Even the country which the Lord smote before the congregation of Israel, is a land aptus for cattle, and thy servus have a multitude of cattle:</p>
<p>Wherefore, said they, if we have found gratia in thy sight, let this land be given unto thy servus for a possession, and bring us not over Jordan.</p>
<p>And Moses said unto them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will go armed before the Lord to war,</p>
<p>And will go all of you armati over Jordan before the Lord, until he hath driven out his inimicus before him,</p>
<p>And the land be subdued before the Lord: then afterward ye shall return, and be guiltless before the Lord, and before Israel; and this land shall be your possessio before the Lord.</p>
<p>But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have peccatum against the Lord: and be sure your peccatum will find you out.</p>
<p>Build you cities for your liberi, and folds for your pecus; and do that which hath egressus out of your os;</p>
<p>And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake unto Moses, saying, Thy servus will do as my lord commandeth.</p>
<p>Our liberi, our wives, our pecus, and all our animus shall be there in the cities of Gilead:</p>
<p>But thy servus will pass over, every one armatus for war, before the Lord to the war, as my lord saith.</p>
<p>So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the sacerdos, and Joshua the filius of Nun, and the dux of the tribus of the filii of Israel:</p>
<p>And Moses said unto them, If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over Jordan, every one armatus for war, before the Lord, and the land shall be subdued before you; then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a possessio:</p>
<p>But if they will not pass over with you armati, they shall have possessio among you in the land of Canaan.</p>
<p>And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, As the Lord hath spoken unto thy servus, so will we do.</p>
<p>We will pass over armati before the Lord into the land of Canaan, that the possessio of our hereditas may be to us on this side Jordan.</p>
<p>And Moses gave unto them, even to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and unto half the tribus of Manasseh, the filius of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon rex of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og rex of Bashan, the land, with the cities of it in the coasts, even the cities of the land round about.</p>
<p>And the children of Machir the filius of Manasseh went to Gilead, and took it, and dispossessed the Amorite which was in it.</p>
<p>And Moses gave Gilead unto Machir the filius of Manasseh; and he dwelt therein.</p>
<p>And Jair the filius of Manasseh went and took the small towns thereof, and called them Havothjair.</p>
<p>And Nobah went and took Kenath, and the villages thereof, and called it Nobah, after his own nomen.</p>
