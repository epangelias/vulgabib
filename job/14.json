  "Man that is born of a mulier, is of few dies, and full of miseria.",
  "He cometh forth like a flos, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a umbra, and continueth not.",
  "And doth thou open thine oculus upon such an one, and bringest me in judgment with thee?",
  "Who can bring a mundus out of an immundus? not one.",
  "That which is born of the carne, is carne; and that which is born of the Spiritus, is spiritus.",
  "Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.",
  "The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sonus thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spiritus.",
  "Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?",
  "Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a magister of Israel, and knowest not these things?",
  "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our testimonium.",
  "If I have told you terrenum things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you caelestium things?",
  "And no man hath ascendit up to caelum, but he that came down from caelum, even the Son of homo, which is in caelum.",
  "And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desertum, so must the Son of homo be lifted up: That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have vitam aeternam.",
  "For God so loved the mundus, that he gave his unigenitus Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have vitam aeternam.",
  "For God sent not his Son into the mundus to condemn the mundus; but that the mundus through him might be saved.",
  "He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the nomen of the only begotten Son of God."
