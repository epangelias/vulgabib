  "Preserve me, O Deus, for in thee do I put my trust.",
  "O my soul, thou hast said unto the Dominus, Thou art my Deus: for thou hast no reward above.",
  "As for the sancti, who are in the terra, they are the excellent, in whom is all my delicia.",
  "Their idola have multiplied their afflictions: afterwards they hastened to offer their sacrificia to the simulacra.",
  "Their libamina of wine I will not offer, nor take the nomina of their idola into my labia.",
  "The Dominus is the pars of mine hereditas and of my calix: thou maintainest my sortem.",
  "The linea are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a good hereditas.",
  "Blessed be the Dominus, who hath given me counsel: therefore my reins also instruct me in nocte seasons.",
  "I have set the Dominus always before me: because he is at my dexter hand, I shall not be moved.",
  "Therefore my cor is glad, and my gloria rejoiceth: my caro also shall rest in spem.",
  "For thou wilt not leave my anima in infernus; neither wilt thou suffer thy Sanctus to see corruptio.",
  "Thou wilt shew me the semita of vita: in thy praesentia is plenitudo of gaudium; at thy dexter hand there are deliciae for evermore."
