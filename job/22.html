                    <p>Then Eliphaz the Temanite responded and said, 'Can a man be veritas with God, or a man be utilis to himself?'</p>
<p>Is it any utilis to thee that thou art iustus, or is it gain to thee that thou art sine peccato?'</p>
<p>What doth the Omnipotens repay thee for thy pietas, or what doth He accept from thy manus?'</p>
<p>Is it for fear of thee that He argueth with thee, and entereth into iudicium with thee?'</p>
<p>Is not thy malitia great, and thy iniquitates infinite?'</p>
<p>For thou takest a pledge from thy frater for nought, and strippeth the nudus of his vestimenta.'</p>
<p>Thou hast not given aqua to the sitienti, and hast withholden panis from the esurienti.'</p>
<p>Forasmuch as thou hast been potens, thou hast possessed the terra, and hast dwelt in it.'</p>
<p>Thou hast sent the viduae empty away, and the brachia of the pauperes hast thou broken.'</p>
<p>Therefore art thou ensnared with thy own manus, and thy own manus hath caught thee.'</p>
<p>This is the pars of a wicked man with God, and the hereditas of the violenti, which they shall receive of the Omnipotens.'</p>
<p>If thou cry out because of violentia, shall any hear thee? who shall prepare the auxilium for thee?'</p>
<p>Shall not God who is in caelis, and seeth all things, iudicare?'</p>
<p>And thou sayest, 'Quid scit Deus? can He iudicare through the caligo?'</p>
<p>Thinkest thou that He knoweth not, and that He turneth away his facies, and seeth not?'</p>
<p>But thou shalt know that He shall iudicare the iustus, and the malus He shall not iudicare.'</p>
<p>How long shall the impii iudicare, and the friends of Deus suffer?'</p>
<p>And he said to Iob, 'Hear, I pray thee, my sermones, and hearken to the verba of my os.'</p>
<p>If thou hast any thing to say, answere me, speak, for I desire to iustificare thee.'</p>
<p>If not, hearken unto me, and hold thy linguam, and I shall teach thee sapientiam.'</p>
<p>Why dost thou contend with the iudicia of Deus, and because the iustus suffereth, sayest thou, 'Quid scit Deus?''</p>
<p>Thinkest thou this to be iustum, that thou sayest, 'I shall be iustus, though thy modus sit contra Deum?''</p>
<p>Thou hast said, 'Quid scit Deus? and He shall not iudicare.'</p>
<p>But there is a man whose nomine is hidden, and being not cognitus, He iudicabit.'</p>
<p>And he shall iudicare the orbem with iustitia, and the populi with aequitate.'</p>
<p>Then Iob answered and said, 'Today also my querela is bitter, and my manus is strenua against the dolor of my animus.'</p>
<p>O that I knew where I might find Him, that I might come even to His sedes.'</p>
<p>I would declare unto Him the causam of my words, and fill my os with argumentis.'</p>
<p>I would know the verba which He would answere me, and understand what He would say unto me.'</p>
<p>Will He plead against me with fortitudo? No, surely He will put me in via recta.'</p>
<p>There the iustus shall corrigere me, and I shall escape with the magnitudo of my manus.'</p>
<p>Behold, in this thou art not iustus, I have chosen Deus for my iudicem.'</p>
<p>For He is not an homo as I am, that I should answere Him, and we should come together in iudicium.'</p>
<p>Neither is there any mediator between us, that might lay his manus upon us both.'</p>
<p>Let Him take away His manus from me, and let not His terror make me afraid.'</p>
<p>Then call I, and He answere me not, I stand and He consider me not.'</p>
<p>I am iustus, and He hath taken away my ius, and made me contemptum.'</p>
<p>He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone, and hath taken away my spem, as a tree.'</p>
<p>My fiducia also hath He removed, and hath taken away the coronam of my capite.'</p>
<p>He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone, and hath taken away my spem, as a tree.'</p>
<p>I have declared unto Him the causam of my words, and I shall not hide the verba of the Omnipotens.'</p>
<p>O that my dolor were thoroughly weighed, and my calamitas laid in the statera together.'</p>
<p>For now it would be heavier than the arena of the mari, therefore I have spoken.'</p>
<p>Is not my dolor great, and my calamitas infinite?'</p>
<p>For I know that I shall be iustificatus, and I shall behold my salus, and no homo shall see my facies.'</p>
