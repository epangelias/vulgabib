  "After these things Jesus walked in Galilaea: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Iudaei sought to kill him.",
  "Now the Iudaei feast of tabernacles was at hand.",
  "His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Iudaea, that thy discipluli also may see the opera which thou doest.",
  "For there is no man that doth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the mundo.",
  "For neither did his brethren credit in him.",
  "Then Jesus said unto them, My tempus is not yet come: but your tempus is alway ready.",
  "The mundo cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testimonium perhibeo of it, that the opera thereof are mala.",
  "Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast; for my tempus is not yet full come.",
  "When he had said these words unto them, he abode still in Galilaea.",
  "But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as in occulto.",
  "Then the Iudaei sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?",
  "And there was much murmuring among the multitudines concerning him: for some said, He is bonus: others said, Nay; but he seduceth the populum.",
  "Howbeit no man spake openly of him for feare of the Iudaei.",
  "Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the templum, and taught.",
  "And the Iudaei marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man litteras, having never learned?",
  "Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrina is not mine, but his that sent me.",
  "If any man will do his voluntas, he shall know of the doctrina, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.",
  "He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own gloria: but he that seeketh his gloria that sent him, the same is verax, and no iniquitas is in him.",
  "Did not Moses give you the legem, and yet none of you keepeth the legem? Why go ye about to kill me?",
  "The populus answered, and said, Thou hast a daemon, who goeth about to kill thee?",
  "Jesus answered, and said unto them, I have done one opus, and ye all marvel.",
  "Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision, (not because it is of Moses, but of the patres;) and ye on the sabbatum circumcidetis a man.",
  "If a man on the sabbatum receiveth circumcision, that the legem of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man sane on the sabbatum?",
  "Iudice not according to the species, but iudice righteous iudgement.",
  "Then said some of them of Hierusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?",
  "But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?",
  "Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.",
  "Then cried Jesus in the templum as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is verax, whom ye know not.",
  "But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.",
  "Then they sought to apprehend him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hora was not yet come.",
  "And many of the populus believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more signa than these which Jesus hath done?",
  "The Pharisaeei heard that the populus murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisaeei and the chief sacerdotes sent officers to take him.",
  "Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto him that sent me.",
  "Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come.",
  "Then said the Iudaei among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersion among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?",
  "What manner of saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come?",
  "In the last day, that great day of the festum, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.",
  "He that believeth on me, as the scriptura hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of aqua viva.",
  "But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believed on him should receive: for the Holy Spirit was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorificatus.",
  "Many of the populus therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Propheta.",
  "Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilaea?",
  "Hath not the scriptura said, That Christ cometh of the semen of David, and out of the civitas of Bethlehem, where David was?",
  "So there was a dissensio among the populus about him.",
  "And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.",
  "Then came the ministri to the chief sacerdotes and Pharisaeei; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?",
  "The ministri answered, Never man spake like this man.",
  "Then answered them the Pharisaeei, Are ye also deceived?",
  "Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisaeei believed on him?",
  "But this populus which knoweth not the legem are cursed.",
  "Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by noctem, being one of them,)",
  "Doth our legem iudice any man, before it hear him, and know what he doth?",
  "They answered, and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilaea? Search, and look: for out of Galilaea ariseth no Propheta.",
  "And every man went unto his own domus."
