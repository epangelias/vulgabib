                    <p>And the men of Kirjathjearim came, and fetched up the ark of the Lord, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the arca Dei.</p>
<p>And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kirjathjearim, that the many dies of the Lord were multiplied, and the Lord was magnus among the filii Israel.</p>
<p>And the filii Israel did put away the Baalim and the Astaroth, and served the Lord only.</p>
<p>Then Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye do return unto the Lord with all your heart, then put away the deos alienos and the Astaroth from among you, and prepare your corda to serve the Lord, and serve him only: and he will deliver you out of the manus of the Philistines.</p>
<p>So they gathered unto Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured it out before the Lord, and fasted on that dies, and said there, We have peccatum against the Lord. And Samuel judged the filii Israel in Mizpeh.</p>
<p>And when the Philistines heard that the filii Israel were gathered together to Mizpeh, the principes of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the filii Israel heard it, they were timidi.</p>
<p>Wherefore the filii Israel said unto Samuel, Cease not to clamare for us unto the Lord our God, that he will save us out of the manus of the Philistines.</p>
<p>And Samuel took a petra lactis, and offered it for a holocaust to the Lord, and clamavit unto the Lord for Israel; and the Lord exaudivit him.</p>
<p>And as Samuel was offering the holocaust, the Philistines drew near to proelium against Israel: but the Lord thundered with a great voice on that dies upon the Philistines, and they were confusi, and they fled before Israel.</p>
<p>And the filii Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the Philistines, and smote them, until they came under Bethcar.</p>
<p>Then Samuel took a petram, and set it between Mizpeh and Shen, and called the name of it Ebenhaezer, saying, Hitherto hath the Lord holpen us.</p>
<p>So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into the fines of Israel: and the manus of the Lord was against the Philistines all the dies of Samuel.</p>
<p>And the civitates which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even unto Gath; and the fines of Israel were liberated from the manus of the Philistines. And there was pax between Israel and the Amorrhites.</p>
<p>And Samuel judged Israel all the dies of his vita.</p>
<p>And he went from annum in annum, and visited Bethel, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and judged Israel in all those loci.</p>
<p>And his return was to Ramatha; for there was his domus; and there he judged Israel; and he built there an altare to the Lord.</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his filii judges over Israel.</p>
<p>Now the name of his primus filius was Joel; and the name of his secundus filius was Abiah: they were judges in Beersheba.</p>
<p>And his filii walked not in his viis, but they were avari, and accepted munera, and perverterunt judicium.</p>
<p>Then all the anciani of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramatha,</p>
<p>And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy filii walk not in thy viis: now make us a rex to judge us like all the gentes.</p>
<p>But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a rex to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the Lord.</p>
<p>And the Lord said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the vox of the populus in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reigne over them.</p>
<p>According to all the opera which they have done since the dies that I brought them up out of Aegypto even unto this dies, wherewith they have forsaken me, and served other deos, so do they also unto thee.</p>
<p>Now therefore hearken unto their vox: howbeit yet protesta them solemnly, and shew them the ius of the rex that shall reigne over them.</p>
<p>And Samuel told all the words of the Lord unto the populus that asked of him a rex.</p>
<p>And he said, This shall be the ius of the rex that shall reigne over you: He shall take your filii, and appoint them for himself, for his currus, and to be his equites; and some shall run before his currus.</p>
<p>And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and will set them to ear his terra, and to reap his messis, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his currus;</p>
<p>And he will take your filiae to be confectionarii, and to be coquae, and to be panificae.</p>
<p>And he will take your fields, and your vineae, and your oliveta, even the best of them, and give them to his servientes.</p>
<p>And he will take the decimam of your seed, and of your vineae, and give to his eunuchis, and to his servientes.</p>
<p>And he will take your servientes, and your ancillae, and your goodly young men, and your asses, and put them to his opera.</p>
<p>He will take the decimam of your flocks: and ye shall be his servientes.</p>
<p>And ye shall clamare in that dies because of your rex which ye shall have chosen you; and the Lord will not exaudire you in that dies.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the populus refused to obey the vox of Samuel; and they said, Nay; but we will have a rex over us;</p>
<p>That we also may be like all the gentes; and that our rex may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our proelia.</p>
<p>And Samuel heard all the words of the populus, and he rehearsed them in the aures of the Lord.</p>
<p>And the Lord said to Samuel, Hearken unto their vox, and make them a rex. And Samuel said unto the filii Israel, Go ye every man unto his civitas.</p>
