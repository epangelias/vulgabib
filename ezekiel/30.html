                    <p>1 And the word of the Dominus came again unto me, saying,</p>
<p>2 Son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Dominus Deus; Howl ye, Woe worth the day!</p>
<p>3 For the day is near, even the day of the Ira Dei is near, it shall be a day of tumult from the gentes.</p>
<p>4 And the gladius shall come upon Egypt, and great pain shall be in Ethiopia, when the wounded shall fall in Egypt, and they shall take away her multitude, and her foundations shall be broken down.</p>
<p>5 Ethiopia, and Libya, and Lydia, and all the mingled people, and Chub, and the children of the land that is in league, shall fall with them by the gladius.</p>
<p>6 Thus saith the Dominus Deus; They also that uphold Egypt shall fall; and the pride of her potentia shall come down: from the tower of Syene shall they fall in it by the gladius, saith the Dominus Deus.</p>
<p>7 And they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate, and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are wasted.</p>
<p>8 And they shall know that I am the Dominus, when I have set a ignis in Egypt, and when all her helpers shall be destroyed.</p>
<p>9 In that day shall messengers go forth from me in navis to make careless Ethiopia, and great pain shall come upon them, as in the day of Egypt: for, behold, it cometh.</p>
<p>10 Thus saith the Dominus Deus; I will also make the multitude of Egypt to cease by the hand of Nabuchodonosor rex of Babylon.</p>
<p>11 He and his people with him the terrible of the gentes shall be brought to destroy the land: and they shall draw their swords against Egypt, and fill the land with the slain.</p>
<p>12 And I will make the flumina dry, and sell the land into the hand of the mali: and I will make the land waste, and all that is therein, by the hand of strangers: I the Dominus have spoken it.</p>
<p>13 Thus saith the Dominus Deus; I will also destroy the simulacra, and cause their idols to cease out of Noph; and there shall be no more a prince of the land of Egypt: and I will put a fear in the land of Egypt.</p>
<p>14 And I will make Pathros desolate, and will set a ignis in Zoan, and will execute judgments in No.</p>
<p>15 And I will pour my indignation upon Pelusium, the strength of Egypt; and I will cut off the multitude of No.</p>
<p>16 And I will set a ignis in Egypt: Pelusium shall have great pain, and No shall be rent asunder, and Noph shall have distresses daily.</p>
<p>17 The young men of Aven and of Pibeseth shall fall by the gladius: and these cities shall go into captivity.</p>
<p>18 At Tehaphnehes also the day shall be darkened, when I shall break there the sceptres of Egypt: and the pride of her potentia shall cease in her: a cloud shall cover her, and her daughters shall go into captivity.</p>
<p>19 Thus I will execute judgments in Egypt: and they shall know that I am the Dominus.</p>
<p>20 And it came to pass in the undecim year, in the first month, in the seventh day of the month, that the word of the Dominus came unto me, saying,</p>
<p>21 Son of man, I have broken the brachium of Pharaoh rex of Egypt; and, lo, it shall not be bound up to be healed, to put a roller to bind it, to make it strong to hold the gladius.</p>
<p>22 Therefore thus saith the Dominus Deus; Behold, I am against Pharaoh rex of Egypt, and will break his arms, the strong and that which was broken; and I will cause the gladium to fall out of his hand.</p>
<p>23 And I will scatter the Aegyptios among the gentes, and will disperse them through the countries.</p>
<p>24 And I will strengthen the brachium of the rex of Babylon, and put my gladium in his hand: but I will break Pharaoh's arms, and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded man.</p>
<p>25 But I will strengthen the arms of the rex of Babylon, and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down; and they shall know that I am the Dominus, when I shall put my gladium into the hand of the rex of Babylon, and he shall stretch it out upon the land of Egypt.</p>
<p>26 And I will scatter the Aegyptios among the gentes, and will disperse them through the countries; and they shall know that I am the Dominus.</p>
