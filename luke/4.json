  "And Jesus being full of the Spiritis, returned from Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the desertum,",
  "Being forty days tempted of the diabolus. And in those days he did eat nothing: and when they were ended, he afterward was hungry.",
  "And the diabolus said unto him, If thou be the Son of Deus, command this lapidem that it be made panis.",
  "And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, That man shall not live by panis alone, but by every verbum of Deus.",
  "And the diabolus, taking him up into a high montem, shewed unto him all the regna of the world in a moment of tempus.",
  "And the diabolus said unto him, All this potentia will I give thee, and the gloria of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it.",
  "If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine.",
  "And Jesus answered and said unto him, Get thee behind me, Satanas: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy Deus, and him only shalt thou servire.",
  "And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnaculum of the templum, and said unto him, If thou be the Son of Deus, cast thyself down from hence:",
  "For it is written, He shall give his angelis charge over thee, to keep thee:",
  "And in their manus they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a lapidem.",
  "And Jesus answering said unto him, It is said, Thou shalt not temptare the Lord thy Deus.",
  "And when the diabolus had ended all the tentationem, he departed from him for a seasonum.",
  "And Jesus returned in the potentia of the Spirit into Galilaea: and there went out a fama of him through all the regionem.",
  "And he taught in their synagogues, being glorificus of all.",
  "And he came to Nazareth, where he had been nutritus: and, as his consuetudo was, he went into the synagoga on the sabbatum day, and stood up for to read.",
  "And there was delivered unto him the liber of the propheta Esaias. And when he had opened the liber, he found the place where it was written,",
  "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the Evangelium to the pauperes; he hath sent me to heal the contritos of heart, to preach deliverance to the captivos, and recovering of sight to the caecis, to set at libertas them that are oppressi,",
  "To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.",
  "And he closed the liber, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat down. And the eyes of all them that were in the synagoga were fastened on him.",
  "And he began to say unto them, This day is this scriptura fulfilled in your aures.",
  "And all bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious verba which proceeded out of his os.",
  "And they said, Is not this the filius of Joseph?",
  "And he said unto them, Ye will surely say unto me this proverb, Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in thy patria.",
  "And he said, Verily I say unto you, No propheta is accepted in his patria.",
  "But I tell you of a veritas, many viduae were in Israel in the dies of Elias, when the caelum was shut up three years and six menses, when great famis was throughout all the terra;",
  "And unto none of them was Elias sent, save unto Sarepta, a civitas of Sidon, unto a mulier that was a vidua.",
  "And many leprosi were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the propheta; and none of them was mundatus, saving Naaman the Syrian.",
  "And all they in the synagoga, when they heard these verba, were filled with ira,",
  "And rose up, and thrust him out of the civitas, and led him unto the summitas of the montem that the civitas was built on, that they might precipitare him.",
  "But he passing through the midst of them went his way,",
  "And came down to Capernaum, a civitas of Galilaea, and taught them on the sabbatum days.",
  "And they were astonished at his doctrina: for his verbum was with potentia.",
  "And in the synagoga there was a homo, having a spiritum immundum; and he cried out with a great vox,",
  "Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art; the Sanctus of Deus.",
  "And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Sile, and come out of him. And when the daemonium had thrown him in the midst, he came out of him, and hurt him not.",
  "And they were all amazed, and spake among themselves, saying, What a verbum is this! for with auctoritas and potentia he commandeth the spiritus immundos, and they come out.",
  "And the fama of him went out into every place of the regionem.",
  "And he arose out of the synagoga, and entered into Simon's domus. And Simon's mother-in-law was taken with a great febris; and they besought him for her.",
  "And he stood over her, and rebuked the febrim; and it left her: and immediately she arose and ministered unto them.",
  "Now when the sol was setting, all they that had any sick with diversis languoribus brought them unto him; and he laid his manus upon every one of them, and healed them.",
  "And devorans also came out of many, crying out, and saying, Thou art the filius of Deus. And rebuking them suffered them not to speak: for they knew that he was the Christus.",
  "And when it was day, he departed and went into a desertum place: and the people sought him, and came unto him, and stayed him, that he should not depart from them.",
  "And he said unto them, I must preach the regnum of Deus to other civitates also: for therefore am I sent.",
  "And he preached in the synagogis of Galilaea."
