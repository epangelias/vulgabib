  "Take heed that ye do not your caritas before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Pater which is in heaven.",
  "Beware of practising your pietas before men in order to be seen by them; for then you will have no recompense from your Pater who is in the heavens.",
  "When therefore thou doest thine eleemosyna, sound not a trumpet before thee, as the hypocritae do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.",
  "But when thou doest alms, let not thy sinister hand know what thy dexter hand doeth:",
  "That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Pater which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.",
  "And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocritae are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.",
  "But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy cubiculum, and when thou hast shut thy ostium, pray to thy Pater which is in secret; and thy Pater which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.",
  "But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the gentes do: for they think that they shall be heard for their multis sermonibus.",
  "Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Pater knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.",
  "After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Pater which art in the heavens, Hallowed be thy nomen.",
  "Thy regnum come, Thy voluntas be done in terra, as it is in caelo:",
  "Give us this day our supersubstantialis panis:",
  "And forgive us our debita, as we forgive our debitoribus:",
  "And lead us not into temptatio, but deliver us from malus:",
  "For thine is the regnum, and the potentia, and the gloria, in saecula, Amen.",
  "For if ye forgive men their peccata, your caelestis Pater will also forgive you:",
  "But if ye forgive not men their peccata, neither will your Pater forgive your peccata.",
  "Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocritae, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.",
  "But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine caput, and wash thy facies;",
  "That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Pater which is in secret: and thy Pater, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.",
  "Lay not up for yourselves thesauri upon terra, where moth and ruginem do corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:",
  "But lay up for yourselves thesauri in caelo, where neither moth nor ruginem doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:",
  "For where your thesaurus is, there will your cor be also.",
  "The lucerna of the corpus is the oculus: if therefore thine oculus be simplex, thy whole corpus shall be full of lux.",
  "But if thine oculus be malignant, thy whole corpus shall be full of tenebrae. If therefore the lux that is in thee be tenebrae, how great is that tenebrae!",
  "No man can serve two domini: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve Deus and Mammona.",
  "Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your vita, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your corpus, what ye shall put on. Is not the vita more than meat, and the corpus than raiment?",
  "Behold the aves of the heaven: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your caelestis Pater feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?",
  "Which of you by taking thought can add one cubitus unto his stature?",
  "And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilia of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:",
  "And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his gloria was not arrayed like one of these.",
  "Wherefore, if Deus so clothe the gramina of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the clibanus, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little fides?",
  "Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?",
  "(For after all these things do the gentes seek:) for your caelestis Pater knoweth that ye have need of all these things.",
  "But seek ye first the regnum of Deus, and his justitia; and all these things shall be added unto you.",
  "Take therefore no thought for the cras: for the cras shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficit unto the die its own malum."
