                    <p>Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his dominus, neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him.</p>
<p>If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.</p>
<p>I speak not of you all: I know whom I have elected, but that the Scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me shall lift up his calceus against me.</p>
<p>Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am He.</p>
<p>Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto Him that sent me.</p>
<p>Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come.</p>
<p>Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.</p>
<p>And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this mundus; I am not of this mundus.</p>
<p>I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your peccata: for if ye believe not that I am He, ye shall die in your peccata.</p>
<p>Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning.</p>
<p>I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.</p>
<p>Howbeit when he, the Spirit of veritas, is come, he will guide you into all veritas: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.</p>
<p>He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you.</p>
<p>A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Pater.</p>
<p>Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Pater?</p>
<p>They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? we cannot tell what he saith.</p>
<p>Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me?</p>
<p>Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament, but the mundus shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but your tristitia shall be turned into gaudium.</p>
<p>A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the mundus.</p>
<p>And ye now therefore have tristitia: but I will see you again, and your cor shall rejoice, and your gaudium no man taketh from you.</p>
<p>And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Pater in my name, he will give it you.</p>
<p>Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your gaudium may be full.</p>
<p>These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Pater.</p>
<p>At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Pater for you:</p>
<p>For the Pater himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.</p>
<p>I came forth from the Pater, and am come into the mundus: again, I leave the mundus, and go to the Pater.</p>
<p>His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb.</p>
<p>Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God.</p>
<p>Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?</p>
<p>Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Pater is with me.</p>
<p>These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have pax. In the mundus ye shall have tribulatio: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the mundus.</p>
