                    <p>Paulus, a servant of Deus, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the promise of vita that is in Christ Jesus,</p>
<p>To Timothy, my dearly beloved filius, grace, misericordia, and pax, from Deus the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
<p>I thank Deus, whom I serve from my progenitors with a pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my orationes;</p>
<p>Nighting and daying I greatly desire to see thee, being mindful of thy lacrimae, that I may be filled with gaudium;</p>
<p>When I call to remembrance the fides that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy avia Lois, and thy mater Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also.</p>
<p>That thou stir up the donum of Deus, which is in thee by the imposition of my manus;</p>
<p>For Deus hath not given us the spiritus of timidity; but of virtus, and of amor, and of sobrietatem.</p>
<p>Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimonium of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictio of the gospel according to the virtus of Deus;</p>
<p>That is, that God hath saved us, and called us with a holy vocatio, not according to our opera, but according to his propria voluntas and gratia, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the worlds began;</p>
<p>But hath in due times manifested his verb in preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of Deus our Saviour;</p>
<p>To Titus, mine own filius, according to the communi fides: grace, misericordia, and pax, from Deus the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.</p>
