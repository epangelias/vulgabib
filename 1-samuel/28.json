  "And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered their exercitus together for warfare, to fight with Israel. And Achish said unto David, Know thou assuredly, that thou shalt go out with me to castra, thou and thy milites.",
  "And David said to Achish, Surely thou shalt know what thy servus will do. And Achish said to David, Therefore will I make thee custos of my head for ever.",
  "Now Samuel was mortuus, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own civitas. And Saul had taken away the mediums and the pythones out of the land.",
  "And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and pitched in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel, and they pitched in Gilboa.",
  "And when Saul saw the castra of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his cor was greatly trembled.",
  "And when Saul inquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not, neither by somnium, nor by Urim, nor by propheta.",
  "Then said Saul unto his servus, Seek me a mulier that hath a python, that I may go to her, and inquire of her. And his servus said to him, Behold, there is a mulier that hath a python at Endor.",
  "And Saul disguised himself, and put on other vestes, and he went, and two homines with him, and they came to the mulier by nocte: and he said, I pray thee, divine unto me by thy python, and bring me up, whom I shall name unto thee.",
  "And the mulier said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off those that have pythones and spiritus out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my anima, to cause me to be put to death?",
  "And Saul sware to her by the LORD, saying, As the LORD liveth, there shall no poena befall thee for this thing.",
  "Then said the mulier, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he said, Bring me up Samuel.",
  "And when the mulier saw Samuel, she cried with a loud vox, and the mulier spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou art Saul.",
  "And the rex said unto her, Fear not: what sawest thou? And the mulier said unto Saul, I saw deos ascending out of the terra.",
  "And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old homo cometh up; and he is covered with a pallium. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he inclined his facies to the terra, and bowed himself.",
  "And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make guerra against me, and Deus is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by propheta, nor by somnium: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make me know what I shall do.",
  "Then said Samuel, Wherefore then dost thou ask me, seeing the LORD is departed from thee, and is become thy inimicus?",
  "And the LORD hath done to him, as he spake by my manus: for the LORD hath rent the regnum out of thine manus, and given it to thy proximus, even to David:",
  "Because thou obeyedst not the vox of the LORD, nor executedst his ira upon Amalec, therefore hath the LORD done this thing unto thee this day.",
  "Moreover the LORD shall also deliver Israel with thee into the manus of the Philistines: and to morrow shalt thou and thy filii be with me: the LORD also shall deliver the castra of Israel into the manus of the Philistines.",
  "Then Saul fell straightway all along on the terra, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no fortitudo in him; for he had eaten no panis all the day, nor all the noctis.",
  "And the mulier came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled, and said unto him, Behold, thine ancilla hath obeyed thy vox, and I have put my anima in my manus, and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto me.",
  "Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the vox of thine ancilla, and let me set a morsel of panis before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have fortitudo, when thou goest on thy via.",
  "But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servus, and the mulier, urged him; and he hearkened unto their vox. So he arose from the terra, and sat upon the lectus.",
  "And the mulier had a vitula of the gregge in the domus, and she hasted, and killed it, and took panis, and kneaded it, and baked it from the farina, and brought it before Saul, and before his servus; and when they had eaten, they rose up to go.",
  "And they rose up in the noctis, and Saul went, and his two homines with him, and they came to the castra of the Philistines about the time of the prima vigilia."
