                    <p>1 Now it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael tertius, filius Nethaniae, the son of Elishama, of the seminis regalis, royal seed, came, and the duces, princes, of the regis, king, and the homines, men, of war, even decem, ten men, that were with him, from the regis, king, unto Gedaliah the filius, son, of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they ate panis, bread, together in Mizpah.</p>
<p>2 Then arose Ishmael tertius, filius Nethaniae, and the homines, men, of war, that were with him, and smote Gedaliah the filius, son, of Ahikam the filius, son, of Shaphan with gladius, sword, and mortuus, slew, him, whom the rex, king, of Babylon had constituted over terram, the land, Judah.</p>
<p>3 Ishmael tertius also mortuus, slew, all the Judaei, Jews, that were with him, even with Gedaliah in Mizpah, the viros, men, of war.</p>
<p>4 And secundum, the second, day after he had mortuus, slain, Gedaliah, and no homo, man, knew it,</p>
<p>5 That there came homines, men, from Sichem, from Silo, and from Samaria, quatuor, fourscore men, having rasas, shaved, barbas, beards, and vestes, garments, scissas, rent, and offertas, offerings, in manu, hand, to offer them in domo, house, Domini, of the Lord.</p>
<p>6 And Ishmael tertius, filius Nethaniae, went forth from Mizpah to occurrrere, meet, them, going, and lacrymans, weeping, and cum his, and dixit, said, Venite, Come to Gedaliah the filius, son, of Ahikam.</p>
<p>7 Et cum intrassent, And it was so, when they entered into medium, the midst, of the civitas, city, Ishmael tertius, filius Nethaniae, and the homines, men, that were with him, mortui, slew, them, in medio, midst, of the fovea, pit, and dixit, said, Ne videatis, Lest you see, the Chaldaei, Chaldeans, et timeatis, and fear.</p>
<p>8 Decem, Ten men, were, however, with Ishmael tertius, filius Nethaniae, and they interfecerunt, slew, Gedaliah, and the homines, men, that were with him in Mizpah.</p>
<p>9 Et cuncti, And all, the populus, people, of Mizpah, et mulieres, and the women, et parvuli, and the little ones, et eunuchi, and the eunuchs, quem, whom, Ishmael tertius, filius Nethaniae, cepit, took, and projecit, cast, them in foveam, pit,</p>
<p>10 Et Ishmael tertius, filius Nethaniae, abiit, went, with the viros, men, of war, and venit, came, to filio, son, of Ammon.</p>
<p>11 Cumque, Now when, Johanan tertius, filius Kareah, and all the duces, princes, of the exercitus, army, that were with him, audissent, heard, of universae, all, the malae, evils, quas, which, fecerat, had done, Ishmael tertius, filius Nethaniae,</p>
<p>12 Tulerunt, They took, omnem, all, the exercitum, army, and venerunt, came, and pugnaverunt, fought, cum Ishmael tertio, filio Nethaniae, in aquarum, waters, of the lacus, lake, of Samaria.</p>
<p>13 Cumque, Now when, omnis, all, the populus, people, qui erat, that was, with Ishmael tertio, filio Nethaniae, vidisset, saw, Johanan tertium, filium Kareah, et universos, and all, the duces, princes, of the exercitus, army, qui erant, that were, cum eo, with him, reversi sunt, they turned, ad eum, to him.</p>
<p>14 Et pugnavit, And fought, Johanan tertius, filius Kareah, cum Ishmael tertio, filio Nethaniae, et interfecit, slew, eum, him, et universi, and all, the exercitus, army, qui erat, that was, cum eo, with him, et dispersi sunt, and were scattered, in omnem, all, terram, the land, Judah.</p>
<p>15 Tunc, Then Ishmael tertius, filius Nethaniae, et octo, eight, of the homines, men, qui erant, that were, cum eo, with him, fugerunt, fled, ad filium, son, of Ammon.</p>
<p>16 Johanan tertius, filius Kareah, et universi, and all, the duces, princes, of the exercitus, army, qui erant, that were, cum eo, with him, cepit, took, omnem, all, the reliquias, remnants, of the populus, people, quem, whom, servaverat, had saved, de manu, hand, of Ishmael tertii, filii Nethaniae, de Mizpah, after he had mortuus, slain, Gedaliah the filius, son, of Ahikam, the fortis, strong, vir, man, of war, et mulieres, and the women, et parvuli, and the little ones, et eunuchi, and the eunuchs, quos, whom, reduxerat, had brought back, de Gibeon, to Mizpah.</p>
