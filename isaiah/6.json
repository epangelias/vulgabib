  "In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the templum.",
  "Above it stood the seraphim: each one had six alas: with twain he covered his facies, and with twain he covered his pedes, and with twain he did fly.",
  "And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts: the whole terra is full of his gloria.",
  "And the posts of the threshold moved at the vox of him that cried, and the domus was filled with fumus.",
  "Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a homo of unclean labia, and I dwell in the midst of a populus of unclean labia: for mine oculi have seen the King, the Lord of hosts.",
  "Then flew one of the seraphim unto me, having a carbuncle in his manus, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altare:",
  "And he laid it upon my os, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy labia; and thine iniquitas is taken away, and thy peccatum is purged.",
  "Also I heard the vox of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me.",
  "And he said, Go, and say unto this populus, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.",
  "Make the cor of this populus fat, and make their aures heavy, and shut their oculi; lest they see with their oculi, and hear with their aures, and understand with their cor, and convert, and be healed.",
  "Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the civitates be wasted without inhabitant, and the domus without man, and the terra be utterly desolate,",
  "And the Lord have removed men far away, and there be a great forsakenness in the midst of the terra.",
  "But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and shall be eaten: as a terebinth, and as an oak, whose truncus remaineth, when they are cut down; so the sancta semen shall be the truncus thereof."
