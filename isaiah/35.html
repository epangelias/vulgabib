                    <p>The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them: and the desert shall rejoice, and the solitudo shall blossom as the rosa.</p>
<p>It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with gaudeo: the glory of Libanus shall be given unto it, the excellent beauty of Carmelus and Saron, they shall see the glory of the Lord, and the magnificentia of our God.</p>
<p>Strengthen the manus that are feeble, and confirm the genua that are weak.</p>
<p>Say to them that are of a fearful cor: Be comforted, fear not: behold, your God will come with vengeance, even God with a retributio to save you.</p>
<p>Then the oculi of caeci shall be opened, and the aures of surdi shall be unstopped.</p>
<p>Then shall the claudus leap as a cervus, and the lingua of the mutes shall sing: for in the desert shall waters flow, and the flumen in the solitudo.</p>
<p>And the miry place shall become a piscina of aqua: and the thirsty terra shall become fontes of aqua: in the habitation of dracones, where each lay, shall be an habitation of reeds and papyrus.</p>
<p>And an elevated via shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called the Via Sancta: the immundus shall not pass over it; but it shall be for those: the viatores, even the foolish, shall not err therein.</p>
<p>No leo shall be there, nor any of the ferocious bestiae shall go up thereon, it shall not be found there; but the redeemed shall walk there:</p>
<p>And the redempti of the Lord shall return, and come with laus to Sion; and eternal gaudeo shall be upon their caput: they shall obtain gaudeo and laus; and sorrow and suspirium shall flee away.</p>
