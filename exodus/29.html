                    <p>1 And this is the thing that thou shalt do unto them to hallow them, to minister unto me in the sacerdotium: Take one young vitulus, and two arietes, and one capra, and one agnus of the first year, for a holocaust.</p>
<p>2 And unleavened panis, and azyma tempered with oleum, and wafers unleavened anointed with oleum: of wheaten farina shalt thou make them.</p>
<p>3 And thou shalt put them in a canistrum, and shalt offer them in a canistrum before the Lord.</p>
<p>4 And thou shalt bring Aaron and his filii to the fores of the tabernaculum of the testimony, and shalt wash them with aqua.</p>
<p>5 And thou shalt take the vestes, and shalt vestire Aaron with the tunica, and the lineam vestem, and the ephod, and the pectoral, and shalt gird him with the cinctura of the ephod.</p>
<p>6 And thou shalt put the petasus upon his caput, and the coronam of sanctification upon the petasus.</p>
<p>7 And thou shalt take the oleum of unction, and shalt pour it upon his caput, and shalt anoint him.</p>
<p>8 And his filii thou shalt bring near, and shalt vestire them with tunicae,</p>
<p>9 And shalt gird them with cinctura, Aaron and his filii, and shalt put bonnets upon them, and the sacerdotium shall be theirs by a perpetual statute: and thou shalt fill the manus of Aaron and of his filii.</p>
<p>10 And thou shalt bring the vitulus before the tabernaculum of the testimony, and Aaron and his filii shall put their manus upon the caput of the vitulus.</p>
<p>11 And thou shalt mactare the vitulus before the Lord, in the fores of the tabernaculum of the testimony.</p>
<p>12 And thou shalt take of the sanguis of the vitulus, and shalt put it upon the cornua of the altare with thy finger, and shalt pour out all the sanguis at the base of the altare.</p>
<p>13 And thou shalt take all the adipem that covereth the intestina, and the lobe of the hepar, that is upon the ren, and the adipem that covereth the ren, and the two renes, and the adipem that is upon them, and shalt offer them in holocaustum upon the altare:</p>
<p>14 But the caro and the pellis and the fimum, thou shalt burn with ignis without the castra, it is pro peccato.</p>
<p>15 Thou shalt also take one of the arietes, and Aaron and his filii shall put their manus upon the caput of the aries:</p>
<p>16 And thou shalt mactare him, and shalt take of his sanguis, and shalt put it upon the cornua of the altare round about.</p>
<p>17 And thou shalt mactare the aries, and shalt divide him by his partes, and shalt wash his intestina and his pedes, and shalt put them upon the partes that are divided,</p>
<p>18 And shalt offer the whole aries in holocaustum upon the altare, it is a sweet odour to the Lord, it is a holocaustum of the Lord.</p>
<p>19 Thou shalt take also the other aries, and Aaron and his filii shall put their manus upon the caput of the aries:</p>
<p>20 And thou shalt mactare him, and shalt take of his sanguis, and shalt put it upon the auricem of Aaron, and of his filii, and upon the pollicem of their manus, and upon the pollex of their pedis, and shalt sprinkle the sanguis upon the altare round about.</p>
<p>21 And shalt take of the sanguis that is upon the altare, and of the oleum of unction, and shalt sprinkle upon Aaron, and upon his vestes, and upon his filii, and upon the vestes of his filii with him, and he shall be sanctified, and his vestes, and his filii, and the vestes of his filii with him.</p>
<p>22 And thou shalt take of the adipem of the ram, and the fat tail, and the adipem that covereth the intestina, and the lobe of the hepar, and the two renes, and the adipem that is upon them, and the right shoulder: for it is the ram of the consecratio.</p>
<p>23 And one loaf of bread, and one cake tempered with oleum, and one wafer out of the canistrum of unleavened bread, that is before the Lord:</p>
<p>24 And thou shalt put all these in the manus of Aaron, and in the manus of his filii, and shalt elevate them for a elevate-offering before the Lord.</p>
<p>25 And thou shalt take them from their manus, and shalt burn them in holocaustum upon the altare for a sweet odour before the Lord, it is a holocaustum of the Lord.</p>
<p>26 And thou shalt take the pectus of the ram of the consecratio, which is Aaron's, and shalt elevate it for a elevate-offering before the Lord, and it shall be thy parte.</p>
<p>27 And thou shalt sanctify the pectus of the elevation-offering, and the shoulder of the separation, which is separated from the ram of the consecratio, of that which is Aaron's, and of that which is his filii:</p>
<p>28 And it shall be for Aaron, and for his filii, by a statute for ever from the filii Israel, for it is a separate-offering: and it shall be a separate-offering from the filii Israel, of their hostias of peace-offerings, their separate-offering to the Lord.</p>
<p>29 And the vestes of the sacerdotium, that pertain to Aaron, shall be his filii's after him, to be anointed in them, and to fill their manus in them.</p>
<p>30 Seven dies shall the filius that succeedeth him in the sacerdotium, wear them, when he cometh into the tabernaculum of the testimony to minister in the sanctum.</p>
<p>31 And thou shalt take the ram of the consecratio, and shalt seethe his caro in a holy place.</p>
<p>32 And Aaron, and his filii, shall eat it with unleavened panis, in the fores of the tabernaculum of the testimony.</p>
<p>33 And they shall eat it, and be filled with it, and no alien shall eat it, because it is sanctified.</p>
<p>34 And if there remain of the caro of the consecratio, and of the panis, until the morning, thou shalt burn the remainder with ignis: it shall not be eaten, because it is sanctified.</p>
<p>35 All that I have commanded thee, thou shalt do unto Aaron, and unto his filii, and shalt consecrate them seven dies.</p>
<p>36 And thou shalt offer a vitulus for peccatum every day for expiation, and shalt purify the altare, when thou shalt offer the expiation for it, and shalt anoint it to sanctify it.</p>
<p>37 Seven dies shalt thou expiate the altare, and shalt sanctify it, and it shall be an altare of the greatest sanctification: and whatsoever toucheth the altare shall be sanctified.</p>
<p>38 This is what thou shalt offer upon the altare: Two arietes of a year old every day continually.</p>
<p>39 One aries in the morning, and the other aries in the vespers of the day:</p>
<p>40 With one aries, a tenth part of wheaten farina tempered with the fourth part of an hin of oleum, and the fourth part of a hin of vinum for a libation.</p>
<p>41 And the other aries thou shalt offer in the vespers of the day, according to the same rite, and according to the same oblation, as in the morning, for a most sweet odour, and for a holocaustum of the Lord.</p>
<p>42 It is a holocaustum of perpetual oblation, which was offered from the filii Israel before the fores of the tabernaculum of the testimony, in the fores of the Lord, where he spoke to Moses, saying: Speak to the filii Israel, and thou shalt say to them: Offer unto me the oblation of my holocaustum, and the sweet odour of your holocaustum, in their due seasons.</p>
<p>43 And thou shalt say to them: This is the holocaustum which you shall offer to the Lord: Two arietes of a year old every day, as a perpetual holocaustum.</p>
<p>44 One aries in the morning, and the other aries in the vespers of the day:</p>
<p>45 And a tenth part of wheaten farina tempered with the fourth part of an hin of oleum: and the fourth part of an hin of vinum for a libation.</p>
<p>46 And the other aries thou shalt offer in the vespers of the day, according to the same rite, and according to the same oblation, as in the morning for a most sweet odour, and for a holocaustum of the Lord.</p>
<p>47 It is a holocaustum of perpetual oblation, which was offered from the filii Israel before the fores of the tabernaculum of the testimony, in the fores of the Lord, where he spoke to Moses, saying: Speak to the filii Israel, and thou shalt say to them: Offer unto me the oblation of my holocaustum, and the sweet odour of your holocaustum, in their due seasons.</p>
<p>48 And thou shalt say to them: This is the holocaustum which you shall offer to the Lord: Two arietes of a year old every day, as a perpetual holocaustum.</p>
<p>49 And one aries in the morning, and the other aries in the vespers of the day:</p>
<p>50 And a tenth part of wheaten farina tempered with the fourth part of an hin of oleum: and the fourth part of an hin of vinum for a libation.</p>
<p>51 And the other aries thou shalt offer in the vespers of the day, according to the same rite, and according to the same oblation, as in the morning for a most sweet odour, and for a holocaustum of the Lord.</p>
<p>52 It is a holocaustum of perpetual oblation, which was offered from the filii Israel before the fores of the tabernaculum of the testimony, in the fores of the Lord, where he spoke to Moses, saying: Speak to the filii Israel, and thou shalt say to them: Offer unto me the oblation of my holocaustum, and the sweet odour of your holocaustum, in their due seasons.</p>
