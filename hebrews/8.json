  "I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee. Fear thou not, for I am with thee: and be not dismayed, for I am thy Deus.",
  "I will also be thy Deus, and thou shalt be my populus: for by my virtus, thou hast gotten the victoria.",
  "When Deus made a testament for the people, when He slew them in the wilderness, yet they obeyed not; but turned back, and tempted Deus, and limited the Sanctus Spiritus.",
  "For they provoked Him to anger with their actibus, and tempted Deus in their corde.",
  "And He said, They shall not enter into my requies, because they have tempted me, and have not believed my opera.",
  "For forty years I was grieved with this generatio, and said, It is a people that do err in their corde, and they have not known my viae.",
  "I said, They shall not enter into my requies, as I have sworn in my ira, if they shall enter into my requies, though they had seen my opera.",
  "For the Deus of the spiritus is not the Deus of the dead, but of the vivi.",
  "Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an pontifex, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Maiestas in the caelis;",
  "A Minister of the Sanctus, and of the verus Tabernaculum, which the Deus pitched, and not man.",
  "For every pontifex is ordained to offer giftas and sacrificia: wherefore it is of necessity that this pontifex also must have somewhat to offer.",
  "For if he were on earth, he would not be a pontifex, seeing that there are pontifices that offer giftas according to the lex;",
  "Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of Deus when he was about to make the Tabernaculum: for, See, saith He, that thou make all things according to the exemplar shewed to thee in the monte.",
  "But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministerium, by how much also he is the Mediator of a better testament, which was established upon better promissae."
