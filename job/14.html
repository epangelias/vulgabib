                    <p>Man that is born of a mulier, is of few dies, and full of miseria.</p>
<p>He cometh forth like a flos, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a umbra, and continueth not.</p>
<p>And doth thou open thine oculus upon such an one, and bringest me in judgment with thee?</p>
<p>Who can bring a mundus out of an immundus? not one.</p>
<p>That which is born of the carne, is carne; and that which is born of the Spiritus, is spiritus.</p>
<p>Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.</p>
<p>The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sonus thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spiritus.</p>
<p>Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?</p>
<p>Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a magister of Israel, and knowest not these things?</p>
<p>Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our testimonium.</p>
<p>If I have told you terrenum things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you caelestium things?</p>
<p>And no man hath ascendit up to caelum, but he that came down from caelum, even the Son of homo, which is in caelum.</p>
<p>And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desertum, so must the Son of homo be lifted up: That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have vitam aeternam.</p>
<p>For God so loved the mundus, that he gave his unigenitus Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have vitam aeternam.</p>
<p>For God sent not his Son into the mundus to condemn the mundus; but that the mundus through him might be saved.</p>
<p>He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the nomen of the only begotten Son of God.</p>
