  "And there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name was Micah.",
  "And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred shekels of argentum, which were taken from thee, about which thou cursedst, and spakest of also in mine aures: behold, the argentum is with me; I took it. And when his mater heard the words of her filius, which he spake unto her, her cor was glad.",
  "And he restored the eleven hundred shekels of argentum to his mater; and his mater said, I have sanctified the argentum unto the Lord out of mine hand for my filius, to make a sculptura, or a molten image. Now therefore I will restore it unto thee.",
  "Yet he restored the argentum unto his mater; and his mater took two hundred shekels of argentum, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a sculptura, or a molten image: and it was in the domus of Micah.",
  "And the domus of Micah was domus Dei, as long as the domus of God was in Shiloh.",
  "And in those dies, when there was no rex in Israel, every homo did that which was rectus in his own oculi.",
  "And there was a juvenile homo of Bethlehemjudah, of the familia of Judah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there.",
  "And the homo departed out of the urbs of Bethlehemjudah to sojourn where he could find a locus: and he came to mount Ephraim to the domus of Micah, as he journeyed.",
  "And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto him, I am a Levite of Bethlehemjudah, and I go to sojourn where I may find a locus.",
  "And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a pater and a sacerdos, and I will give thee ten shekels of argentum by the annum, and a veste to wear, and victus for thy animus: and the Levite went in.",
  "And the Levite was content to dwell with the homo; and the juvenile homo was unto him as one of his filii.",
  "And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the juvenile homo became his sacerdos, and was in the domus of Micah.",
  "Then said Micah, Now know I that the Lord will do me bonum, seeing I have a Levite to my sacerdos.",
  "In those dies there was no rex in Israel: every homo did that which was rectus in his own oculi.",
  "And there was a tribus of Danites, seeking their hereditas to dwell in; for unto that day all their hereditas had not fallen unto them among the tribus of Israel.",
  "And the filii of Dan sent of their familia five homines from their terminus, men of valour, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the terra, and to search it; and they said unto them, Go, search the terra: who when they came to mount Ephraim, to the domus of Micah, they lodged there.",
  "When they were by the domus of Micah, they knew the vox of the juvenile homo the Levite: and they turned in thither, and said unto him, Who brought thee hither? and what makest thou in this locus? and what hast thou here?",
  "And he said unto them, Thus and thus dealth Micah with me, and hath hired me, and I am his sacerdos.",
  "And they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God, that we may know whether our via shall be prospera.",
  "And the sacerdos said unto them, Go in pace: before the Lord is your via wherein ye go.",
  "Then the five homines departed, and came to Laish, and saw the populus thereof, how they dwelt after the manner of the Sidonians, quiet and secure; and there was no magistratus in the terra that might put them to shame in any thing; and they were far from the Sidonians, and had no commerce with any homo.",
  "And they came unto their fratres to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their fratres said unto them, What say ye?",
  "And they said, Arise, that we may go up against them: for we have seen the terra, and, behold, it is very bonum: and ye are still? be not slothful to go, and to enter to possess the terra.",
  "When ye go, ye shall come unto a populus secure, and to a terra spatiosa, and to a locus where there is no penuria of any thing that is in the terra, and ye shall be caput, and not tail.",
  "And there went from thence of the familia of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred homines appointed with armatura of war.",
  "And they went up, and pitched in Kirjathjearim, in Judah: wherefore they called that locus Mahanehdan unto this day: behold, it is behind Kirjathjearim.",
  "And they passed thence unto mount Ephraim, and came unto the domus of Micah.",
  "Then answered the five homines that went to spy out the terra of Laish, and said unto their fratres, Do ye know that there is in these domus an ephod, and teraphim, and a sculptura, and a molten image? now therefore consider what ye have to do.",
  "And they turned in thitherward, and came to the domus of the juvenile homo the Levite, even unto the domus of Micah, and saluted him.",
  "And the six hundred homines appointed with armatura of war, who were of the filii of Dan, stood by the entering of the porta.",
  "And the five homines that went to spy out the terra went up, and entered into Micah's domus, and fetched the sculptura, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image. Then said the sacerdos unto them, What do ye?",
  "And they said unto him, Hold thy peace, lay thy manus upon thy os, and go with us, and be to us a pater and a sacerdos: is it better for thee to be sacerdos unto the domus of one homo, or that thou be sacerdos to a tribus and a familia in Israel?",
  "And the cor of the sacerdos was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the sculptura, and went in the midst of the populus.",
  "So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the bestia and the carriage before them.",
  "And when they were a good way from the domus of Micah, the homines that were in the domus near to Micah's domus were gathered together, and overtook the filii of Dan.",
  "And they cried unto the filii of Dan. And they turned their facies, and said unto Micah, What aileth thee, that thou comest with such a company?",
  "And he said, Ye take my deos which I made, and the sacerdos, and go away: and what have I more? and what is this that ye say unto me, What aileth thee?",
  "And the filii of Dan said unto him, Let not thy vox be heard among us, lest angry homines run upon thee, and thou lose thy animus, and the animus of thy domus.",
  "And the filii of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back unto his domus.",
  "And they took the deos which Micah had made, and the sacerdos which he had, and came unto Laish, unto a populus quiet and secure: and they smote them with the oralis of the gladius, and burnt the urbs with ignis.",
  "And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Sidon, and they had no commerce with any homo: and it was in the vale that lieth by Bethrehob. And they built a urbs, and dwelt therein.",
  "And they called the nomine of the urbs Dan, after the nomine of Dan their pater, who was born unto Israel: howbeit the nomine of the urbs was Laish at the first.",
  "And the filii of Dan set up the sculptura: and Jonathan the filius of Gershom, the filius of Manasseh, he and his filii were sacerdotes to the tribus of Dan until the day of the captivitas of the terra.",
  "And they set them up Micah's sculptura, which he made, all the time that the domus of God was in Shiloh."
