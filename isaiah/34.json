  "Come near, ye gentes, and hear; yea, heathen, hearken: and know that the terra is at thy command.",
  "Who hath raised up one from the orient, whom he hath called in righteousness to his arm? He hath given the gentes before him, and made him ruler over reges.",
  "At his presence the gentes are shaken, he shall scatter the insulae of the terra, and shall make the montes and the colles plain.",
  "And the flumen shall be turned into crooked rivuli, and the pisciculi shall be dried up, because the flumen is dried up, and gone away.",
  "And the beast of the campo shall honour him, the sirpentes, and the flying avis of the caelum; for he hath given them to esca, and nourishment to every carne.",
  "They shall make war with thee, even from the tecta of the rocks, and of the hills; and with him shall make war from the montes of the terra.",
  "His weapon shall be prepared to devour them with venenum: and all the impii shall be dissolved: yea, as wax melteth before the ignis.",
  "And he shall consume with radice, and with folium, all the gentes.",
  "And this is known unto all the inhabitantes of the terra, and the inhabitants of the mundo: for he is a fortis Deus, and not a mendax Deus."
