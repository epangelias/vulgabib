                    <p>I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the **misericordia** of God, that ye present your bodies a living **sacrificium**, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.</p>
<p>And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, **voluntas** of God.</p>
<p>For I say, through the **gratia** given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of **fide**.</p>
<p>For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office: So we, being many, are one body in **Christus**, and every one members one of another.</p>
<p>Having then **gifts** differing according to the **gratia** that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of **fide**;</p>
<p>Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching; Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth **misericordia**, with cheerfulness.</p>
<p>Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.</p>
<p>Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another;</p>
<p>Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;</p>
<p>Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer;</p>
<p>Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to **hospitalitas**.</p>
<p>Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.</p>
<p>Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.</p>
<p>Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.</p>
<p>Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men.</p>
<p>If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.</p>
<p>Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.</p>
<p>Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with **bonum**.</p>
