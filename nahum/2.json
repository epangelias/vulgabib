  "He that dasheth in pieces is come up before thy face: keep the munition, watch the way, fortify thy loins, fortify thy power mightily. 1",
  "For the Lord hath turned away the excellency of Jacob, as the excellenciae of Israel: for the emptiers have emptied them out, and marred their vine branches. 2",
  "The shield of his valiant men is made red, the valiant men are in scarlet: the chariots shall be with flaming torches in the day of his preparation, and the cedars shall be terribly shaken. 3",
  "The chariot shall rage in the streets, they shall justle one against another in the broad ways: they shall seem like torches, they shall run like the fulgur. 4",
  "He shall recount his honourable men: they shall stumble in their walk; they shall make haste to the wall thereof, and the defence shall be prepared. 5",
  "The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the palatium shall be dissolved. 6",
  "And Huzzab shall be led away captive, she shall be brought up, and her maids shall lead her as with the voice of columbae, beating upon their breasts. 7",
  "But Nineve is of old like a piscina of water: yet they shall flee away. Stand, stand, shall they cry; but while they are fleeing away they shall look back. 8",
  "Take ye the spoil of silver, take the spoil of aurum: for there is no end of the store, the glory of all pleasant furniture. 9",
  "She is empty, and void, and waste: and the heart melteth, and the knees smite together, and much pain is in all loins, and the faces of them all gather blacknesses. 10"
