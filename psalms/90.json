  "A Prayer of Moses the man of Deus. Domine, thou hast been our habitatio from generation to generation.",
  "Before the montes were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the terra and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art Deus.",
  "Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Returne, ye filii hominum.",
  "For a mille anni are in thy sight but as yesterday when it is past, and as a vigilia in the night.",
  "Thou carriest them away as with a flumen they are as a somnium, as gramine that groweth in the morning.",
  "In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it is cut down, and withereth.",
  "For we are consumsed by thy furor, and by thy ira are we troubled.",
  "Thou hast set our iniquitates before thee, our secreti are in the light of thy facies.",
  "For all our dies are passed away in thy ira: we spend our anni as a sermonem.",
  "The dies of our anni are threescore anni and ten; and if by reason of fortitudo they be fourscore anni, yet is their strength labor and dolor: for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.",
  "Who knoweth the potestatem of thy ira? even according to thy timor, so is thy furor.",
  "So teach us to numerare our dies, that we may applicare our corda unto sapientia.",
  "Turne thou us againe, O Deus of hostes; and cause thy facies to shine; that we may be salvati.",
  "Make us glad according to the dies wherein thou hast afflictus us, and the anni wherein we have seen malum.",
  "Let thy opera appear unto thy servi, and thy gloria in their filii.",
  "And let the gratia of the Domine nostri Deus be upon us; and establish thou the opera of our manus upon us; yea, the opera of our manos establish thou it.",
  "O satisfy us in the matutino with thy misericordia; that we may rejoice and be glad all our dies.",
  "Make us glad according to the dies wherein thou hast afflictus us, and the anni wherein we have seen malum."
