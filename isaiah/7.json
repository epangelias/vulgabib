  "Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, butyrum et mel comedet, ut sciat reprobare malum, et eligere bonum.",
  "For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings, quia antequam sciat puer reprobare malum, et eligere bonum, derelicta erit terra, quam odisti, a facie duorum regum suorum.",
  "The LORD shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon thy father's house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah; even the king of Assyria, adducet Dominus super te, et super populum tuum, et super domum patris tui, dies, quae non venerunt, a die qua recessit Ephraim a Juda, regem Assyriorum.",
  "And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, et erit in die illa, quod sibilet Dominus muscae, quae est in extremo fluminum Aegypti,",

  "In the same day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired, namely, by them beyond the river, by the king of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet, and it shall also consume the beard, in eadem die radet Dominus novacula conducta, scilicet, per transfluvianos, per regem Assyriorum, caput, et pilos pedum, et barbam consumet.",
  "And it shall come to pass in that day, that a man shall nourish a young cow, and two sheep, et erit in die illa, quod nutriet homo vaccam juvenem, et duas oves.",
  "And it shall come to pass, for the abundance of milk that they shall give he shall eat butter, for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the land, et erit, propter abundantiam lactis, quod dabunt, comedet butyrum, butyrum et mel comedet omnis, qui relictus fuerit in medio terrae.",
  "And it shall come to pass in that day, every place shall be, where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings, it shall even be for briers and thorns, et erit in die illa, omnis locus, ubi erant mille vites, pro mille argenteos, erunt in spinas, et in vepres.",
  "With arrows and with bows shall men come thither, because all the land shall become briers and thorns, cum sagittis, et arcu venient illuc, quia in spinas et vepres erit omnis terra.",
  "And all hills that shall be digged with the mattock, there shall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns, but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen, and for the treading of lesser cattle, et omnes colles, qui cum ligone fodientur, non veniet illuc timor spinarum, et veprium, sed erunt in emissione boum, et in calcamentum minoris pecoris."
