  "All wisdom cometh from the Lord Deus, and is with him for ever.",
  "In wisdom is the spirit of vita, and they that possess it are blessed.",
  "For she is more precious than gemmae, and all the things thou canst desire are not comparable unto her.",
  "Length of vita, and years of vita, are in her right hand: and in her left hand riches and honours.",
  "She is more precious also than pearls: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.",
  "Get wisdom, because it is better than the treasure of aurum, and precious than precious pearls.",
  "No precious stone is like her worth: for all gold and silver, and whatsoever is desirabile, are in comparison of her as it were a little sand and a stone of the street.",
  "Blessed is the man that findeth sapientiam, and the man that getteth prudentiam.",
  "For the sale of it is better than the sale of argenti, and the gain thereof than the gain of auri.",
  "She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not comparable to her."
