                    <p>Pilatus therefore took Jesus, and scourged him, with flagellis.</p>
<p>And the soldiers plaited a corona of thorns, and put it on his caput, and they put on him a purple garment, and said, Hail, Rex of the Judaei!</p>
<p>And they came to him, and said, Hail, Rex of the Judaei! and they gave him a basium.</p>
<p>Pilatus therefore went out again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no culpa in him.</p>
<p>Then came Jesus forth, wearing the corona of thorns, and the purple garment: and Pilatus saith unto them, Ecce Homo!</p>
<p>When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucifige, crucifige him. Pilatus saith unto them, Take ye him, and crucify him: for I find no culpa in him.</p>
<p>The Judaei answered him, We have a lex, and by our lex he ought to die, because he made se ipse Filius Dei.</p>
<p>When Pilatus therefore heard that saying, he was the more metus: and going into the hall of judgment he saith unto Jesus, Unde es tu? But Jesus gave him no responsio.</p>
<p>Then saith Pilatus unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have potestas to crucify thee, and have potestas to release thee?</p>
<p>Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no potestas at all against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater peccatum.</p>
<p>From thenceforth Pilatus sought to release him: but the Judaei cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar's friend: whosoever maketh himself Rex, speaketh against Caesar.</p>
<p>When Pilatus therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the tribunal in the place that is called Lithostrotos, but in the Hebrew tongue Gabbatha.</p>
<p>And it was the parasceve of the pascha, and about the sexta hora: and he saith unto the Judaei, Ecce Rex vester!</p>
<p>But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him. Pilatus saith unto them, Shall I crucify your Rex? The chief priests answered, We have no rex but Caesar.</p>
<p>Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him away.</p>
<p>And he bearing his crux went forth into a place called Calvaria, but in Hebrew Golgotha:</p>
<p>Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.</p>
<p>And Pilatus wrote a titulus, and put it on the crux. And the writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE REX OF THE JUDAEI.</p>
<p>This titulus then read many of the Judaei: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the civitas: and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin.</p>
<p>Then said the chief priests of the Judaei to Pilatus, Write not, The Rex of the Judaei; but that he said, I am Rex of the Judaei.</p>
<p>Pilatus answered, What I have written I have written.</p>
<p>Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his vestes, and made four partes, to every soldier a parte; and also his tunic, which was without seam, woven from the top throughout.</p>
<p>They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the Scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my vestes among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.</p>
<p>Now there stood by the crux of Jesus his mater, and his mater's soror, Maria the wife of Cleophas, and Maria Magdalene.</p>
<p>When Jesus therefore saw his mater, and the discipulus standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mater, Mulier, behold thy filius!</p>
<p>Then saith he to the discipulus, Behold thy mater! And from that hora that discipulus took her unto his own domus.</p>
<p>After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now consummated, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst.</p>
<p>Now there was set a vas full of acetum: and they filled a spunge with acetum, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his os.</p>
<p>When Jesus therefore had received the acetum, he said, Consummatum est: and he bowed his caput, and gave up the spirit.</p>
<p>The Judaei therefore, because it was the parasceve, that the bodies should not remain upon the crux on the sabbatum, (for that sabbatum was a great dies,) besought Pilatus that their ossa might be broken, and that they might be taken away.</p>
<p>Then came the soldiers, and brake the ossa of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him.</p>
<p>But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was already mortuus, they brake not his ossa:</p>
<p>For these things were done, that the Scripture should be fulfilled, A os non comminuetis ex eo.</p>
<p>And again another Scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.</p>
<p>And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a discipulus of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Judaei, besought Pilatus that he might take away the corpus of Jesus: and Pilatus gave him leave. He came therefore, and took the corpus of Jesus.</p>
<p>And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by nocte, and brought a mixture of myrrha and aloes, about an hundred pound weight.</p>
<p>Then took they the corpus of Jesus, and wound it in linteis with the aromata, as the manner of the Judaei is to bury.</p>
<p>Now in the place where he was crucified there was a hortus; and in the hortus a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid.</p>
<p>There laid they Jesus therefore because of the parasceve of the Judaei; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand.</p>
