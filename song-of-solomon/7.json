  "How beautiful are thy feet with shoes, O prince's daughter! the joints of thy thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a cunning workman.",
  "Thy navel is like a round goblet, which wanteth not liquor: thy belly is like an heap of wheat set about with lilies.",
  "Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins, Amor tuus est sicut vitis in flore, thy neck is as a tower of ivory; thine eyes like the fishpools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bathrabbim: thy nose is as the tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus.",
  "Thine head upon thee is like Carmel, and the hair of thy head like purple; the king is held in the galleries.",
  "How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights!",
  "This thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to clusters of grapes.",
  "I said, I will go up to the palm tree, I will take hold of the boughs thereof: now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine, and the smell of thy nose like apples;",
  "And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for my beloved, that goeth down sweetly, causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak.",
  "I am my beloved's; and his desire is toward me.",
  "Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge in the villages.",
  "Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine flourish, whether the tender grape appear, and the pomegranates bud forth: there will I give thee my loves.",
  "The mandrakes give a smell, and at our gates are all manner of pleasant fruits, new and old, which I have laid up for thee, O my beloved.",
  "O that thou wert as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my mother! when I should find thee without, I would kiss thee; yea, I would not be despised.",
  "I would lead thee, and bring thee into my mother's house, who would instruct me: I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate:",
  "His left hand should be under my head, and his right hand should embrace me.",
  "I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, till he please.",
  "Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, like pillars of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all powders of the merchant?",
  "Behold his bed, which is Solomon's; threescore valiant men are about it, of the valiant of Israel.",
  "They all hold swords, being expert in war: every man hath his sword upon his thigh because of fear in the night.",
  "King Solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of Lebanon.",
  "He made the pillars thereof of silver, the bottom thereof of gold, the covering of it of purple, the midst thereof being paved with love for the daughters of Jerusalem.",
  "Go forth, O ye daughters of Zion, and behold king Solomon with the crown wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart."
