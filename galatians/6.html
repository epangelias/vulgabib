                    <p>Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spirituales, restore such an one in the spirit of lenitas, considering thyself, lest thou also be temptatus.</p>
<p>Bear ye one another's onera. For also Christ gratias agere did not to himself, but to God.</p>
<p>For every man shall bear his own onus.</p>
<p>Let him that is doctrinam doctus in the word, communicare in all good things with him that doctorem doth.</p>
<p>Be not deceived; God is not ludificandus: for whatsoever a man seminat, that shall he also metere.</p>
<p>For he that seminat in his carne, of the carne shall reap corruptio; but he that seminat in Spiritu, of the Spiritu shall reap vitam aeternam.</p>
<p>And let us not fatigari in benefaciendo: for in tempore suo, we shall metere, if we faint not.</p>
<p>As we therefore have occasio, let us operam dare to do bonum unto all men, especially unto those who are of the familia fidei.</p>
<p>Ye see how large a litera I have written unto you with mine own manus.</p>
<p>As many as desire to make a fair shew in carne, they constrain you to circumcidi, only lest they should persecutio suffer for the crucis Christi.</p>
<p>For neither they themselves who are circumcisi keep the legem, but desire to have you circumcisi, that they may gloriari in your carne.</p>
<p>But God forbid that I should gloriari, save in the cruce Domini nostri Iesu Christi, per quem mundus est crucifixus mihi, et ego mundo.</p>
<p>For in Christo Iesu neither circumcisio availet aliquid, neque praeputium, sed nova creatura.</p>
<p>And as many as walk according to this regulam, pax et misericordia super illos, et super Israel Dei.</p>
<p>From henceforth let no man dare to me molestare: for I bear in corpore meo stigmata Domini Iesu.</p>
<p>Brethren, the gratia Domini nostri Iesu Christi be with your spirit. Amen.</p>
