                    <p>But of the times and the seasons, brevitas (shortness) and the instant, brethren, ye have no necessitas (need) that I write unto you.</p>
<p>For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Dominus (Lord) so cometh as a thief in noctem (night).</p>
<p>When they shall say, Pax (peace) and tranquililitas (safety); then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escapere (escape).</p>
<p>But ye, brethren, are not in tenebrae (darkness), that that day should overtake you as a thief.</p>
<p>Ye are all the filii (children) of lucem (light), and the filii (children) of the diei (day): we are not of noctem (night), nor of tenebrae (darkness).</p>
<p>Therefore let us not dormire (sleep), as do others; but let us vigilia (watch) and be sobrii (sober).</p>
<p>For they that dormiunt (sleep) dormiunt noctu (sleep by night); and they that ebrii (are drunken) are ebrii noctu (are drunken by night).</p>
<p>But let us, who are of the diei (day), be sobrii (sober), putting on the loricam (breastplate) of fides (faith) and amoris (love); and for an helmet, the spem (hope) of salvation.</p>
<p>For God hath not appointed us to iram (wrath), but to obtain salutem (salvation) by our Dominus (Lord) Jesus Christ,</p>
<p>Who died for us, that, whether we wake or dormiamus (sleep), we should live together with him.</p>
<p>Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edificate (edify) one another, even as also ye do.</p>
<p>And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Dominus (Lord), and admonish you;</p>
<p>And to esteem them very highly in amoris (love) for their opera (work's) sake. And be at pax (peace) among yourselves.</p>
<p>Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the fideles (faithful), support the infirmos (weak), be patient towards all men.</p>
<p>See that none render malum (evil) for malum (evil); but ever follow that which is bonum (good), both among yourselves, and to all men.</p>
<p>Rejoice evermore.</p>
<p>Pray without cessatio (ceasing).</p>
<p>In omnibus gratias agite (in everything give thanks): for this is the voluntas (will) of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.</p>
<p>Quench not the Spirit.</p>
<p>Despise not propheticum (prophecies).</p>
<p>Prove all things; hold fast that which is bonum (good).</p>
<p>Abstain from all malum (evil).</p>
<p>The Deus (God) of pax (peace) sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and anima (soul) and corpus (body) be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Dominus (Lord) Jesus Christ.</p>
