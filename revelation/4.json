  "After these things I looked, and behold, a door was opened in caelum, and the voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be done hereafter.",
  "And immediately I was in the Spirit: and behold, a throne was set in caelum, and one sat on the throne.",
  "And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone: and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald.",
  "And round about the throne were four and twenty sedes, and upon the sedes I saw four and twenty anciani sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their capita crowns of aurum.",
  "And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices: and there were seven lampades of ignis burning before the throne, which are the seven Spiritus of Deus.",
  "And before the throne there was a sea of vitrum like unto cristallum: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four animalia full of oculi before and behind.",
  "And the four animalia had each of them six alas; and they were full of oculi within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Sanctus, Sanctus, Sanctus, Dominus Deus Omnipotens, who was, and is, and is to come."
