  "Praise the Dominus. I will give thanks unto the Dominus with my whole cor, in the assembly of the recti, and in the congregation.",
  "The works of the Dominus are great, sought out of all them that have delectation therein.",
  "His opera is honour and magnificentia: and his iustitia endureth for ever.",
  "He hath made his mirabilia to be remembered: the Dominus is gratia and misericordia.",
  "He hath given alimentum to them that timor the Dominus: he will ever be mindful of his testamentum.",
  "He hath shewed his populus the potentiam of his opera, that he may give them the hereditas of the gentes.",
  "The opera of his manus are veritas and iustitia; all his mandata are fidelia.",
  "They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in veritas and rectitudine.",
  "He sent redemptio unto his populus: he hath commandatum his foedus for ever: sanctus and terribilis is his Nomen.",
  "Initium sapientiae is timor Domini: a prudentibus qui faciunt iudicium: laus eius manet in saeculum saeculi."
