  "And Benhadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together: and there were thirty and two kings with him, and horses, and chariots: and he went up and besieged Samaria, and warred against it.",
  "And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city, and said unto him, Thus saith Benhadad, Thy argentum and thy aurum is mine; thy uxor and thy filii, the best, are mine.",
  "And the king of Israel answered and said, My dominus, O king, according to thy verbum, I am thine, and all that I have.",
  "And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaketh Benhadad, saying, Although I have sent unto thee, saying, Thou shalt deliver me thy argentum, and thy aurum, and thy uxor, and thy filii;",
  "Yet I will send my servos unto thee to morrow about this hora, and they shall search thine domus, and the domus of thy servos; and it shall be, that whatsoever is delectus in thine oculi, they shall put it in their manus, and take it away.",
  "Then the king of Israel called all the senatores of the land, and said, Mark, I pray you, and see how this homo seeketh mischief against us: for he sent unto me for my uxor, and for my filii, and for my argentum, and for my aurum; and I denied him not.",
  "And all the senatores and all the populus said unto him, Hearken not unto him, nor consent.",
  "Wherefore he said unto the messengers of Benhadad, Tell my dominus the king, All that thou didst send for to thy servus at the first I will do: but this thing I may not do. And the messengers departed, and brought him word again.",
  "And Benhadad sent unto him, and said, The dei do so unto me, and more also, if the pulvis of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the populus that follow me.",
  "And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell him, Let not him that girdeth his balteus boast himself as he that putteth it off.",
  "And it came to pass, when Benhadad heard this message, as he was drinking, he and the reges in the tabernacula, that he said unto his servos, Set yourselves in array. And they set themselves in array against the city.",
  "And, behold, there came a propheta unto Ahab king of Israel, saying, Thus saith Deus, Hast thou seen all this great multitude? behold, I will deliver it into thine manus this day; and thou shalt know that I am Deus.",
  "And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus saith Deus, By the juvenes of the provinciae. Then he said, Who shall order the battle? And he answered, Thou.",
  "Then he numbered the juvenes of the provinciae, and they were two hundred and thirty two: and after them he numbered all the populus, even all the filii of Israel, being seven thousand.",
  "And they went out at noon. But Benhadad was drinking himself drunk in the tabernacula, he and the reges, the thirty and two reges that helped him.",
  "And the juvenes of the provinciae went out first; and Benhadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There are homines come out of Samaria.",
  "And he said, Whether they be come out for pacem, take them alive; or whether they be come out for bellum, take them alive.",
  "So these juvenes of the provinciae came out of the city, and the exercitus which followed them.",
  "And they slew every unus of his homines that they found; and Benhadad fled, and he and the reges that helped him fled into the city, into the tabernacula.",
  "And one of the juvenes said unto another, I will strike the king of Syria. And he said, Thou shalt not strike him: for the reges are like the prophetae.",
  "And the king of Syria commanded the capitanei of his currus, saying, Fight neither with parvus nor great, save only with the king of Israel.",
  "And it came to pass, when the capitanei of the currus saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely this is the king of Israel. And they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out.",
  "And it came to pass, when the capitanei of the currus saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.",
  "And a unus man drew a arcus at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the loricam and the balteus: wherefore he said unto the cursor of his currus, Turn thine manus, and carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.",
  "And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his currus against the Syrians, and died at even: and the sanguis ran out of the vulnus into the midst of the currus.",
  "And there went a rumour throughout the exercitus about the going down of the sol, saying, Every unus to his civitas, and every unus to his terra.",
  "And the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried him in Samaria.",
  "And one washed the currus in the fons of Samaria; and the canes licked up his sanguis; and they washed his armor; according unto the verbum of Deus which he spake.",
  "Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the domus of ivory which he made, and all the civitates that he built, are they not written in the libro of the chronicles of the reges of Israel?",
  "So Ahab slept with his patres; and Ahaziah his filius reigned in his stead.",
  "And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah began to reign in the anno of Ahab king of Israel, in the vigesimo quinto anno of his reign.",
  "He was triginta quintus anni when he began to reign, and reigned five anni in Jerusalem. And his mater's name was Azubah filia of Shilhi.",
  "And he walked in omni via of Asa his pater, and declined not from it, doing that which was rectus in the oculi of Deus: nevertheless the excelsa he took not away; for the populus sacrificavit and burnt incense yet in the excelsa.",
  "And Jehoshaphat had pacem with the king of Israel."
