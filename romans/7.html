                    <p>Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the lex, how that the lex hath dominion over a homo, as long as he liveth?</p>
<p>For the mulier which hath a vir, is bound by the lex to that vir so long as he liveth; but if the vir be dead, she is freed from the lex of that vir.</p>
<p>So then if, while her vir liveth, she be married to another vir, she shall be called an adultera: but if her vir be dead, she is free from that lex; so that she is no adultera, though she be married to another vir.</p>
<p>Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become mortui to the lex by the corpus of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the mortui, that we should bring forth fructus unto Deus.</p>
<p>For when we were in the carne, the passiones of peccata, which were by the lex, did work in our membra to bring forth fructus unto mors.</p>
<p>But now we are delivered from the lex, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in novusness of spirit, and not in the vetusness of the littera.</p>
<p>What shall we say then? Is the lex peccatum? Deus forbid. Nay, I had not known peccatum, but by the lex: for I had not known concupiscentia, except the lex had said, Thou shalt not concupiscere.</p>
<p>But peccatum, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all kinds of concupiscentia. For without the lex peccatum was mortuum.</p>
<p>For I was alive without the lex once: but when the commandment came, peccatum revived, and I mortuus.</p>
<p>And the commandment, which was ordained to vita, I found to be unto mors.</p>
<p>For peccatum, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.</p>
<p>Wherefore the lex is sanctus, and the commandment sanctus, and justus, and bonus.</p>
<p>Was then that which is bonus made mors unto me? Deus forbid. But peccatum, that it might appear peccatum, working mors in me by that which is bonus; that peccatum by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.</p>
<p>For we know that the lex is spiritus: but I am carnis, sold under peccatum.</p>
<p>For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.</p>
<p>If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the lex that it is bonus.</p>
<p>Now then it is no more I that do it, but peccatum that dwelleth in me.</p>
<p>For I know that in me (that is, in my carne,) dwelleth no bonus thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is bonus I find not.</p>
<p>For the bonus that I would I do not: but the malus which I would not, that I do.</p>
<p>Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but peccatum that dwelleth in me.</p>
<p>I find then a lex, that, when I would do bonus, peccatum is present with me.</p>
<p>For I delight in the lex of Deus after the inward homo:</p>
<p>But I see another lex in my membra, warring against the lex of my mens, and bringing me into captivitatem to the lex of peccati which is in my membra.</p>
<p>O wretched homo that I am! who shall deliver me from the corpus of this mors?</p>
<p>I thank Deus through Iesus Christus our Dominus. So then with the mens I myself serve the lex of Deus; but with the carne the lex of peccati.</p>
