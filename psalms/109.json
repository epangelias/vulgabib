  "Hold not thy peace, O Deus meus, for the os of the malus and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me:",
  "They have spoken against me with lingua that is dolosus:",
  "They compassed me about also with verba odiosi, and fought against me without causa.",
  "For my amor they are adversarii mei: but I ora for them:",
  "And they have rendered me malum pro bono, and odium pro dilectio:",
  "Set thou malus over him: and let Satanas stand at his dexter manus.",
  "When he shall be iudicatus, let him be condemnatus: and let his oratio become peccatum:",
  "Let his dies be pauci: and let another take his episcopatus:",
  "Let his filii be orphani, and his uxor vidua:",
  "Let his filii be vagabundi, and beg for panem: and let them be ejected from their domus desolata:",
  "Let the fenerator be vigilant over all that he hath: and let alieni despoil him of his labor:",
  "Let there be none to extend unto him misericordia: neither let there be any to have pietas upon his orphani:",
  "Let his nomen be deletus from the libellus of the vivi: and let him not be recorded with the iusti:",
  "Let his dies be exigui: and in the same let his nomen be deletus:",
  "He hath not regarded to concitare maledicta in me: and therefore let maledicta be in conspectu eius:",
  "As he delighted in maledicere, so let it come unto him: and as he loved not benedictio, so let it be far from him:",
  "As he was clothed with maledictio like a vestis: so let it come into his interiora like aqua: and like oleum in ossa eius:",
  "Let it be unto him as the vestis which covereth him: and for the cinctura wherewith he is girt about:",
  "Let this be the iudicium of them that iudicate me: and of them that speak malum against me:",
  "But deal thou with me, O Deus Domine, according to thy nomen: because thy misericordia is bonus:",
  "Quia I am pauper and indigens: and my cor is wounded within me:",
  "I am gone like umbra simulacri: and I am shaken off as locusta:",
  "My genua are debilia through ieiunium: and my caro is destituta of pinguedo:",
  "I became also a opprobrium unto them: they looked upon me, and they shaked their capita:",
  "Help me, O Deus Domine: and salvare me for thy misericordia:",
  "Et sciunt quod hoc est manus tua: et quod tu, Domine, fecisti illud:",
  "Maledicta illi qui maledixerunt mihi: sed qui benedicunt te, erunt salvati:",
  "Qui iudicate vos in me, exsultabunt: et super me loquentur lingua: Omnes qui viderunt me, deriserunt me:"
