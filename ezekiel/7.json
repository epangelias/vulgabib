  "And the word of the Dominus came unto me, saying,",
  "Also, thou son of man, thus saith the Dominus Deus; An end, the end is come upon the terra of Israel;",
  "An end, I will send mine ira upon thee, and I will judge thee according to thy via, and will recompense upon thee all thine abomination.",
  "And mine oculus shall not spare thee, neither will I have misericordia: but I will recompense thy via upon thee, and thine abomination shall be in the midst of thee: and ye shall know that I am the Dominus.",
  "Thus saith the Dominus Deus; An affliction, one affliction, behold, it cometh.",
  "An end is come, the end is come: it watcheth for thee; behold, it is come.",
  "The pax is departed from the terra, and gaudium and laetitia out of the orbis terrarum.",
  "Now will I shortly pour out my furor upon thee, and accomplish mine ira upon thee: and I will judge thee according to thy via, and will recompense thee for all thine abomination.",
  "Neither shall mine oculus spare, neither will I have misericordia: I will recompense thee according to thy via and thine abomination that are in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I am the Dominus that smiteth.",
  "Behold the dies, behold, it is come: the morning is gone forth; the virga is sprung forth, the arrogant one hath risen up:",
  "Violentia is risen up into a virga of wickedness: there is none of them, nor of their multitude, nor of any of theirs: neither is there wailing for them.",
  "The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn: for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.",
  "For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they were yet alive: for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof, which shall not return; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his vita.",
  "They have blown the buccina, even to make all ready; but none goeth to the battle: for my indignatio is upon all the multitude thereof.",
  "The gladius is without, and the pestis and the fames within: he that is in the ager, he shall die by the gladius; and he that is in the urbs, famine and pestis shall devour him.",
  "But they that escape of them shall escape, and shall be on the montes like the columbae of the valles, all of them mourning, every one for his iniquitas.",
  "All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak as water:",
  "They shall also gird themselves with sackcloth, and horror shall cover them; and shame shall be upon all faces, and baldness upon all their heads.",
  "They shall cast their argentum in the strata, and their aurum shall be removed: their argentum and their aurum shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the indignatio of the Dominus: they shall not satisfy their appetitum, nor fill their ventres: because it is made the stumblingblock of their iniquitas.",
  "As for the beauty of his ornatus, he set it in majesty: but they made images of their abomination and of their detestable things in it: therefore have I set it far from them.",
  "And I will give it into the manu of the extraneus for spoil, and to the wicked of the terra for robbery, and they shall pollute it.",
  "I will turn my facies from them, and they shall pollute my sanctuarium: for they have filled it with violence and blood; and I will make it gross with them.",
  "And for the iniquity of the terra, I will make it desolate, that it may be gross with them.",
  "This is the dies whereof I have spoken: and it shall come to pass in the urbs that is in Israel, saith the Dominus Deus; and it shall be the morning after the dies of the affliction.",
  "The word of the Dominus came unto me in the morning after the dies of the affliction, saying,",
  "Surely it cometh, and he shall know it, he that escapeth in that dies: the voice of their clamor is come to the auris of the Dominus Deus."
