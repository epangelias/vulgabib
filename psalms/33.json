  "Rejoice in the Domine, ye righteous; for praise is comely for the rectus.",
  "Praise the Domine with harp: sing unto him with the psalterium and an instrument of decem chordis.",
  "Sing unto him a novum canticum: play skilfully with a loud noise.",
  "For the verbum Domini is rectus, and all his opera are in veritas.",
  "He loveth justitiam and judicium: the terra is full of the benignitas Domini.",
  "By the verbum Domini the caeli were made; and all the host of them by the spiritus oris ejus.",
  "He gathereth the aquae of the mari as an heap: he layeth up the abyssa in repositories.",
  "Let all the terra fear the Domine: let all the inhabitants of the mundus stand in awe of him.",
  "For he spake, and it was factum: he commanded, and it stood.",
  "The Domine bringeth the consilium of the gentes to nought: he maketh the cogitationes of the populorum to none effect.",
  "The consilium Domini standeth for ever, the cogitationes of his corde to all generations.",
  "Blessed is the gens cuius Deus is the Domine; and the populus whom he hath chosen for hereditas sua.",
  "The Domine looketh from caelo: he beholdeth all the filii hominum.",
  "From the loco of his habitatio he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the terra.",
  "He fashioneth their corda singly; he understandeth all their opera.",
  "There is no rex saved by the multitudo of his exercitus: a potens vir is not delivered by the multitudo of his fortitudo.",
  "A equus is a vana spes for salvus: neither shall he deliver any by his magna fortitudo.",
  "Behold, the oculus Domini is upon them that fear him, upon them that sperant in his benignitas;",
  "To deliver their anima from morte, and to preserve them in fame.",
  "Our anima waiteth for the Domine: he is our adjutor and our scutum.",
  "Yea, our cor shall rejoice in him, because we have speratum in his sancto nomine.",
  "Let thy benignitas, Domine, be upon us, according as we speramus in te."
