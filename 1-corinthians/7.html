                    <p>Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: It is good for a man not to touch a mulier,</p>
<p>Nevertheless, to avoid fornicatio, let every man have his own uxor, and let every woman have her own vir.</p>
<p>Let the uxor render unto her vir due benevolentia: and likewise also the vir unto the uxor.</p>
<p>The uxor hath not potestas of her own corpus, but the vir: and likewise also the vir hath not potestas of his own corpus, but the uxor.</p>
<p>Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to oratio; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinentia.</p>
<p>But I speak this by indulgentia, not by imperium.</p>
<p>For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath his proper donum of Deus, one after this manner, and another after that.</p>
<p>I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is bonum for them if they abide even as I.</p>
<p>But if they cannot continentiam, let them nubere: for it is better to nubere than to ardere.</p>
<p>And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Dominus, Let not the uxor be separated from her vir:</p>
<p>But and if she be separated, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her vir: and let not the vir put away his uxor.</p>
<p>But to the rest speak I, not the Dominus: If any frater hath a uxor that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.</p>
<p>And the woman which hath an vir that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.</p>
<p>For the unbelieving vir is sanctified by the uxor, and the unbelieving uxor is sanctified by the vir: else were your filii unclean; but now are they sancti.</p>
<p>For what knowest thou, O mulier, whether thou shalt salus facere virum? or how knowest thou, O vir, whether thou shalt salus facere uxorem?</p>
<p>But as Deus hath distributed to every man, as the Dominus hath called every one, so let him walk. And so ordino in all ecclesiis.</p>
<p>Is any man called being circumcisus? let him not obliterare circumcisionem. Is any called in praeputio? let him not be circumcisus.</p>
<p>Circumcisio is nothing, and praeputio is nothing, but keeping the mandata Dei.</p>
<p>Let every man abide in the same vocatio wherein he was called.</p>
<p>Art thou called being servus? care not for it: but if thou mayest be made liber, use it rather.</p>
<p>For he that is called in the Dominus, being servus, is liberum hominem Domino: likewise also he that is called being liber, is servus Christi.</p>
<p>Ye are bought with a pretium; be not servi hominum.</p>
<p>Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with Deus.</p>
