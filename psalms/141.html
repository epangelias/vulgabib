                    <p>Lord, I cry unto thee: make haste unto me; give ear unto my voice, when I cry unto thee.</p>
<p>Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incensum, and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrificium.</p>
<p>Set a watch, O Lord, before my os; keep the portam of my lips.</p>
<p>Incline not my cor to any malum thing, to practise wicked works with homines who work iniquitas: and let me not eat of their deliciae.</p>
<p>Let the Justus smite me, it shall be a gratia: and let him reprove me, it shall be as oleum on the caput; for yet my oratio shall be of their malitia.</p>
<p>Their judices are overthrown by the sides of the fossa, they shall hear my verba; for they are suavis.</p>
<p>Our bones are scattered at the os of the sepulchrum, as when one cutteth and cleaveth wood upon the terra.</p>
<p>But mine oculi are unto thee, O Deus, my Lord: in thee is my fiducia; leave not my anima destitute.</p>
<p>Keep me from the laqueus that they have laid for me, and the fossa of the operarii; hide me from the congregation of the malignant.</p>
<p>Let the Justi expectare in the porta of the sepulchrum, and let them rejoice in the veritas; let them sing and laudare thy misericordia and veritas; for thou hast magnified thy bonitas above the caelum.</p>
