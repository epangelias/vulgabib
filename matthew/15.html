                    <p>Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, qui erant de Ierusalem, saying,</p>
<p>Why do thy disciples transgredire the tradition of the ancients?</p>
<p>For they lavent manus suas, when they manducare bread.</p>
<p>And he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgredire the mandatum of God by your traditio?</p>
<p>For Deus dixit, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that maledicet patri aut matri, moriatur.</p>
<p>But ye say, Whosoever shall dixisse to his father or his mother, It is a donum, whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;</p>
<p>And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye made the mandatum of God of none effect by your traditio.</p>
<p>Hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,</p>
<p>This people draweth nigh unto me with ore, but their cor is far from me.</p>
<p>Teaching for doctrines the mandata of homines, and the traditio of the ancients.</p>
<p>And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and intelligite:</p>
<p>Not that which ingreditur in os, commaculat hominem; but that which procedit ex ore, hoc commaculat hominem.</p>
<p>Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisee, qui audierunt the word, were scandalizati?</p>
<p>But he answered and said, Every plantatum, which my caelum non planted, shall be eradicated.</p>
<p>Let them alone: they are caeci ductores of caecis. And if caecus caecum ducat, ambo in foveam cadent.</p>
<p>Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parabolam.</p>
<p>And Jesus said, Are ye also yet sine intellectu?</p>
<p>Do not ye yet intelligere, that omne, which ingreditur in os, in ventrem vadit, and is egestum in latrinam?</p>
<p>But those things which procedunt ex ore, ab corde procedunt, and eae commaculant hominem.</p>
<p>For from corde procedunt, cogitationes malae, caedes, adulteria, fornicationes, furta, falsa testimonia, blasphemiae:</p>
<p>These are the things which commaculant hominem: but to manducare with unwashed manus, non commaculat hominem.</p>
<p>Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the regiones of Tyri et Sidonis.</p>
<p>And, behold, a mulier Cananea of the same regiones came out, and cried unto him, saying, Have misericordiam on me, O Domine, filius David; my filia is grievously vexed with a daemonium.</p>
<p>But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.</p>
<p>But he answered and said, I am not missus nisi to the ovibus, qui perierunt of the domus of Israel.</p>
<p>Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Domine, adiuva me.</p>
<p>But he answered and said, It is not bonum to take the panem of the filii, and to cast it to the catelli.</p>
<p>But she said, Yea, Domine: for the catelli also eat of the micis, which fall from the mensa of their domini.</p>
<p>Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O mulier, great is thy fides: be it done unto thee as thou wilt. And her filia was sana from that hora.</p>
<p>And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the mare of Galilea, and going up into a montem, he sat down there.</p>
<p>And great multitudes came unto him, having with them clotidi, and mute, and caeci, and mancos, and many others, and cast them down at his pedes; and he healed them:</p>
<p>Insomuch that the multitudes wondered, when they saw the mute speaking, the clotidi sane, the caeci videntes, and the mancos ambulantes, and they glorificabant Deum of Israel.</p>
<p>Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have misericordiam on the multitudinem, because they continue with me now tres dies, and have nothing to manducare: and I will not dimittre them jejunos, lest they faint in the via.</p>
<p>And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have panem in the deserto to satiare so great a multitudinem?</p>
<p>And Jesus saith unto them, How many panes have ye? And they said, Septem, and a few pisciculi.</p>
<p>And he commanded the multitudinem to sit down on the terra.</p>
<p>And he took the septem panes and the pisciculi, and gratias agens, broke, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitudinem.</p>
<p>And they did all manducare, and were satiati: and they took up septem sportas full of the reliquiae.</p>
<p>And they that did manducare were quattuor milia hominum, beside mulieres and pueri.</p>
<p>And he sent away the barcam, and ascended into montem solus to orare. And when the vespera was come, he was there solus.</p>
<p>But the barca was now in the medio of the mari, tossed with the fluctus: for the ventus was contrarius.</p>
<p>And in the quarta vigilia of the noctis, Jesus venit ad eos, ambulans super mare.</p>
<p>And when the disciples saw him ambulare super mare, they were turbati, saying, It is a phantasma; and they clamabant from timore.</p>
<p>But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Habete fiduciam; ego sum, ne timueritis.</p>
<p>And Peter answered him and said, Domine, si tu es, jube me venire ad te super aquas.</p>
<p>And he said, Veni. And when Peter descended from the barca, he walked super aquas, to venire to Jesus.</p>
<p>But seeing the ventum vehementem, he was timuit: and as he began to mergi, he clamavit, saying, Domine, salva me.</p>
<p>And immediately Jesus stretched forth his manum, and took hold of him, and said unto him, O thou of little fides, why didst thou dubitare?</p>
<p>And when they were ascended into the barca, the ventus cessavit.</p>
<p>Then they that were in the barca came and worshipped him, saying, Vere tu es Filius Dei.</p>
<p>And when they were ascended into the terra, they came into the regionem of Genezareth.</p>
<p>And when the homines of that place had cognitum him, they sent into all that regionem, and brought unto him all that were languidi,</p>
<p>And besought him that they might only tetigere the orlo of his vestimentum: and as many as tetigerunt him were sana.</p>
