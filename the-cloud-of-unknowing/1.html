                    <p>Lectus, my deare brothir in Crist, I pray and beseech thee in the vertu of charite that thou be not displeased, though I, a wretch, presume to appare in thy sight with my writting.</p>
<p>Forsothe, I had rather thou shuldest be my correctour and mend me, than I shulde be thy deceptor or seducer in eny wise.</p>
<p>And therfore, I pray thee, if thou findest eny thing amis or out of order, that thou take it not in evil part, but rather amend it and correct it.</p>
<p>For I am not worthy to writte to thee, ne to eny other that is in Crist, but only of the abundance of myn harte and the plente of my spirit.</p>
<p>And forsothe, I wot well that eny thing that is writen of me to thee, is not of me, but of the vertu and wisdom of our Lorde Jesu Crist, that dwelleth in me.</p>
