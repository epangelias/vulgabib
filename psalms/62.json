  "Truly my soul waiteth upon Deus, from him cometh my salvation.",
  "He only is my rock and my salvation; he is my defence; I shall not be greatly moved.",
  "How long will ye imagine mischief against a man? ye shall be slain all of you: as a bowing wall shall ye be, and as a tottering fence.",
  "They only consult to cast him down from his excellency: they delight in lies: they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah.",
  "My soul, wait thou only upon Deus; for my expectation is from him.",
  "He only is my rock and my salvation: he is my defence; I shall not be moved.",
  "In Deus is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in Deus.",
  "Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before him: Deus is a refuge for us. Selah.",
  "Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie: to be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than vanity.",
  "Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if riches increase, set not your heart upon them.",
  " Deus hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power belongeth unto Deus.",
  "Also unto thee, O Deus, belongeth mercy: for thou renderest to every man according to his work."
