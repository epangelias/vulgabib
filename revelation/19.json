  "And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Fidelis, and Verus, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war.",
  "His eyes were as a flamme of ignis, and on his head were many diadema; and he had a written title that no man knew, but he himself.",
  "And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in sanguine, and his name is called The Word of Deus.",
  "And the armies which were in caelum followed him upon white equi, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.",
  "And out of his mouth goeth a sharp gladius, that with it he should smite the gentes: and he shall regere them with a rod of ferreum: and he treadeth the lacus of the fierceness and indignation of Deus omnipotens.",
  "And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF DOMINI.",
  "And I saw an angel standing in the sol, and he cried with a loud vox, saying to all the aves that fly in the midst of caelum, Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the magnus Deus;",
  "That ye may eat the caro of kings, and the caro of tribuni, and the caro of fortissimi, and the caro of equi, and of them that sit on them, and the caro of all men, both liberi and servi, and of small and great.",
  "And I saw the beast, and the kings of the terra, and their exercitus, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his exercitus.",
  "And the beast was taken, and with him the falsus propheta that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the character of the beast, and them that worshipped his imago.",
  "These both were cast alive into a lacus of ignis burning with sulphur.",
  "And the remnant were slain with the gladius of him that sat upon the horse, which prodeed out of his mouth: and all the volucres were filled with their caro."
