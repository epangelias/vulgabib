                    <p>At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.</p>
<p>And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise thyself, that thou be not known to be the uxor of Jeroboam; and get thee to Shiloh: behold, there is Ahijah the prophet, qui dixit me, that I should be king over this people.</p>
<p>And take with thee ten panes of bread, and cakes, and a bottle of honey, and go to him: he shall tell thee what shall become of the puer.</p>
<p>And Jeroboam's uxor did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. But Ahijah could not see; for his oculi were set by reason of his senectus.</p>
<p>And the Dominus said unto Ahijah, Behold, the uxor of Jeroboam cometh to ask a thing of thee for her filius; for he is aegrotus: thus and thus shalt thou say unto her: for it shall be, when she cometh in, that she shall feign herself to be another woman.</p>
<p>And it was so, when Ahijah heard the sonus of her pedes, as she came in at the ostium, that he said, Come in, thou uxor of Jeroboam; why feignest thou thyself to be another? for I am sent to thee with gravissimum nuntius.</p>
<p>Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith the Dominus Deus of Israel, Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the plebs, and made thee prince over my populus Israel,</p>
<p>And rent the regnum away from the domus of David, and gave it thee: and yet thou hast not been as my servus David, qui custodivit my mandata, and qui secutus est me with all his cor, to do that only which is rectum in oculis meis;</p>
<p>But hast done evil above all that were before thee: for thou wentest and madest thee other dei, and molten imagines, to provocare me to ira, and hast cast me behind thy dorsum:</p>
<p>Therefore, behold, I will bring malum upon the domus of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam him that maketh water against the parietem, him that is clausus up and a liber, and will take away the residuum of the domus of Jeroboam, as a homo taketh away dung, till it be all gone.</p>
<p>Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the civitas shall the canes eat, and him that dieth in the field shall the aves of the caelum eat: for the Dominus hath spoken it.</p>
<p>Arise thou therefore, get thee to thy domus: and when thy pedes enter into the civitas, the puer shall die.</p>
<p>And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him: for he only of Jeroboam shall come to sepultura, because in him there is found some bonum thing toward the Dominus Deus of Israel in the domus of Jeroboam.</p>
<p>Moreover the Dominus shall raise him up a rector over Israel, qui shall cut off the domus of Jeroboam that diem.</p>
<p>For the Dominus shall smite Israel, as a canna is moved before the aqua, and shall eradicate Israel out of this terra bona, which he gave to their patres, and shall scatter them beyond the flumen, because they have made their luci, provoking the Dominus to ira:</p>
<p>And he shall give Israel up because of the peccata of Jeroboam, who did peccare, and who made Israel to peccare.</p>
<p>And Jeroboam's uxor arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah: and when she came to the limen of the domus, the puer died;</p>
<p>And they buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, according to the verbum of the Dominus, which he spake by the manu of his servus Ahijah the prophet.</p>
<p>And the rest of the acta of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he regnavit, behold, they are written in the libro of the annales of the reges of Israel.</p>
<p>And the dies which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty anni, and he slept with his patres, and Nadab his filius regnavit in his locum.</p>
<p>And Rehoboam the filius of Solomon regnavit in Judah. Rehoboam was one and forty anni old when he began to regnare, and he regnavit seventeen anni in Jerusalem, the civitas which the Dominus had chosen out of all the tribus of Israel, to put his nomine there. And his mater's nomine was Naamah an Ammonitissa.</p>
<p>And Judah did malum in the oculis of the Dominus, and they provocaverunt him to ira above all that their patres had done, in their peccatis which they had peccatum.</p>
<p>For they also built them altaria, and statuas, and luci upon every high collis, and under every frondosus arbor.</p>
<p>And there were also sodomites in the terra: they did according to all the abominationes of the gentes which the Dominus cast out before the filii of Israel.</p>
<p>And it came to passe in the fifth annus of king Rehoboam, that Shishak rex of Aegyptus came up against Jerusalem:</p>
<p>With twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand equites: and the populus were without numerus that came with him out of Aegyptus; the Libyans, the Sukkiims, and the Aethiopes.</p>
<p>And he took the muniti urbes of Judah, and came to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Now the prophet Shemaiah came to Rehoboam, and to the principes of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said unto them, Thus saith the Dominus, Ye have forsaken me, and therefore have I also left you in the manu of Shishak.</p>
<p>Whereupon the principes of Israel and the rex humbled themselves; and they said, The Dominus is just.</p>
<p>And when the Dominus saw that they humbled themselves, the verbum of the Dominus came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves; therefore I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some salus; and my furor shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the manu of Shishak.</p>
<p>Nevertheless they shall be servi to him; that they may know my servitium, and the servitium of the regna of the gentes.</p>
<p>So Shishak rex of Aegyptus came up against Jerusalem, and took away the thesauri of the domus of the Dominus, and the thesauri of the rex's domus; he took all: he carried away also the scuta of aurum which Solomon had made.</p>
<p>And king Rehoboam made in their locum scuta of aes, and committed them unto the manu of the principes of the satellites, who kept the ostium of the rex's domus.</p>
<p>And it was so, when the rex went into the domus of the Dominus, that the satellites bare them, and brought them back to the armaturarum domus.</p>
<p>And when he humbled himself, the ira of the Dominus turned from him, that he would not destroy him altogether: and also in Judah there were bona res.</p>
<p>So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and regnavit: for Rehoboam was one and forty anni old when he began to regnare, and he regnavit seventeen anni in Jerusalem, the civitas which the Dominus had chosen out of all the tribus of Israel, to put his nomine there.</p>
<p>And the name of his mater was Naamah an Ammonitissa. And he did malum, because he prepared not his cor to cercare the Dominus.</p>
<p>Now the acta of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the libro of Shemaiah the prophet, and in the libro of Iddo the seer concerning genealogias? And there were belli between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their dies.</p>
<p>And Rehoboam slept with his patres, and was buried with his patres in the civitas of David: and his mater's name was Naamah an Ammonitissa. And Abijah his filius regnavit in his locum.</p>
