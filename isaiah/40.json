  "Every vallis shall be exalted, and every mons and hill shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made direct, and the aspera places plain:",
  "And the gloria of the Dominus shall be revealed, and all caro shall see it together: for the os of the Dominus hath spoken it.",
  "The vox said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All caro is gramineus, and all the gratia thereof is as the flos of the field:",
  "The gramineus withereth, the flos fadeth: because the spiritus of the Dominus bloweth upon it: surely the populus is gramineus.",
  "The vox said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All caro is gramineus, and all the gratia thereof is as the flos of the field:",
  "The vox of the Dominus saying, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All caro is gramineus, and all the gratia thereof is as the flos of the field:",
  "O Zion, that bringest good tidings, get thee up into the high mons; O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings, lift up thy vox with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the civitates of Judah, Behold your Deus!",
  "Behold, the Dominus Deus will come with strong manus, and his arm shall rule for him: behold, his merces is with him, and his work before him.",
  "He shall feed his gregem like a pastor: he shall gather the agnellus with his arm, and carry them in his sinus, and shall gently lead those that are with young.",
  "Who hath measured the aquis with the palm of his manus, and meted out the coelum with the span, and comprehended the pulvis of the earth in a measure, and weighed the montes in scales, and the colles in a balance?",
  "Who hath directed the Spiritus of the Dominus, or being his consiliarius hath taught him?",
  "With whom took he counsel, and who instructed him, and taught him in the via of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and shewed to him the way of understanding?",
  "Behold, the Gentiles are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the pulvis of the balance: behold, he taketh up the insulae as a very little thing.",
  "And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt offering.",
  "All Gentiles before him are as nothing; and they are counted to him less than nothing, and vanity.",
  "To whom then will ye liken Deus? or what similitude will ye compare unto him?",
  "The workman melteth a graven image, and the goldsmith spreadeth it over with gold, and casteth silver chains.",
  "He that is so impoverished that he hath no oblation chooseth a tree that will not rot; he seeketh unto him a cunning workman to prepare a graven image, that shall not be moved.",
  "Have ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it not been told you from the beginning? have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth?",
  "It is he that sitteth upon the orbis of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as locustae; that stretcheth out the coelum as a vellum, and spreadeth them out as a tabernaculum to dwell in:",
  "That bringeth the princes to nothing; he maketh the judges of the earth as vanity.",
  "Yea, they shall not be planted; yea, they shall not be sown: yea, their stock shall not take root in the earth: and he shall also blow upon them, and they shall wither, and the tempest shall take them away as stubble.",
  "To whom then will ye liken me, or shall I be equal? saith the Sanctus.",
  "Lift up your oculus on high, and behold who hath created these things, that bringeth out their host by number: he calleth them all by names by the magnitudo of his potentia, for that he is strong in virtus; not one faileth.",
  "Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, My way is hid from the Dominus, and my judgment is passed over from my Deus?",
  "Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that the Deus sempiternus, the Dominus, the Creator of the fines of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? there is no searching of his understanding.",
  "He giveth potentia to the faint; and to them that have no virtus he increaseth strength.",
  "Even the juvenis shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall:",
  "But they that wait upon the Dominus shall renew their fortitudo; they shall ascend by wing, as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint."
