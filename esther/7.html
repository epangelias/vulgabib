                    <p>So the king and Haman came to banquet with Queen Esther.</p>
<p>And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition, Queen Esther? it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? it shall be performed, even to the half of the regnum.</p>
<p>Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found gratiam in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my vita be given me at my petitio, and my populus at my request:</p>
<p>For we are sold, I and my populus, to be destroyed, to be killed, and to be annihilated. Now if we had been sold for servi, I had held my tongue, although the enemy could not counterbalance the king's damnum.</p>
<p>Then the king Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther the queen, Who is this, and where is he, that durst presume in his cor to do so?</p>
<p>And Esther said, The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman. Then Haman was terrified before the king and the queen.</p>
<p>And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his furore went into the hortus of the palace: and Haman stood up to make request for his vita to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was determined contra him malum by the king.</p>
<p>Then the king returned out of the hortus of the palace into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the pulvinar whereon Esther was. Then said the king, Will he even force the regina before me in the domus? As the word went out of the king's os, they covered Haman's facies.</p>
<p>And Harbonah, one of the eunuchi, said before the king, Behold also, the lignum which he had prepared for Mordecai, who had spoken bene of the king, standeth in the domus of Haman, the height of which is fifty cubits.</p>
<p>Then the king said, Hang him thereon. So they hanged Haman on the lignum which he had prepared for Mordecai. Then was the king's furore pacified.</p>
