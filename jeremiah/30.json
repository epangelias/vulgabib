  "14 All thy amici have forgotten thee; they do not quaerere thy salutem: for I have wounded thee with the plagis of inimicus, with the castigatio of crudelis, for the multitudo of thy iniquitates, because thy peccata are increased.",
  "15 Why criest thou for dolore? thy dolor is incurabilis for the multitudo of thy iniquitates: thy peccata are increased, therefore I have done these things unto thee.",
  "16 Therefore all they that devorant thee shall be devorati; and all thine adversaries, every unus of them, shall go into captivitatem; and they that spoliabunt thee shall be spoliati, and all they that praedabuntur te will I give for praedam.",
