                    <p>1 And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:</p>
<p>2 And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.</p>
<p>3 And when they wanted vinum, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no vinum: ita Jesus saith unto her, Mulier, quid mihi et tibi est? That is, What have I to do with thee, mulier? mine hora is not yet come.</p>
<p>4 His mother saith unto the ministri, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.</p>
<p>5 And there were set there six lapides waterpots of petra, after the manner of the purificatio of the Iudaei, containing two or three metretas apiece.</p>
<p>6 Jesus saith unto them, Implete the waterpots with aqua. And they filled them up to the summit.</p>
<p>7 And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and beare unto the architriclinius. And they bare it.</p>
<p>8 When the architriclinius had tasted the aqua vinum, and knew not whence it was: (but the ministri which drew the aqua knew;) the architriclinius called the sponsus,</p>
<p>9 And saith unto him, Every man at first presenateth the bonum vinum; and when men have well drunk, then that which is secundum: but thou hast kept the bonum vinum until now.</p>
<p>10 This beginning of signa did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his gloria; and his disciples believed on him.</p>
<p>11 After this he went down to Capharnaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many dies.</p>
<p>12 After this he went down to Ierusalem at the diem festus of the Iudaei: and Jesus also went up to Ierusalem.</p>
<p>13 And found in the templum those that sold boves, and oves, and columbae, and the nummularii sitting:</p>
<p>14 And when he had made a flagellum of funiculi, he drove them all out of the templum, and the oves, and the boves; and poured out the argentum of the nummularii, and overthrew the tables;</p>
<p>15 And said unto them that sold columbae, Take these things hence; make not the domus of my Pater a domus emptionis.</p>
<p>16 And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zelus of thy domus hath eaten me up.</p>
<p>17 Then answered the Iudaei and said unto him, What signum shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?</p>
<p>18 Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this templum, and in tres dies I will raise it up.</p>
<p>19 Then said the Iudaei, Forty and six annus was this templum in building, and wilt thou rear it up in tres dies?</p>
<p>20 But he spake of the templum of his corpus.</p>
<p>21 But when he was raised from the mortui, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.</p>
<p>22 When therefore he was in Ierusalem at the diem festus, many believed in his nomine, when they saw the signa which he did.</p>
<p>23 But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men,</p>
<p>24 And needed not that any should testificari of man: for he knew what was in man.</p>
<p>25 And there was a man of the Pharisaiei, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Iudaei:</p>
