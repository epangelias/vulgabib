  "On that night could not the king sleep, and he commanded to bring the Libri of the Records of the Chronica, and they were read before the king.",
  "And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's chamberlains, the keepers of the porta, who sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.",
  "And the king said, What honour and dignitas hath been done to Mordecai for this? Then said the king's servi, who ministered unto him, There is nothing done for him.",
  "And the king said, Who is in the atrium? Now Haman was come into the atrium without, unto the king's aula, to speak unto the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.",
  "And the king's servi said unto him, Behold, Haman standeth in the atrium. And the king said, Let him come in.",
  "So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour? Now Haman thought in his cor, To whom would the king delight to do honour more than to myself?",
  "And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king delighteth to honour, Let the royal vestis be brought which the king useth to wear, and the equus on which the king rideth, and the corona royal which is set upon his capite.",
  "And let this vestis and equus be delivered to the hand of one of the king's most noble principes, that they may array the man withal whom the king delighteth to honour, and bring him on equus through the platea of the urbs, and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honour.",
  "Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the vestis and the equus, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that sitteth at the porta of the king.",
  "And let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken. Then took Haman the vestis and the equus, and arrayed Mordecai, and brought him on equus through the platea of the urbs, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour.",
  "And Mordecai came again to the porta of the king; but Haman hasted to his domus, mourning and having his capite covered.",
  "And Haman told Zeresh his uxor and all his amici every thing that had befallen him. Then said his sapientes and Zeresh his uxor unto him, If Mordecai be of the semen of the Judaei, before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou shalt not prevail against him, but shalt surely fall before him.",
  "And while they were yet talking with him, came the king's eunuchi, and hasted to bring Haman unto the banquet that Esther had prepared."
