                    <p>Unto thee, O Deus, do I lift up my animus: my Deus, I have trusted in thee, let me not be confused, neither let mine inimici triumph over me.</p>
<p>Yea, let none that wait on thee be ashamed: let them be ashamed which transgress without causa.</p>
<p>Shew me thy vias, O Deus; teach me thy semitas.</p>
<p>Lead me forth in thy veritas, and doce me: for thou art Deus my Salvator; on thee do I wait all the die.</p>
<p>Remember, O Deus, thy misericordiam and thy amor: for they have been from sempiternum.</p>
<p>Remember not the peccata of my iuventus and my delicta: according to thy misericordiam remember thou me for thy bonitas' sake, O Deus.</p>
<p>Gratiosus and iustus is Deus: propterea he will doce peccatores in the via.</p>
<p>He will guide the mansuetos in iudicium: and he will doce the mansuetos in his via.</p>
<p>All the vias of Deus are misericordiam and veritas to such as keep his pactum and testimonium.</p>
<p>Quia thy nomine's sake, O Deus, I pray thee, be propitius unto my peccatum: for it is multum.</p>
<p>Quis est homo that feareth Deus, him shall he teach in the via that he shall choose.</p>
<p>His animus shall rest in bonitas: and his semen shall inherit terram.</p>
<p>The secretum of Deus is with them that feareth him; and he will shew them his pactum.</p>
<p>Mine oculi are ever toward Deus: for he shall pluck my pedes out of laqueus.</p>
<p>Respice in me, and misere me: for I am solus and pauper.</p>
<p>The angustiae of my cor have increased: deliver me out of my angustiae.</p>
<p>Look upon mine afflictio and my labor: and forgive all my peccata.</p>
<p>Consider mine inimici: for they are multus; and they have hated me with odium implacabile.</p>
<p>Keep my animus and my corpus: for I have trusted in thee.</p>
<p>Let integrity and equitas preserve me: for I wait on thee.</p>
<p>Redime Israel, O Deus, out of all his afflictiones.</p>
