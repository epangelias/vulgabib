                    <p>And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a beautiful soror, whose nomen was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.</p>
<p>And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his soror Tamar; for she was a virgo, and Amnon thought it difficile for him to do any thing to her.</p>
<p>But Amnon had a friend, whose nomen was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's frater: and Jonadab was a very prudent homo.</p>
<p>And he said unto him, Why art thou, being the filius of the rex, so macer every dies? Wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto him, I love Tamar, my soror.</p>
<p>And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy lectus, and make thyself sick: and when thy pater cometh to visit thee, say unto him, I pray thee, let my soror Tamar come, and give me cibus, and let her prepare the cibus in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it at her manus.</p>
<p>So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the rex was come to visit him, Amnon said unto the rex, I pray thee, let Tamar my soror come, and make me a couple of panis, that I may eat at her manus.</p>
<p>Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy frater Amnon's domus, and make him some cibus.</p>
<p>So Tamar went to her frater Amnon's domus; and he was acumbens. And she took farinam, and kneaded it, and made panis in his sight, and did bake the panis.</p>
<p>And she took a patina, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all homines from me. And they went out every homo from him.</p>
<p>And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the cibus into the cubiculum, that I may eat of thine manus. And Tamar took the panis which she had made, and brought them into the cubiculum to Amnon her frater.</p>
<p>And when she had brought them unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my soror.</p>
<p>And she answered him, Nay, my frater, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not this folly.</p>
<p>And I, whither shall I cause my ignominia to go? and as for thee, thou shalt be as one of the imprudentes in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the rex; for he will not withhold me from thee.</p>
<p>Howbeit he would not hearken unto her vox: but, being stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her.</p>
<p>Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the amor wherewith he had loved her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.</p>
<p>And she said unto him, There is no causa: this evil in sending me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me. But he would not hearken unto her.</p>
<p>Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said, Put now this homo out from me, and bolt the ostium after her.</p>
<p>And she had a vestis of divers colours upon her: for with such vestes were the filiae of the rex that were virgins apparelled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the ostium after her.</p>
<p>And Tamar put ashes on her caput, and rent her vestis of divers colours that was on her, and laid her manus on her caput, and went on crying.</p>
<p>And Absalom her frater said unto her, Hath Amnon thy frater been with thee? but hold now thy peace, my soror: he is thy frater; regard not this thing. So Tamar remained, and was desolata in her frater Absalom's domus.</p>
<p>But when rex David heard of all these things, he was very angry.</p>
<p>And Absalom spake unto his frater Amnon neither good nor evil: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his soror Tamar.</p>
<p>And it came to pass after two anni, that Absalom had shearers in Baalhazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the filii of the rex.</p>
<p>And Absalom came to the rex, and said, Behold now, thy servant hath shearers; let the rex, I beseech thee, and his servants go with thy servant.</p>
<p>And the rex said to Absalom, Nay, my filius, let us not now all go, lest we be chargeable unto thee. And he pressed him: howbeit he would not go, but blessed him.</p>
<p>Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my frater Amnon go with us. And the rex said unto him, Why should he go with thee?</p>
<p>But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the filii of the rex go with him.</p>
<p>Now the rex's words were as follows, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Baalhazor, and Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the bucina, then ye shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.</p>
<p>And with Absalom went two hundred homines out of Jerusalem, that were invited, and went in their simplicitas, and they knew not any thing.</p>
<p>And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's consiliarius, from his civitas, even from Giloh, while he offered sacrificia. And the coniuratio was strong; for the populus increased continually with Absalom.</p>
<p>And there came a nuntius to David, saying, The cor of Israel is gone after Absalom.</p>
<p>And David said unto all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not else escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the civitas with the edge of the gladius.</p>
<p>And the rex's servants said unto the rex, Behold, thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the rex shall appoint.</p>
<p>And the rex went forth, and all his domus after him. And the rex left ten concubinae to keep the domus.</p>
<p>And the rex went forth, and all the populus after him, and tarried in a place that was far off.</p>
<p>And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred homines which came after him from Gath, passed on before the rex.</p>
<p>Then said the rex to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with us? return to thy locus, and abide with the rex: for thou art a stranger, and also an exile.</p>
<p>Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this dai cause thee to go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return thou, and take back thy fratres: mercifulness and veritas be with thee.</p>
<p>And Ittai answered the rex, and said, As the Lord liveth, and as my lord the rex liveth, surely in what place my lord the rex shall be, whether in morte or life, even there also will thy servant be.</p>
<p>And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his homines, and all the pueri that were with him.</p>
<p>And all the terra wept with a loud vox, and all the populus passed over: the rex also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the populus passed over, toward the via of the oliveta.</p>
<p>And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing the arca of the covenant of God: and they set down the arca of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the populus had done passing out of the civitas.</p>
<p>And the rex said unto Zadok, Carry back the arca of God into the civitas: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the Lord, he will bring me again, and shew me both it, and his habitaculum:</p>
<p>But if he thus say, I have no delectation in thee; behold, here am I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him.</p>
<p>The rex said also unto Zadok the sacerdos, Art not thou a seer? return into the civitas in peace, and your two filii with you, Ahimaaz thy filius, and Jonathan the filius of Abiathar.</p>
<p>See, I will tarry in the plains of the deserta, until there come word from you to certify me.</p>
<p>Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the arca of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there.</p>
<p>And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his caput covered, and he went barefoot: and all the populus that was with him covered every homo his caput, and they went up, weeping as they went up.</p>
<p>And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the coniurati with Absalom. And David said, O Lord, I pray thee, turn the consilium of Ahithophel into fatuitas.</p>
<p>And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top of the mount, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his vestis rent, and earth upon his caput:</p>
<p>Unto whom David said, If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a burden unto me:</p>
<p>But if thou return to the civitas, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy servant, O rex; as I have been thy pater's servant hitherto, so will I now also be thy servant: then mayest thou for me defeat the consilium of Ahithophel.</p>
<p>And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the sacerdotes? therefore it shall be, that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the rex's domus, thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the sacerdotes.</p>
<p>Behold, they have there with them their two filii, Ahimaaz Zadok's filius, and Jonathan Abiathar's filius; and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye can hear.</p>
<p>So Hushai David's friend came into the civitas, and Absalom came into Jerusalem.</p>
