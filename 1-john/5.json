  "Everyone communitas that hath this world doth confess that Jesus Christ is come in caro, and this is he that came by aqua and sanguine.",
  "He that believeth that Jesus is the Christ is genitus of God: and every one that loveth Him that genitus also loveth Him qui genitus of Him.",
  "By this we know that we love the filii of God, when we love God and keep His mandata.",
  "For this is the caritas of God, that we keep His mandata: and His mandata are not grauia.",
  "For whatsoever is genitus of God overcometh mundum: and this is the victoria that overcometh mundum, even our fides.",
  "Who is he that overcometh mundum, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Filius of God?",
  "This is He that came by aqua and sanguine, even Jesus Christ; not by aqua only, but by aqua and sanguine: and it is the Spirit that beareth testimonium, because the Spirit is veritas.",
  "For there are three that bear record in caelo, the Father, the Verbum, and the Holy Spirit: and these three are unum.",
  "And there are three that bear witness in terra, the Spirit, and the aqua, and the sanguine: and these three agree in unum.",
  "If we receive the testimonium of homines, the testimonium of God is greater: for this is the testimonium of God which He hath testified of His Filius.",
  "He that believeth on the Filius of God hath the testimonium in himself: he that believeth not God hath made Him mendacem; because he believeth not the record that God gave of His Filius.",
  "And this is the record, that God hath given to us aeternam vitam, and this vita is in His Filius.",
  "He that hath the Filius hath vitam; and he that hath not the Filius of God hath not vitam.",
  "These things have I written unto you that believe on the nomine of the Filius of God; that ye may know that ye have aeternam vitam, and that ye may believe on the nomine of the Filius of God.",
  "And this is the fiducia that we have in Him, that, if we petimus any thing according to His voluntas, He heareth us:",
  "And if we know that He hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitiones that we desired of Him.",
  "If any man see his brother peccare a peccato that is not unto mortem, he shall ask, and He shall give him vita for them that sin not unto mortem. There is a sin unto mortem: I do not say that he shall pray for it.",
  "All unrighteousness is peccatum: and there is a peccatum not unto mortem.",
  "We know that whosoever is genitus of God sinneth not; but he that was genitus of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not.",
  "We know that we are of God, and the whole mundum lieth in wickedness.",
  "And we know that the Filius of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know Him that is verus.",
  "And we are in Him that is verus, even in His Filius Jesus Christ. This is the verus God, and aeterna vita.",
  "Little children, keep yourselves from idola. Amen."
