                    <p>It is I, the Father, who am the one who is, the invisible one, whom no one has seen.</p>
<p>I am the one who is, the Father, and I am the one who is with the Son, and I am the one who is with the Holy Spirit, for we are three eternal aeons, and we are one in the Spirit, and we are one in the unity, and we are one in the power.</p>
<p>And I am the one who is, the Father, and I have emitted the Word, and the Word is the Son, and the Son is the one who is, the anointed one, the Christ, and the anointed one is the one who is, the king, and the king is the one who is, the eternal one.</p>
<p>And I am the one who is, the Father, and I have emitted the one who is, the aeon, and the aeon is the one who is, the holy one, and the holy one is the one who is, the eternal one.</p>
<p>And I have emitted the one who is, the aeon, and the aeon is the one who is, the Mother, and the Mother is the one who is, the holy one, and the holy one is the one who is, the eternal one.</p>
<p>And I have emitted the one who is, the aeon, and the aeon is the one who is, the Pleroma, and the Pleroma is the one who is, the eternal one, and the eternal one is the one who is, the Father, and the Father is the one who is, the one who is, the one who is, the one who is, the Father.</p>
<p>And the aeon is the one who is, the one who is, the one who is, and the one who is, is the one who is, the Father, and the Father is the one who is, the one who is, the one who is, the one who is, the aeon.</p>
<p>And the Pleroma is the one who is, the one who is, the one who is, and the one who is, is the one who is, the aeon, and the aeon is the one who is, the one who is, the one who is, the one who is, the Pleroma.</p>
