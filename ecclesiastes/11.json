  "Cast thy panem upon the aquae: for thou shalt find it after many dies.",
  "Give a portion to septem, and also to octo; for thou knowest not what malum shall be upon the terra.",
  "If the sol be risen upon thee, and the pluvia be upon the herba, yet thou shalt not know what dies shall be.",
  "Or ever the argent cord be loosed, or the aureus bowl be broken, or the hydria be broken at the fons, or the rota be broken at the cisterna.",
  "Then shall the pulvis return to the terra, as it was: and the spiritus shall return unto Deus who gave it.",
  "Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher; all is vanity.",
  "And moreover, because the sapientia is a defensor of life to him that hath it, and the scientia of the prudentia preserveth the life of him that hath it.",
  "For it is better that thou shouldest not vovere, than that thou shouldest vovere and not facere it.",
  "Be not hasty in lingua, and let not thy cor ferat thee to vovere any thing to Deus: for Deus is in caelo, and thou art upon terra: therefore let thy sermones be pauci.",
  "For a somnium cometh through the multitudinem of occupationes, and the vox of a fatuus shall be known by a multitudinem of verba.",
  "My filius, beware of vowing and making promises, and meddle not with Deus, for it is an error of the ignorantia of man to vowe and not to facere it.",
  "If thou shalt vovere unto Deus, fac it, and deferre not: for there is no placere in the fata of the stultorum."
