                    <p>1 The word of the Dominus that came to Micah the Morasthite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.</p>
<p>2 Hear, O peoples, all of you; hearken, O earth, and all that therein is: and let the Dominus Deus be witness against you, the Dominus from his holy templum.</p>
<p>3 For, behold, the Dominus cometh forth out of his locus, and will come down, and tread upon the high places of the terra.</p>
<p>4 And the montes shall be molten under him, and the valles shall be cleft, as wax before the facem ignis, and as the aquae that are poured down a declivem.</p>
<p>5 For the scelus of Jacob is all this, and for the peccata of the domus of Israel. What is the scelus of Jacob? is it not Samaria? and what are the excelsa of Judah? are they not Jerusalem?</p>
<p>6 Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the ager, and as plantations of a vineyard: and I will pour down the lapides thereof into the vallis, and I will discover the fundamenta thereof.</p>
<p>7 And all the sculptilia thereof shall be beaten to pieces, and all the merces thereof shall be burnt with ignis, and all the idola thereof will I destroy: for she gathered it of the merces of a meretrix, and they shall return to the merces of a meretrix.</p>
<p>8 Therefore I will lament and howl, I will go stripped and naked: I will make a lamentation like the dracones, and a mourning like the ostriches.</p>
<p>9 For her plaga is incurable; for it is come unto Judah; he is come unto the porta of my populus, even to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>10 Declare ye it not at Acco, lest the Philistines rejoice, lest the filii of the Palestini take courage.</p>
