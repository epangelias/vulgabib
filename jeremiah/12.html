                    <p>1. Righteous art thou, O Deus, when I plead with thee: yet let me talk with thee of iudicia. Why doth the via of the wicked prosper? wherefore are all they happy that deal very treacherously?</p>
<p>2. Thou hast planted them, yea, they have taken radix: they grow, yea, they bring forth fructus: thou art near in their mouth, and far from their reins.</p>
<p>3. But thou, O Deus, knowest me: thou hast seen me, and tried mine cor: pull them out like oves for the slaughter.</p>
<p>4. How long shall the terra mourn, and the herba of every field wither, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein? the anima and the avis are consumed: because they said, He shall not see our finis.</p>
<p>5. If thou hast run with pedes, and they have wearied thee, then how canst thou contend with equi? and if in the terra of pacis, wherein thou trustedst, they wearied thee, then how wilt thou do in the swelling of Iordan?</p>
<p>6. For even thy fratres, and the domus of thy pater, even they have dealt treacherously with thee; yea, they have called a multitude after thee: believe them not, though they speak bona to thee.</p>
<p>7. I have forsaken mine domus, I have left mine hereditas: I have given the dilecta of my animus into the manus of her enemies.</p>
<p>8. Mine hereditas is unto me as a leo in the forest; it crieth out against me: therefore have I hated it.</p>
<p>9. Shall I be as a variegated avis, and a avis circumcingens about? Go ye, gather all the bestiae of the field, bring to devour.</p>
<p>10. Many pastores have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolata wilderness.</p>
<p>11. They have made it desolata, and being desolata it mourneth unto me; the whole terra is made desolata, because no homo layeth it to cor.</p>
<p>12. The spoilers are come upon all high places through the desert: for the gladius of the Domini shall devour from the one end of the terra even to the other end of the terra: no caro shall have pacis.</p>
<p>13. They have sown triticum, but shall reap spinas: they have put themselves to labour, but shall not profit: and they shall be ashamed of your fructus, because of the fervent indignatio of the Domini.</p>
