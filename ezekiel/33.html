                    <p>Again the word of the Dominus came unto me, saying,</p>
<p>Son of man, speak to the children of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Dominus Deus; Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the Gentes, whither they be gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own terra.</p>
<p>And I will make them one gens in the terra upon the montes of Israel; and one rex shall be rex to them all: and they shall be no more two gentes, neither shall they be divided into two regna any more at all:</p>
<p>Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idolis, nor with their abominations, nor with any of their transgressions: but I will save them out of all their dwelling places, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my populus, and I will be their Deus.</p>
<p>And David my servus shall be rex over them; and they all shall have one pastor: they shall also walk in my judicia, and observe my statuta, and do them.</p>
<p>And they shall dwell in the terra that I have given unto Jacob my servus, wherein your fathers have dwelt; and they shall dwell therein, even they, and their children, and their children's children for ever: and my servus David shall be their prince for ever.</p>
<p>Moreover I will make a foedus of pacem with them; it shall be an everlasting foedus with them: and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuarium in the midst of them for evermore.</p>
<p>My tabernaculum also shall be with them: yea, I will be their Deus, and they shall be my populus.</p>
<p>And the Gentes shall know that I the Dominus do sanctify Israel, when my sanctuarium shall be in the midst of them for evermore.</p>
<p>And thou, son of man, thus saith the Dominus Deus; Say unto the filii of Israel; Thus ye speak, saying, Our rebelliones and our peccata are upon us, and we pine away in them: how should we then live?</p>
<p>Say unto them, As I live, saith the Dominus Deus, I have no pleasure in the morte of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his via, and live: turn ye, turn ye from your malae vias; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?</p>
<p>Therefore, thou son of man, say unto the children of Israel; Thus saith the Dominus Deus; Repent, and turn yourselves from your idolis; and turn away your faces from all your abominations.</p>
<p>For I have no pleasure in the morte of him that dieth, saith the Dominus Deus; wherefore turn yourselves, and live ye.</p>
<p>Again, when a justus man doth turn from his justitia, and commit iniquitas, I will lay a stumblingblock before him, and he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his peccatum, and his justitia which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his sanguis will I require at thine hand.</p>
<p>Nevertheless if thou warn the justus man, that the justus sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy anima.</p>
<p>Moreover if the wicked turn from his wickedness, and do that which is legal and just, he shall live thereby.</p>
<p>Because he considereth, and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die.</p>
<p>Yet the children of Israel say, The via of the Dominus is not equal. O house of Israel, I will judge you every one after his vias.</p>
<p>Again, when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed, and doth that which is legal and just, he shall save his anima.</p>
<p>Because he considereth, and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die.</p>
<p>If the wicked restore the pledge, give again that he had robbed, walk in the statuta of life, without committing iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die.</p>
<p>None of his transgressions that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto him: he hath done that which is just and justum; he shall surely live.</p>
<p>Yet the children of Israel say, The via of the Dominus is not just. O house of Israel, I will judge you every one after his vias.</p>
<p>Also, thou son of man, thus saith the Dominus Deus; In the day of the sanctification of the terra, there shall be no rain in the terra, nor any thing that bringeth forth the fructus of the terra.</p>
<p>And it shall be, when any one heareth the clangor of the bucina, and taketh not warning; if the gladius come, and take him away, his sanguis shall be upon his own caput.</p>
<p>He heard the clangor of the bucina, and took not warning; his sanguis shall be upon him. But he that taketh warning shall deliver his anima.</p>
<p>But if the watchman see the gladius come, and blow not the bucina, and the populus be not warned; if the gladius come, and take any persona from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his sanguis will I require at the watchman's hand.</p>
<p>So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my os, and warn them from me.</p>
<p>When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his via, he shall die in his iniquity; but his sanguis will I require at thine hand.</p>
<p>Again, When I say unto the justus, Thou shalt surely live; if he trust to his own justitia, and commit iniquity, all his justitiae shall not be remembered; but for his iniquity that he hath committed, he shall die for it.</p>
<p>Therefore, O thou son of man, say unto the house of Israel; Thus ye speak, saying, Our transgressions and our peccata are upon us, and we pine away in them: how should we then live?</p>
<p>Say unto them, As I live, saith the Dominus Deus, I have no pleasure in the morte of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his via, and live: turn ye, turn ye from your malae vias; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?</p>
