  "Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was gathered together as uno animus, as one man, from Dan even to Beersheba, with the terra of Gilead, unto the Lord in Mizpeh.",
  "And the chief of all the people, even of all the tribus of Israel, presented themselves in the congregation of the populus of God, four hundred thousand pedes that drew sword.",
  "Now the children of Benjamin heard that the filii of Israel were gone up to Mizpeh. Then said the filii of Israel, Tell us, how was this scelus committed?",
  "And the Levite, the vir of the mulier that was murdered, answered and said, I came into Gibeah that pertaineth to Benjamin, I and my concubina, to lodge.",
  "And the domini of Gibeah rose up against me, and beset the domus round about upon me by nocte, and thought to have occisus me: and my concubina have they humilis to death.",
  "And I took my concubina, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the terra of the hereditas of Israel: for they have committed scelus and stuprum in Israel.",
  "Behold, ye are all the filii of Israel; give your consilium and sententia here.",
  "And all the populus arose as uno vir, saying, We will not any of us go to his tabernaculum, neither will we any of us turn into his domus:",
  "But now this shall be the verbum which we will do to Gibeah; we will go up by sorte against it;",
  "And we will take ten vires of the hundred throughout all the tribus of Israel, and an hundred of the thousand, and a thousand of the ten thousand, to bring victualia for the populus, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the malum that they have wrought in Israel.",
  "So all the viri of Israel were gathered against the civitas, knit together as uno animus.",
  "And the tribus of Israel sent viri through all the tribus of Israel, saying, Who is he that came not up to Mizpeh to the Lord? And, behold, none came to the castra from Jabeshgilead to the congregation.",
  "For the populus were numbered of the civitas of Jabeshgilead, and they found none there.",
  "And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand vires of the valentiores of Israel, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead with the gladius, with the mulieres and the liberi.",
  "And this is the verbum which ye shall do, Ye shall utterly destruere every mas and every mulier that hath known coitum with a vir.",
  "And they found among the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead four hundred mulieres, that were virgines, which had known no viro by coitum; and they brought them unto the castra to Shiloh, which is in the terra of Canaan.",
  "And the whole congregation sent some to speak to the filii of Benjamin that were in the petra Rimmon, and to call them in pace.",
  "And Benjamin came again at that tempus; and they gave them the mulieres which they had saved alive of the mulieres of Jabeshgilead: and yet so they sufficed them not.",
  "And the populus did penance for Benjamin, because that the Lord had made a caesura in the tribus of Israel."
