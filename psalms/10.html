                    <p>1 Why standest thou afar off, O Deus, and hidest thyself in tempus of tribulation?</p>
<p>2 The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor: let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined.</p>
<p>3 For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desiderium, and blesseth the covetous, whom the Dominus abhorreth.</p>
<p>4 The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after Deus: Deus is not in all his cogitationes.</p>
<p>5 His viai are always grievous; thy judicia are far above out of his sight: as for all his enemies, he puffeth at them.</p>
<p>6 He hath said in his cor, I shall not be moved: for I shall never be in adversitas.</p>
<p>7 His os is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his lingua is miseria and iniquitas.</p>
<p>8 He sitteth in insidiis with the princes of his populus, to lay wait in secret places for the innocent: his oculi are privily set against the poor.</p>
<p>9 He lieth in wait secretly as a leo in his spelunca; he lieth in wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net.</p>
<p>10 He croucheth, and humbleth himself, that the miseros may fall by his potentia.</p>
<p>11 He hath said in his cor, Deus hath forgotten: he hideth his facies; he will never see it.</p>
<p>12 Arise, O Dominus; O Deus, lift up thine manus: forget not the humiles.</p>
<p>13 Wherefore doth the wicked contemn Deus? he hath said in his cor, Thou wilt not require it.</p>
<p>14 Thou hast seen it; for thou beholdest miseria and sorrow, to requite it with thy manus: the poor committeth himself unto thee; thou art the adiutor of the orphan.</p>
<p>15 Break thou the brachium of the wicked and the malignant: seek out his iniquitas, till thou find none.</p>
<p>16 Deus reignedth for ever and ever: the gentes are perished out of his terra.</p>
<p>17 Deus, thou hast heard the desiderium of the humiles: thou wilt prepare their cor, thou wilt cause thine aurem to hear:</p>
<p>18 To judge the orphan and the oppressus, that the homo of the terra may no more terrify.</p>
