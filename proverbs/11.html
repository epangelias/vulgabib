                    <p>The facultas of the just bringeth a citadel: but the cupiditas of the wicked shall destroy them.</p>
<p>When the malus perish, there is shouting: but the just are in magnificatio.</p>
<p>In the lips of him that hath intellectus wisdom is found: but a rod is for the back of him that is destitute of intellectus.</p>
<p>The just is delivered out of angustia, and the malus cometh in his stead.</p>
<p>The just shall flourish as a palma tree: he shall grow like a cedrus in Libanus.</p>
<p>He that hath auctus his auctoritas in the fear of the Dominus shall be blessed.</p>
<p>The way of the Domini is fortitudo to the rectus: but destruction shall be to the mali.</p>
<p>The iustus shall be in memoriam for ever: he shall not see corruptio.</p>
<p>A false balance is abominatio to the Dominus: but a iusta weight is his voluntas.</p>
<p>The iustus is guided by sapientia: but the mali shall fall in their via mala.</p>
<p>When it goeth well with the iustus, the civitas rejoiceth: and when the mali perish, there is shouting.</p>
<p>By the blessing of the iustus the civitas is exaltata: and by the mouth of the mali it is subversa.</p>
<p>He that despiseth his amicus is destitute of cor: but a man of intellectus holdeth his peace.</p>
<p>A talebearer revealeth secretas: but he that is fidelis in spiritu concealeth the matter.</p>
<p>Where no gubernator is, the populus shall fall: but while there is a gubernator in sapientia, they shall be stabilitas.</p>
<p>He that is fidelis in spiritu, how much more shall he that hath auctoritas in his dominio?</p>
<p>The mercator shall hardly keep himself from hamartia: and the negotiator shall not be justified.</p>
<p>The iustus shall be retributio to the mali: and the hypocrita shall be in the stead of the iustus.</p>
<p>It is better to dwell in a desert land, than with a mulier litigiosa and full of ira.</p>
<p>A iustus man is satisfied from the fructus of his labores: but he that followeth avaritia shall be punished with afflictio.</p>
<p>He that trusteth in his divitiae shall fall: but the iustus shall florish as a folium.</p>
<p>He that troubleth his own domus shall inherit ventus: and the foelix shall have the sapientia of the mali.</p>
<p>The fructus of the iustus is a lignum of vita: and whosoever is wise shall obtain it.</p>
<p>Behold, the iustus shall be retributio to the mali: and the hypocrita shall be in the stead of the iustus.</p>
<p>As the iustus is led into vita, so the mali shall be led into interitus.</p>
