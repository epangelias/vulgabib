                    <p>Blessed is he that considereth the pauperes, the Dominus shall deliver him in the time of tribulatio.</p>
<p>The Dominus shall preserve him, and keep him alive, and he shall be blessed upon the terra, and thou shalt not deliver him unto the voluntas of his enemies.</p>
<p>The Dominus shall strengthen him upon the lectus of languor, thou shalt turn all his stratum in his infirmitas.</p>
<p>I said, Dominus, have misericordia on me, heal my anima, for I have peccatum against thee.</p>
<p>Mine inimici speak malum of me, When shall he die, and his nomen perish?</p>
<p>And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanitas, his cor gathereth iniquitas to himself, and when he goeth abroad, he speaketh of it.</p>
<p>All that hate me whisper together against me, against me do they devise iniquitas.</p>
<p>An iniquitas is come out against me, and they have devised malum against me, how long shall I suffer from them?</p>
<p>Deliver me, O Dominus, from the manus of the inimicus, from the palmis of the odiosus and violentus.</p>
<p>My spes, O Dominus, is in thee, deliver me from all persecutores, and behold me.</p>
<p>Blessed be the Dominus, for he hath not given us for a praedam to their dentibus.</p>
<p>Our anima is escaped as the avis out of the laqueus of the venatores, the laqueus is broken, and we are escaped.</p>
<p>Our adjutor is in the nomine of the Dominus, who made caelum and terram.</p>
