                    <p>And the LORD spake unto Moses, say, Unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Let my populus (people) go, that they may servire (serve) me.</p>
<p>And if thou refusus (refuse) to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy fines (borders) with ranas (frogs).</p>
<p>And the rana (frog) shall come up both upon thee, and upon thy populus (people), and upon all thy servos (servants).</p>
<p>Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Precate (pray) ye unto the LORD, that he may take away the ranas (frogs) from me, and from my populus (people); and I will let the populus (people) go, that they may sacrificare (sacrifice) unto the LORD.</p>
<p>And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory in this, I pray thee, over me: when shall I precare (pray) for thee, and for thy servos (servants), and for thy populus (people), to destroy the ranas (frogs) from thee and thy domus (houses), that they may remain in the flumen (river) only?</p>
<p>And he said, Cras (tomorrow). And he said, Be it according to thy verbum (word): that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the LORD our Deus (God).</p>
<p>And the rana (frog) shall depart from thee, and from thy domus (houses), and from thy servos (servants), and from thy populus (people); they shall remain in the flumen (river) only.</p>
<p>And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses clamavit (cried) unto the LORD because of the ranas (frogs) which he had brought against Pharaoh.</p>
<p>And the LORD did according to the verbum (word) of Moses; and the ranas (frogs) died out of the domus (houses), out of the villae (villages), and out of the agri (fields).</p>
<p>And they gathered them together upon heaps: and the terra (earth) stank.</p>
<p>But when Pharaoh saw that there was respiratio (relief), he hardinavit (hardened) his cor (heart), and hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had dixit (spoken).</p>
<p>And the LORD said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thy virgam (rod), and smite the pulvis (dust) of the terra (earth), that it may be scinifes (lice) throughout all the terra (earth) of Aegyptus (Egypt).</p>
<p>And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his manus (hand) with his virgam (rod), and smote the pulvis (dust) of the terra (earth), and it became scinifes (lice) in hominibus (men), and in jumentis (beasts); all the pulvis (dust) of the terra (earth) became scinifes (lice) throughout all the terra (earth) of Aegyptus (Egypt).</p>
<p>And the magi (magicians) did so with their incantationes (incantations) to bring forth scinifes (lice), but they could not: so there were scinifes (lice) upon hominibus (men), and upon jumentis (beasts).</p>
<p>Then the magi (magicians) said unto Pharaoh, This is the digitus (finger) of Deus (God): and Pharaoh's cor (heart) was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had dixit (spoken).</p>
<p>And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the mane (morning), and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my populus (people) go, that they may servire (serve) me.</p>
<p>Else, if thou wilt not let my populus (people) go, behold, I will send all my regiones (regions) upon thy fines (borders), upon thy populus (people), and upon thy domus (houses): and the domus (houses) of the Aegyptii (Egyptians) shall be full of muscae (flies), and also the terra (earth) wherein they are.</p>
<p>And I will sever in that die (day) the terra (earth) of Gessen (Goshen), in which my populus (people) dwell, that no musca (fly) shall be there; to the end thou mayest know that I am the LORD in the midst of the terra (earth).</p>
<p>And I will put a divisio (division) between my populus (people) and thy populus (people): to morrow shall this signum (sign) be.</p>
<p>And the LORD did so; and there came a gravissima (very grievous) swarm of muscae (flies) into the domus (house) of Pharaoh, and into his servos (servants), and into all the terra (earth) of Aegyptus (Egypt): the terra (earth) was corrupted by reason of the muscae (flies).</p>
<p>And Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Go and sacrificare (sacrifice) to your Deus (God) in the terra (earth).</p>
<p>And Moses said, It is not conveniens (convenient) so to do; for we shall sacrificare (sacrifice) the abomination of the Aegyptii (Egyptians) to the LORD our Deus (God): lo, shall we sacrificare (sacrifice) the abomination of the Aegyptii (Egyptians) before their oculis (eyes), and they will not lapidare (stone) us?</p>
<p>We will go three dies (days) journey into the desert, and sacrificare (sacrifice) to the LORD our Deus (God), as he shall praecipere (command) us.</p>
<p>And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrificare (sacrifice) to the LORD your Deus (God) in the deserto (desert); only ye shall not go very far away: precate (pray) for me.</p>
<p>And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will precare (pray) unto the LORD that the muscae (flies) may depart from Pharaoh, from his servos (servants), and from his populus (people), to morrow: but let not Pharaoh deal fraudulenter (fraudulently) any more in not letting the populus (people) go to sacrificare (sacrifice) unto the LORD.</p>
<p>And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and precavit (prayed) unto the LORD.</p>
<p>And the LORD did according to the verbum (word) of Moses; and he removed the muscas (flies) from Pharaoh, from his servos (servants), and from his populus (people); there remained not one.</p>
<p>And Pharaoh hardinavit (hardened) his cor (heart), this time also, neither would he let the populus (people) go.</p>
