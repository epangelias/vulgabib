  "1 Then came to me all the princes, saying, Observe, we have heard that king Zedekiah hath made thee prophet, dicens, Thus saith Dominus, saying, Turn ye again now every one from his malum way, and amend your manus, that ye may dwell in this terra, which Dominus hath given to you and to your patres for ever and ever.",
  "2 Thus dicens, If ye will indeed turn again now, and make a vow to obey the vox of Dominus your Deus, and to serve him with all your cor, and with all your animus.",
  "3 And if ye will not turn again, this is what Dominus saith unto me, Dicens, Behold I will give this civitas into manus of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with ignis.",
  "4 And though thou, Zedekiah rex, and thy milites, fight against the king of Babylon, ye shall not escape out of his manus, saith Dominus.",
  "5 For thus dicens, Dominus, Behold I will give the civitas into manus of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it.",
  "6 And Hananiah rex spake to Jeremiah propheta before the eyes of the sacerdotes, and in the aures of all the populus, that were in domus Domini,",
  "7 Yea, dicens, Thus speaketh Dominus, rex of Israel, Behold I will break the jugum of the king of Babylon from the cervix of all gentes within the space of duobus annis.",
  "8 And the propheta Jeremiah went his way.",
  "9 Then said the propheta Hananiah to propheta Jeremiah, Hear now, Jeremiah, why dost thou dicens, Thus saith Dominus, Behold I will break the jugum of the king of Babylon from the cervix of all gentes.",
  "10 And Hananiah propheta took the jugum from the cervix of propheta Jeremiah, and brake it.",
  "11 And the propheta Hananiah spake in the aures of all the populus, dicens, Thus saith Dominus; Even so will I break the jugum of king Nebuchadnezzar rex of Babylon from the cervix of all gentes within the space of duobus annis.",
  "12 Then the word of Dominus came unto the propheta Jeremiah after Hananiah propheta had broken the jugum from off the cervix of the propheta, dicens,",
  "13 Go and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus saith Dominus; Thou hast broken the lignum jugum, but thou shalt make for it a jugum of ferrum.",
  "14 For thus saith Dominus rex of Israel, I have put a jugum of ferrum upon the cervix of all these gentes, that they may serve the king of Babylon; and they shall serve him: and I have given him the bestias of the ager also.",
  "15 Then said the propheta Jeremiah to propheta Hananiah, Hear now, Hananiah; Dominus hath not sent thee; but thou makest this populus to trust in mendacium.",
  "16 Therefore thus saith Dominus; Behold, I will cast thee from the facies of the terra: this year thou shalt die, because thou hast spoken rebellio against Dominus.",
  "17 So Hananiah propheta died the same year in the seventh mense.",
  "18 Then said Jeremiah to Zedekiah rex, Thus saith Dominus; If thou wilt hearken unto the vox of Dominus thy Deus, and make a vow to obey his voluntas, and to serve him with all thy cor, and with all thy animus;"
