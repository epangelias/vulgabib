  "Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said, Deus non impunitus relinquere malos.",
  "Therefore he knoweth their works, and turneth them over in the nocte, so that they are destroyed.",
  "He cutteth off the spiritus of princes, and is terrible to the reges of the earth.",
  "If he set him in muros, he cannot escape: if he enclose him in muros, he cannot break forth:",
  "When he giveth quietus, who then can condemn? when he hideth his facies, who then can behold him?",
  "Whether it be done against a terra, or against men only.",
  "Behold, mine eye hath seen all this, mine auris hath heard and understood it.",
  "What ye know, the same do I know also: I am not inferior unto you.",
  "Surely I would speak to the Deus, I would order my causam to him:",
  "And surely he shall reprehend you, if ye do secretly accept personarum.",
  "Shall he not then have respect unto your hypocritas, and according to your multitudo of iniustitias?",
  "For your avaritia shall be punished, and ye shall have salvus from your rapina.",
  "Your memoria shall perish, as a rivus that is destroyed, and as a tabernaculum which is plucked down:",
  "This is the pars of a wicked man with Deus, and the hereditas of oppressores, which they shall receive of the Dominus.",
  "If his children be multiplied, it is for the gladius: and his posteritas shall not be satisfied with panem.",
  "Those that remain of him shall be sepulti in morte, and his viduae shall not weep.",
  "Though he heap up argentum as the terra, and prepare vestes as the lutum;",
  "He may prepare it, but the iustus shall indure it, and the innocens shall divide the argentum.",
  "For he hath known no quies, in his vita, he hath saved up all that he might buticare, and it shall perish together with him.",
  " Labour shall be sent upon him, and he shall be deceived thereby: he shall reign among his fratribus, and it shall not prosper.",
  "When he shall prepare the via, I will set my facies against him.",
  "He shall not escape by flying: wickedness shall be his oppressio, and the manus of the wicked shall press him down.",
  "He shall be sent into the flamma, and all that is his, shall be destroyed by the gelidus.",
  "The fundamentum of his domus shall be in pulverem and in cineres, a tempestas shall sweep away the tabernaculum of the wicked.",
  "This is the pars of a wicked man from Deus, and the hereditas of his eloquio, which he hath received of the Dominus in ira, because of the scelus of his manus, and the malum which he hath done in medio eius."
