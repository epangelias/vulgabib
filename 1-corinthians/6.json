  "Dare any of you, having a materia (matter) against another, go to law before the injusti (unjust), and not before the sancti (saints)?",
  "Do you not know that the sancti (saints) shall judge the mundus (world)? and if the mundus (world) shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest materia (matter)?)",
  "Know ye not that we shall judge angelos (angels)? how much more materia (matter) of this vita (life)?",
  "If then ye have judicia (judgments) of things pertaining to this vita (life), set them to judge who are least esteemed in the Ecclesia (Church).",
  "I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a sapiens (wise man) among you? no, not one that shall be able to put a materia (matter) between his fratres (brethren)?",
  "But fratres (brother) goeth to law with fratres (brother), and that before infideles (infidels).",
  "Now therefore there is utterly a defectus (defect) in you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take the injuria (injury)?)",
  "Why do ye not rather suffer yourself to be defraudati (defrauded)?",
  "Nay, ye do injuriam (injury), and defraud, and that your fratres (brethren).",
  "Know ye not that the injusti (unjust) shall not inherit the regnum (kingdom) of Deus (God)? Be not errati (deceived): neither fornicatores (fornicators), nor idolis servi (servants of idols), nor adulteri (adulterers), nor molles (effeminate), nor masculorum concubitores (abusers of themselves with mankind),",
  "Nor fures (thieves), nor avari (covetous), nor ebriosi (drunkards), nor maledici (revilers), nor raptores (extortioners) shall inherit the regnum (kingdom) of Deus (God).",
  "And such were some of you: but ye are lavati (washed), but ye are sanctificati (sanctified), but ye are justificati (justified) in the nomine (name) of the Dominus (Lord) Jesus Christus (Christ), and by the Spiritus (Spirit) of our Deus (God).",
  "All things are licita (lawful) unto me, but all things are not expediens (expedient): all things are licita (lawful) for me, but I will not be subditus (subject) to any materia (matter).",
  "Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but Deus (God) shall destroy both it and them. Now the corpus (body) is not for fornicatio (fornication), but for the Dominus (Lord); and the Dominus (Lord) for the corpus (body).",
  "And Deus (God) hath both raised up the Dominus (Lord), and will also raise up us by his potentia (power).",
  "Know ye not that your corpora (bodies) are the membra (members) of Christus (Christ)? shall I then take the membra (members) of Christus (Christ), and make them the membra (members) of a meretrix (harlot)? Absit (God forbid).",
  "What? know ye not that he which is conjunctus (joined) to a meretrix (harlot) is unum corpus (one body)? for two, saith he, shall be in uno carne (one flesh).",
  "But he that is conjunctus (joined) unto the Dominus (Lord) is unus spiritus (one spirit).",
  "Fugite (Flee) fornicationem (fornication). Every peccatum (sin) that a homo (man) doeth is sine (without) the corpus (body); but he that committeth fornicationem (fornication) sinit (sinneth) against his proprium corpus (own body).",
  "What? know ye not that your corpus (body) is the templum (temple) of the Spiritus (Spirit) Sancti (Holy) which is in you, which ye have of Deus (God), and ye are not your own?",
  "For ye are empti (bought) with a pretium (price): therefore glorificate (glorify) Deus (God) in your corpus (body), and in your spiritus (spirit), which are Dei (God's)."
