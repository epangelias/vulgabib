                    <p>My Deus, my Deus, why hast thou forsaken me? why art thou so far from helping me, and from the words of my clamor?</p>
<p>O my Deus, I cry in the daytime, but thou hearest not; and in the nocte, I am not silent.</p>
<p>But thou art sanctus, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel.</p>
<p>Our patres trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst liberare them.</p>
<p>They cried unto thee, and were saved: they trusted in thee, and were not confusus.</p>
<p>But I am a vermis, and no homo; a reproach of homines, and despised of the populus.</p>
<p>All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the labia, they shake the caput, saying,</p>
<p>He trusted on the Dominus that he would liberare him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.</p>
<p>But thou art he that took me out of the ventre: thou didst make me hope when I was upon my mater's ubera.</p>
<p>I was cast upon thee from the ventre: thou art my Deus from my mater's ventre.</p>
<p>Be not far from me; for tribulatio is near; for there is none to help.</p>
<p>Many bulls have circled around me: strong bulls of Bashan have circled around me.</p>
<p>They gaped upon me with their os: as a ravening and a roaring leo.</p>
<p>I am poured out like aqua, and all my ossa are out of iunctura: my cor is like cera, it is melted in the midst of my ventres.</p>
<p>My lingua cleaveth to my fauces; and thou hast brought me into the pulvis of morte.</p>
<p>For canes have circled around me: the assembly of the malus have inclosed me: they pierced my manus and pedes.</p>
<p>I may tell all my ossa: they look and stare upon me.</p>
<p>They part my vestimenta among them, and cast lots upon my vestis.</p>
<p>But be not thou far from me, O Domine: O my fortitudo, hasten thee to help me.</p>
<p>Deliver my anima from the gladius: my unicam from the potens cane.</p>
<p>Save me from the ore of the leo: and from the cornua of the unicornis.</p>
<p>I will declare thy nomen unto my fratres: in the midst of the ecclesia will I praise thee.</p>
<p>Ye that fear the Dominus, praise him; all ye the semen of Iacob, glorify him; and fear him, all ye the semen of Israel.</p>
<p>For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the pauper; neither hath he hid his facies from him; but when he cried unto him, he heard.</p>
<p>My laudem shall be of thee in the great ecclesia: I will pay my vota before them that fear him.</p>
<p>The pauper shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the Dominus that seek him: your cor shall live for ever.</p>
<p>All the fines of the terra shall remember and turn unto the Dominus: and all the kindreds of the gentes shall worship before thee.</p>
<p>For the regnum is the Domini's: and he is the Dominus of the gentes.</p>
<p>All they that be fat upon terra shall eat and worship: all they that go down to the pulvis shall bow before him: and none can keep his anima alive.</p>
<p>A semen shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Dominus for a generatio.</p>
<p>They shall come, and shall declare his iustitia unto a populus that shall be born, that he hath done this.</p>
