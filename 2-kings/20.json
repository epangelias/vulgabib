  "1 In those days was Hezekiah sick unto the death. And the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him, Thus saith Dominus, Set thine house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live.",
  "2 Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto Dominus, saying, 3 I beseech thee, O Dominus, remember now how I have walked before thee in veritas and with a perfect cor, and have done that which is bonus in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.",
  "4 And it came to pass, afore Isaiah was gone out into the middle court, that the word of Dominus came to him, saying, 5 Turn again, and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people, Thus saith Dominus, the Deus of David thy pater, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will heal thee: on the third day thou shalt go up unto the domus of Dominus.",
  "6 And I will add unto thy dies fifteen annus: and I will deliver thee and this city out of the manu of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.",
  "7 And Isaiah said, Take a lump of figs. And they took and laid it on the boil, and he recovered.",
  "8 And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, What shall be the sign that Dominus will heal me, and that I shall go up into the domus of Dominus the third day?",
  "9 And Isaiah said, This sign shalt thou have of Dominus, that Dominus will do the thing that he hath spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees?",
  "10 And Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees: nay, but let the shadow return backward ten degrees.",
  "11 And Isaiah the prophet cried unto Dominus: and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the dial of Ahaz.",
  "12 At that time Berodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a donum unto Hezekiah: for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.",
  "13 And Hezekiah hearkened unto them, and shewed them all the domus of his treasures, the argentum and the aurum, and the spices, and the precious unguent, and all the domus of his armour, and all that was found in his thesauri: there was nothing in his domus, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah shewed them not.",
  "14 Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him, What said these homines? and from whence came they unto thee? And Hezekiah said, They came from a far terra, even from Babylon.",
  "15 And he said, What have they seen in thine domus? And Hezekiah answered, All the things that are in mine domus have they seen: there is nothing among my thesauri that I have not shewed them.",
  "16 And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah, Hear the word of Dominus.",
  "17 Behold, the dies come, that all that is in thine domus, and that which thy patres have laid up in store unto this day, shall be carried into Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith Dominus.",
  "18 And of thy filii that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palatium of the king of Babylon.",
  "19 Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, Good is the word of Dominus which thou hast spoken. And he said, Is it not good, if peace and veritas be in my dies?",
  "20 And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how he made a piscina, and a canal, and brought aqua into the civitas, are they not written in the libro of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?",
  "21 And Hezekiah slept with his patres: and Manasseh his filius reigned in his stead."
