                    <p>Preserve me, O Deus, for in thee do I put my trust.</p>
<p>O my soul, thou hast said unto the Dominus, Thou art my Deus: for thou hast no reward above.</p>
<p>As for the sancti, who are in the terra, they are the excellent, in whom is all my delicia.</p>
<p>Their idola have multiplied their afflictions: afterwards they hastened to offer their sacrificia to the simulacra.</p>
<p>Their libamina of wine I will not offer, nor take the nomina of their idola into my labia.</p>
<p>The Dominus is the pars of mine hereditas and of my calix: thou maintainest my sortem.</p>
<p>The linea are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a good hereditas.</p>
<p>Blessed be the Dominus, who hath given me counsel: therefore my reins also instruct me in nocte seasons.</p>
<p>I have set the Dominus always before me: because he is at my dexter hand, I shall not be moved.</p>
<p>Therefore my cor is glad, and my gloria rejoiceth: my caro also shall rest in spem.</p>
<p>For thou wilt not leave my anima in infernus; neither wilt thou suffer thy Sanctus to see corruptio.</p>
<p>Thou wilt shew me the semita of vita: in thy praesentia is plenitudo of gaudium; at thy dexter hand there are deliciae for evermore.</p>
