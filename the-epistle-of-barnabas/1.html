                    <p>Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in ordinem the narration of those things which are most surely believed among us,</p>
<p>they handed them down unto us, who from the principio saw and were ministers of the Word;</p>
<p>it seemed good also to me, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto thee in ordinem, most excellent Theophilus,</p>
<p>that thou mightest know the certitudo of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed.</p>
<p>Therefore, as many as were the prophets among us also gave testimony of the gratia of God,</p>
<p>which was to be distributed among the gentes, through Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom be gloria for ever and ever.</p>
<p>Of the ministry of the apostles, therefore, and of theospel which God had promised by the prophets,</p>
<p>we have been made partakers, and we have been made servants also of the gospel,</p>
<p>to the end that the promise of the Spirit, which was made by the gospel, might be fulfilled;</p>
<p>even as it is written in the Psalm, 'Many are the afflictions of the just, and the Lord hath delivered them out of them all.'</p>
<p>For it is written, 'Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn.' Deus enim non est iniustus, that He should forget the work and the labour of love which is shown towards His Name,</p>
<p>seeing that He Himself hath said, 'Not all who say unto Me, Lord, Lord, shall be saved, but they who do the voluntas of My Father which is in caelis.'</p>
