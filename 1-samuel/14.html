                    <p>Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bare his armour, Veni, let us go over to the Philistines' garrison, that is on the other side. But he told not his father.</p>
<p>And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people that were with him were about six hundred men;</p>
<p>And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the Lord's sacerdos in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.</p>
<p>And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines' garrison, there was a sharp rock on the one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.</p>
<p>The one rock rose up on the one side of the passage, and the other on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.</p>
<p>Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Ascend, let us go over unto the garrison of these incircumcisi, it may be that the Lord will work for us: for there is no impediment to the Lord to save by many or by few.</p>
<p>And his armourbearer said unto him, Fac quodcumque vis, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.</p>
<p>And Jonathan said, Ecce, we will pass over unto these homines, and we will shew ourselves unto them.</p>
<p>If they say thus unto us, Tace, until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not ascend unto them.</p>
<p>But if they say thus, Ascend unto us; then we will ascend: for the Lord hath delivered them into our manūs. And this shall be a sign unto us.</p>
<p>So both of them shewed themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Ecce, the Hebraei come forth out of the cavernae, where they had hid themselves.</p>
<p>And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armourbearer, and said, Ascend unto us, and we will shew you something. And Jonathan said unto his armourbearer, Ascend after me: for the Lord hath delivered them into the manūs of Israel.</p>
<p>And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armourbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armourbearer slew them after him.</p>
<p>And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer made, was about twenty homines, within as it were half an acre of land, which a yoke of oxen might plow.</p>
<p>And there was a tremor in the castrum, and in the ager: and it was perceived that the tumultus was magna, and that there was a cœdes, and that the earth was amisit.</p>
<p>And Saul said unto the people that were with him, Numera, I pray you, and see who is absent from us. And when they had numerated, ecce, Jonathan and his armourbearer were not there.</p>
<p>And Saul said unto Ahiah, Applica arcam Dei. For the ark of God was at that time with the filios Israel.</p>
<p>And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the sacerdos, that the tumultus that was in the castrum of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said unto the sacerdos, Retrahe tuam manum.</p>
<p>And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled themselves, and they came to the battle: and, ecce, every man's gladius was against his socius, and there was a very great tumultus.</p>
<p>Moreover the Hebraei that were with the Philistines before that time, who went up with them into the castrum, even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan.</p>
<p>Likewise all the homines of Israel which had hid themselves in mount Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle.</p>
<p>So the Lord saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over unto Bethaven.</p>
<p>And the homines of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had adjurated the people, saying, Maledictus vir qui comederit panem usque ad vesperam, that I may be avenged on my inimici. So none of the people tasted panem.</p>
<p>And all they of the ager came to a saltus, and ecce, there was mel super faciem agri.</p>
<p>And when the people were come into the saltus, ecce, the mel dropped; but no man put his manus unto his os: for the people feared the juramentum.</p>
<p>But Jonathan heard not when his pater adjurated the people: therefore he put forth the summitas of his baculus, and dipped it in a favus melis, and put his manus to his os; and his oculi were illuminati.</p>
<p>Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy pater adjurated the people, saying, Maledictus vir qui comederit panem hodie. And the people were fatigati.</p>
<p>Then said Jonathan, My pater hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how mine oculi are illuminated, because I tasted a little of this mel.</p>
<p>How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the spoil of their inimici which they found? for had there not been now a much greater victoria?</p>
<p>And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon: and the people were very fatigati.</p>
<p>And the people flew upon the spoil, and took oviculās, and pecora, and boves, and mactaverunt them in terra, and ate them cum sanguine.</p>
<p>Then they told Saul, saying, Ecce, the people sin against the Lord, in that they eat cum sanguine. And he said, Ye have transgressed: roll a great petram unto me this day.</p>
<p>And Saul said, Dispergite vos inter populum, and say unto them, Bring me every manās his bovem, and every manās his oviculam, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against the Lord in eating cum sanguine. So they brought every man his bovem in his manus, and slew them there.</p>
<p>And Saul built an altare unto the Lord: he built that altare at that time, when he first began to regnare over Israel.</p>
<p>And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by nocte, and spoil them until the morning light, and leave them not a vir. And they said, Omnia quae placuerint in oculis tuis, fac. But the sacerdos said, Appropinquemus huc ad Deum.</p>
<p>And Saul inquired of God, Utrum debeam descendere post Philistino, et si tradas eos in manūs Israel? Sed non respondit ei in illo die.</p>
<p>Then said Saul, Congregamini hic universi principes populi, et scitote et videte, quae sit peccatum, quod factum sit hodie?</p>
<p>Vivit Dominus, qui salvavit Israel, quia si reperiam in Jonatha, filio meo, morietur. Quod nullus contradixit ei ex omnibus populis.</p>
<p>Et ait ad universum Israel, Vos estis in parte una, et ego cum Jonatha, filio meo, in parte altera. Dominus autem est testis in Israel.</p>
<p>Respondit autem populus, Absit a te, ut moriatur: non enim factum est hodie opus in Israel. Et liberavit eum populus de manibus Saul, et non est mortuus in illo die.</p>
<p>Saul autem recessit, et non persecutus est Philistinos, et reversi sunt in loca sua.</p>
<p>Saul obtinuit regnum super Israel, et pugnavit in circuitu contra omnes inimicos suos, contra Moab, et contra filios Ammon, et contra Edom, et contra reges Soba, et contra Philistinos, et quocumque se verterat, vincens vincabat.</p>
<p>Et congregavit virtutem, et percussit Amalech, et eruit Israel de manu praedatoris, qui eos vexabat.</p>
<p>Fuerunt autem filii Saul, Jonatha, et Jesui, et Melchisa, et filiae duae, nomine prima Merob, et nomine secunda Michol.</p>
<p>Nomen autem uxoris Saul, Ahinoem filia Ahimaaz, erat. Et nomen principis militiae, Abner, erat filius Ner, patrui Saul.</p>
<p>Cineres autem, pater Saul, et Cis, pater Abner, fuerunt. Et bella Saul, omni tempore, quibus pugnavit contra omnes inimicos suos, contra Moab, et contra filios Ammon, et Edom, et contra reges Soba, et contra Philistinos, et quocumque se verterat, vincens vincabat.</p>
