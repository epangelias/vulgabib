  "And it came to pass, when all the gentes of Amor, which were on the side of Jordan westward, and all the Canaanites, which were by the mare, heard that the Dominus had dried up the aquas of Jordan from before the filii of Israel, until they were passed over, that their cor was melted, neither was there in them any spirit, because of the filii of Israel.",
  "At that time the Dominus said unto Joshua, Fac (Make) thee sharp knives, and circumcise again the filii of Israel the secundam.",
  "And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the filii of Israel at the colles of prepucii.",
  "And this is the causa why Joshua circumcised: All the populus that came out of Aegypto, that were masculi, all the viri of war, died in deserto by the via after they came out of Aegypto.",
  "For all the populus that came out were circumcised: but all the populus that were born in deserto by the via as they came out of Aegypto, them they had not circumcised.",
  "For the filii of Israel walked quattuordecim dies in deserto of the mare, to compass the land of Edom: and the populus began to be impatient, and to murmur against Deus and against Moses, and said, Quid enim deduxistis nos de Aegypto, ut occideritis nos in deserto? nonne hic panis, et hic potus, et quid est, quod ascendimus de Aegypto, ut adduceretis nos in locum istum, in quo non est, neque panis, neque potus, et in quo anima nostra oneratur?",
  "Then the Dominus said unto Joshua, This dies circumcisio palpebrarum tuarum.",
  "And the filii of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and celebrated Pascha on the decimum quartum dies of the mense, at vespera, in planitie Jericho.",
  "And they did eat of the fruges of the terra on the crastino Paschatis, panem infermentatum, and frumenta tosta.",
  "And the manna cessavit a filiis Israel postquam coeperunt comedere de frugibus terrae, nec ultra habuerunt manna, sed de frugibus terrae comederunt, anni ilius, in terra Chanaan.",
  "And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his oculi, and vidit, and ecce vir stans contra eum, gladiusque evaginatus in manu sua: et Joshua abiit ad eum, et dixit ei: Tune es ex nobis, an ex adversariis?",
  "Qui respondit: Neque, sed sum princeps exercitus Domini, nunc veni.",
  "Et Joshua cecidit in faciem suam in terra, et adoravit, et dixit ei: Quid dominus meus loquitur ad servum suum?",
  "Et dixit princeps exercitus Domini ad Joshua: Solve calciamentum de pedibus tuis, quia locus, in quo stas, sanctus est."
