                    <p>1 And they came over unto the other side of the mare, into the region of the Gadarenes.</p>
<p>2 And when he was come out of the navis, immediately there met him out of the monumenta a man with an immundus spirit,</p>
<p>3 Who had his domus in the monumenta of the sepulchra; and no man could bind him, no, not with catenae:</p>
<p>4 Because that he had often been bound with catenae and with compedes, and the catenae had been made asunder by him, and the compedes broken in pieces: neither could any man tame him.</p>
<p>5 And always, night and day, he was in the sepulchra, and in the montes, crying out, and cutting himself with lapides.</p>
<p>6 But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him,</p>
<p>7 And cried with a great voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, filius Dei omnipotentis? I adjure thee by Deus, that thou torment me not.</p>
<p>8 For he said unto him, Come out of the homo, thou immundus spirit.</p>
<p>9 And he asked him, Quod tibi nomen est? And he answered, saying, My nomen is Legion: for we are multi.</p>
<p>10 And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the region.</p>
<p>11 Now there was there nigh unto the montes a great agmen of porci feeding.</p>
<p>12 And all the daemones besought him, saying, Send us into the porci, that we may enter into them.</p>
<p>13 And forthwith Jesus gave them potestas. And the immundi spiritus went out, and entered into the porci: and the agmen ran violently down a precipice into the mare, and were suffocati in the mare.</p>
<p>14 And they that fed the porci fled, and told it in the civitas and in the villae. And they went out to see what it was that was factum.</p>
<p>15 And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the daemonium, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his sensus, and they were timidi.</p>
<p>16 And they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the daemonium, and also concerning the porci.</p>
<p>17 And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts.</p>
<p>18 And when he was come into the navis, he that had been possessed with the daemonium prayed him that he might be with him.</p>
<p>19 Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go home to thy domus, to thy amici, and tell them how great things the Dominus hath done for thee, and hath had misericordia on thee.</p>
<p>20 And he departed, and began to preach in the Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him: and all men did mirari.</p>
<p>21 And when Jesus was passed over again by navis unto the other side, much turba gathered unto him: and he was nigh unto the mare.</p>
<p>22 And, behold, there cometh one of the archisynagogi of the synagoga, named Jairus, and when he saw him, he fell at his pedes,</p>
<p>23 And besought him greatly, saying, My filia is at the extremum: I pray thee, come and lay thy manus upon her, that she may be sana, and live.</p>
<p>24 And Jesus went with him; and much turba followed him, and thronged him.</p>
<p>25 And a mulier, which had a fluxum sanguinis twelve anni,</p>
<p>26 And had suffered many things of many medicos, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse,</p>
<p>27 When she had heard of Jesus, came in the turba behind, and touched his vestimenta.</p>
<p>28 For she said, If I may touch but his vestimenta, I shall be sana.</p>
<p>29 And straightway the fons of her sanguis was dried up; and she felt in her corpus that she was sana of the plaga.</p>
<p>30 And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtus had gone out of him, turned him about in the turba, and said, Quis me tetigit?</p>
<p>31 And his discipuli said unto him, Thou seest the turba thronging thee, and sayest thou, Quis me tetigit?</p>
<p>32 And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing.</p>
<p>33 But the mulier fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the veritas.</p>
<p>34 And he said unto her, Filia, thy fides hath made thee sana: go in pace, and be sana of thy plaga.</p>
<p>35 While he yet spake, there came from the domus of the archisynagogi certain who said, Thy filia is mortua: why troublest thou the Magister any further?</p>
<p>36 As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith unto the archisynagogi, Ne timeas, tantummodo crede.</p>
<p>37 And he suffered no man to follow him, save Petrus, and Jacobus, and Johannes frater Jacobus.</p>
<p>38 And he cometh to the domus of the archisynagogi, and seeth the tumult, and them that plorabant, and flent.</p>
<p>39 And when he was come in, he saith unto them, Why make ye this tumult, and plorate? the puella is not mortua, but dormit.</p>
<p>40 And they deridebant him: but he putteth them all out, and taketh the pater and the mater of the puella, and them that were with him, and entereth in where the puella was lying.</p>
<p>41 And he took the manus of the puella, and saith unto her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Puella, tibi dico, surge.</p>
<p>42 And straightway the puella arose, and walked; for she was of twelve anni. And they were astonished with a magnus admiration.</p>
<p>43 And he charged them straitly that no man should know it; and commanded to give her cibus to eat.</p>
