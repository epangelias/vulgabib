  "And when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of panis, and an centum bunches of uvas, and an centum of granatum.",
  "And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba said, The asses be for the king's familia to ride on; and the panis and the granatum for the king's familia to eat; and the uvas for the king's familia to drink, and for those that are faint in the desert.",
  "And the king said, And where is thy domine Mephibosheth? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Hierosolyma: for he said, To die, the regnum shall be returned to me to die, the domus of Saul.",
  "Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine is all that pertained unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly thank the rex; I will be thy servus.",
  "And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a man of the familia of the domus of Saul, whose name was Semei, the filius of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came.",
  "And he cast lapides at David, and at all the servos of king David: and all the populus and all the mighty men were on his dexter and sinister hand.",
  "And thus said Semei, when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou sanguinarius, and thou vir nequam, that thou hast destroyed the domus of Saul, and hast reigned in his statu.",
  "The Lord hath returned upon thee all the sanguis of the domus of Saul, in whose loco thou hast reigned; and the Lord hath delivered the regnum into the manus of Absalom thy filius: and, behold, thou art taken in thy malitia, because thou art a vir sanguinarius.",
  "Then said Abishai the filius of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should this canis mortuus curse my domine the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his caput.",
  "And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye filii of Zeruiah? so let him curse, because the Lord hath said unto him, Curse David. Who shall then say, Why hast thou done so?",
  "And David said to Abishai, and to all his servos, Behold, my filius, which came forth of my viscera, seeketh my anima: how much more now may this Benjamite do it? let him alone, and let him curse; for the Lord hath bidden him.",
  "It may be that the Lord shall look on mine affliction, and that the Lord shall requite me good for his malediction this die.",
  "So David and his homines went by the way; and Semei went along on the collis over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw lapides at him, and cast terra.",
  "And the king, and all the populus that were with him, came weary, and refreshed themselves there.",
  "And Absalom, and all the populus the viri of Israel, came to Hierosolyma, and Ahithophel with him.",
  "And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's amicus, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, Salve, rex, salve.",
  "And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy fides to thy amicus? why wentest thou not with thy amicus?",
  "And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom the Lord, and this populus, and all the viri of Israel choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide.",
  "And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the presence of his filius? as I have served in thy patris presence, so will I be with thee.",
  "Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we shall do.",
  "And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy patris concubinas, which he hath left to keep the domus; that all Israel may hear that thou art abhorred of thy patris: so shall the manus of all that are with thee be strengthened.",
  "So they spread Absalom a pavilion in the faciem of the domus, and Absalom went in unto his patris concubinas in the conspectus of all Israel.",
  "And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those dies, was as if a man had inquired at the oraculum of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom."
