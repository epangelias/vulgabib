                    <p>Hear my prayer, O Deus, give ear to my supplications: in thy fidelitas hear me, and in thy justitia answer me.</p>
<p>Enter not into judicium with thy servus: for in thy sight shall no man vivere be justified.</p>
<p>For the inimicus hath persecuted my anima; he hath crushed my vita to the terra; he hath made me to dwell in tenebrosa, as those that have been of old.</p>
<p>Therefore is my spirit vexed within me; and my cor is troubled.</p>
<p>I remember the dies of old; I meditate on all thy opera; I muse on the work of thy manus.</p>
<p>I stretch forth my manus unto thee: my anima thirsteth after thee, as a terra without water. Selah.</p>
<p>Hear me speedily, O Deus: my spirit faileth: hide not thy facies from me, lest I be like unto them that descend into sepulchrum.</p>
<p>Cause me to hear thy misericordia in the morning; for in thee do I trust: cause me to know the via wherein I should walk; for I lift up my anima unto thee.</p>
<p>Deliver me, O Deus, from mine inimici: for thou art my refugium.</p>
<p>Teach me to do thy voluntas; for thou art my Deus: thy Spirit bona shall lead me into terra recta.</p>
<p>Quicken me, O Deus, for thy nomen's sake: and for thy justitia's sake bring my anima out of tribulatio.</p>
<p>And for thy misericordia's sake destroy mine inimici: and destroy all them that afflict my anima; for I am thy servus.</p>
