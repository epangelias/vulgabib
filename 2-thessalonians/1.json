  "Paulus, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:",
  "Gratia vobis, et pax, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.",
  "We are bound to thank Deus for you, brethren, as it is meet, because that your fides groweth exceedingly, and the caritas of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth;",
  "So that we ourselves glory in you in the ecclesiis of God for your patience and fides in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure:",
  "Which is a manifestum signum of the just iudicium of Deus, that ye may be counted worthy of the regnum of God, for which ye also suffer:",
  "Seeing it is a just thing with Deus to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you;",
  "And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his potent angels,"
