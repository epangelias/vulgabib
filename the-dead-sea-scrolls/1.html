                    <p>In principio, God created the caelum and the terra.</p>
<p>And the terra was without forma, and void; and tenebrae was upon the facies of the profundum. And the Spiritus of God moved upon the facies of the aquae.</p>
<p>The earth was void, and vacuus; and tenebrae was upon the facies of the abyssus. And the Spiritus of God moved upon the facies of the aquae.</p>
<p>And God said, Fiat lux; and facta est lux.</p>
<p>And God saw the lux, that it was bonum; and God divided the lux from the tenebrae.</p>
<p>And God called the lux, Dies; and the tenebrae, he called Nox. And there was vespere, and there was mane, Dies unus.</p>
<p>And God said, Fiat firmamentum in medio aquarum; and it was so.</p>
<p>And God called the firmamentum, Caelum. And there was vespere, and there was mane, Dies secundus.</p>
<p>And God said, Congregentur aquae, quae sub caelo sunt, in locum unum; et appareat arida.</p>
<p>And it was so. And God called the arida, Terra; and congregationes aquarum, he called Maria.</p>
<p>And God saw that it was bonum.</p>
<p>And God said, Germinent terra herbam virentem, and facientem semen, and lignum pomiferum faciens fructum iuxta genus suum, cuius semen in semetipso sit super terram; et factum est ita.</p>
<p>And the terra produxit herbam virentem, and facientem semen iuxta genus suum, and lignum faciens fructum, et habens semen secundum genus suum; et vidit Deus quod esset bonum.</p>
<p>And there was vespere, and there was mane, Dies tertius.</p>
