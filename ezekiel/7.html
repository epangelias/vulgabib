                    <p>And the word of the Dominus came unto me, saying,</p>
<p>Also, thou son of man, thus saith the Dominus Deus; An end, the end is come upon the terra of Israel;</p>
<p>An end, I will send mine ira upon thee, and I will judge thee according to thy via, and will recompense upon thee all thine abomination.</p>
<p>And mine oculus shall not spare thee, neither will I have misericordia: but I will recompense thy via upon thee, and thine abomination shall be in the midst of thee: and ye shall know that I am the Dominus.</p>
<p>Thus saith the Dominus Deus; An affliction, one affliction, behold, it cometh.</p>
<p>An end is come, the end is come: it watcheth for thee; behold, it is come.</p>
<p>The pax is departed from the terra, and gaudium and laetitia out of the orbis terrarum.</p>
<p>Now will I shortly pour out my furor upon thee, and accomplish mine ira upon thee: and I will judge thee according to thy via, and will recompense thee for all thine abomination.</p>
<p>Neither shall mine oculus spare, neither will I have misericordia: I will recompense thee according to thy via and thine abomination that are in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I am the Dominus that smiteth.</p>
<p>Behold the dies, behold, it is come: the morning is gone forth; the virga is sprung forth, the arrogant one hath risen up:</p>
<p>Violentia is risen up into a virga of wickedness: there is none of them, nor of their multitude, nor of any of theirs: neither is there wailing for them.</p>
<p>The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn: for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.</p>
<p>For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they were yet alive: for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof, which shall not return; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his vita.</p>
<p>They have blown the buccina, even to make all ready; but none goeth to the battle: for my indignatio is upon all the multitude thereof.</p>
<p>The gladius is without, and the pestis and the fames within: he that is in the ager, he shall die by the gladius; and he that is in the urbs, famine and pestis shall devour him.</p>
<p>But they that escape of them shall escape, and shall be on the montes like the columbae of the valles, all of them mourning, every one for his iniquitas.</p>
<p>All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak as water:</p>
<p>They shall also gird themselves with sackcloth, and horror shall cover them; and shame shall be upon all faces, and baldness upon all their heads.</p>
<p>They shall cast their argentum in the strata, and their aurum shall be removed: their argentum and their aurum shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the indignatio of the Dominus: they shall not satisfy their appetitum, nor fill their ventres: because it is made the stumblingblock of their iniquitas.</p>
<p>As for the beauty of his ornatus, he set it in majesty: but they made images of their abomination and of their detestable things in it: therefore have I set it far from them.</p>
<p>And I will give it into the manu of the extraneus for spoil, and to the wicked of the terra for robbery, and they shall pollute it.</p>
<p>I will turn my facies from them, and they shall pollute my sanctuarium: for they have filled it with violence and blood; and I will make it gross with them.</p>
<p>And for the iniquity of the terra, I will make it desolate, that it may be gross with them.</p>
<p>This is the dies whereof I have spoken: and it shall come to pass in the urbs that is in Israel, saith the Dominus Deus; and it shall be the morning after the dies of the affliction.</p>
<p>The word of the Dominus came unto me in the morning after the dies of the affliction, saying,</p>
<p>Surely it cometh, and he shall know it, he that escapeth in that dies: the voice of their clamor is come to the auris of the Dominus Deus.</p>
