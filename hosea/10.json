  "Israel is an empty vine, he bringeth forth fruit unto himself: the more he brought forth, his fructus, the more altars he made unto the idola sua; the more bona his land produced, the more decori he made unto the imagines suas.",
  "Their cor is divided; now shall they be found culpabiles: the Dominus shall demolish their altaria, and destroy their imagines.",
  "Surely now they shall say, 'We have no rex, because we feared not the Dominus; what then should a rex do to us?'",
  "They have spoken verba, swearing falsely in making a foedus: thus iudicia shall spring up as hemlock in the sulcis agri.",
  "The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of Bethaven: for the populus thereof shall mourn over it, and the sacerdotes thereof that rejoiced on it, for the gloria thereof, because it is departed from it.",
  "It shall be also carried unto Assyria for a munus to rex Iareb: Ephraim shall receive donum, and Israel shall be confusus in his consilium.",
  "Samaria shall be desolata; for she hath rebelled against her Deus: they shall fall by gladius, their parvuli dashed in pieces, and their uteri rumpentur.",
  "He among the fratres hath devoratus the fructus of his terra, because they would not conversari cum Domino: therefore they shall eat ventus, and sequentur the imbrem, and non habebunt pluviam.",
  "Israel hath scattered on the montes, according to their voluntas: now shall they be gathered of the populus, for they were displicere Domino.",
  "The festae of the Domini shall be to them as the dies of the gentes, qui non agnoscunt verbum Domini: itaque adducam eos in tenebras, et in abyssum, et interficiam eos in gladio.",
  "Their civitas shall be desolata, and their aratrum non erit; et Israel recedet in captivitatem a facie malorum.",
  "Ephraim, quasi uxor adultera, non amat Dominum: iudicia Domini interficient eum in die visitationis Domini.",
  "In valle desolationis erit portio domus Israel secundum iudicium Domini."
