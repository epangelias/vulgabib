                    <p>He cried also in mine aures, saying, Thus shall the filii of Israel be in the midst of the terra, as olivae that are left, and as the racemus of a vine.</p>
<p>Then said he unto me, The ruina of the filii of Israel that are in captivity, and the tota terra that remaineth, are not they whose mens is turned from the Domini?</p>
<p>They have forsaken me, and polluted my sanctuarium, and have done more detestabile things than the gentes, and than those that are in circuitu eorum, and have followed the idolis of the gentes, and the idolis of the terra, to provocare me to ira.</p>
<p>Yet I will leave a reliquum of them, and give them in salutem out of the terra, and out of the loca in which they have been dispersi, and will put a timor in their cordibus, lest they should be exterminati in the terra in which they shall be in captivity.</p>
<p>And they shall know that I am the Domini, and that I have not spoken in vanum, when I shall have given them in salutem out of the terra of their inimici.</p>
<p>And I will gather you from the populis, and assemble you out of the terrae in which ye have been dispersi, and will give you the terra of Israel.</p>
<p>And they shall go thither, and take away all the abominationes of it, and all the detestabilia thereof from thence.</p>
<p>And I will give them a cor unum, and put a novus spiritus within you, and will take the cor lapideum out of their carne, and give them a cor carneum.</p>
<p>That they may walke in my statuta, and keepe my judicia, and do them, and they shall be my populus, and I will be their Deus.</p>
<p>But as for them whose cor walketh after the cor lapideum of their abominationes, I will retribuere their via upon their caput, saith the Domini Deus.</p>
