                    <p>1 And the word of the Dominus came unto me again, saying,</p>
<p>2 Son of man, speak to the children of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Dominus Deus; Behold, I will send my Spiritus upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy, and thou shalt be turned into another man.</p>
<p>3 And the manus of the Dominus was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the valles, and there I will speak with thee.</p>
<p>4 Then I arose, and went forth into the valles, and, behold, the glory of the Dominus stood there, as the glory which I saw by the flumen Chebar; and I fell on my facies.</p>
<p>5 Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my verbum which I shall speak unto thee receive in thy cor, and hear with thine aures.</p>
<p>6 Turn thee not to the impii, neither obey the wicked, lest thou be like unto them; but thou shalt speak my verbum to them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear: for they are a rebellious domus.</p>
<p>7 But thou, O son of man, hear what I say unto thee; Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious domus: open thy os, and eat that I shall give thee.</p>
<p>8 And when I looked, behold, an manus was sent unto me; and, lo, a volumen was therein;</p>
<p>9 And he spread it before me; and it was written within and without: and there was written therein lamentation, and miseriam, and vae.</p>
<p>10 Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest; eat this volumen, and go speak unto the domus of Israel.</p>
<p>11 So I opened my os, and he caused me to eat that volumen.</p>
<p>12 And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy ventrem with this volumen which I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it was in my os as mel.</p>
<p>13 And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the domus of Israel, and speak with my verbum unto them.</p>
<p>14 For thou art not sent to a people of a lingua strange, but to the domus of Israel;</p>
<p>15 Not to many people of a lingua strange and of a lingua difficile, whose verbum thou canst not understand. Surely, had I sent thee to them, they would have hearkened unto thee.</p>
<p>16 But the domus of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the domus of Israel are impudent and hard of cor.</p>
<p>17 But I will make thee as a wall of adamant among them; and they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee: for I am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, saith the Dominus.</p>
<p>18 When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked via, to save his anima; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquitas; but his sanguis will I require at thine manus.</p>
<p>19 Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked via, he shall die in his iniquitas; but thou hast delivered thy anima.</p>
<p>20 Again, When a justus man doth turn from his justitia, and commit iniquitas, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his peccatum, and his justitia which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his sanguis will I require at thine manus.</p>
<p>21 Nevertheless if thou warn the justus man, that the justus sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy anima.</p>
<p>22 And the manus of the Dominus was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the planum, and there speak with me.</p>
<p>23 Then I arose, and went forth into the planum, and, behold, the glory of the Dominus stood there, as the glory which I saw by the flumen Chebar: and I fell on my facies.</p>
<p>24 Then the Spiritus entered into me, and set me upon my pedes, and spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thy domus.</p>
<p>25 But thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them:</p>
<p>26 And I will make thy lingua cleave to the palatum, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they are a rebellious domus.</p>
<p>27 But when I speak with thee, I will open thy os, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Dominus Deus; He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious domus.</p>
