                    <p>And after five days Ananias the high sacerdos descended with the elders, and with a certain orator named Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul.</p>
<p>And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great tranquillitas, and that many reformationes are made by thy providentia,</p>
<p>We accept it always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clementia a breve temporis.</p>
<p>For we have found this man a pestis, and a mover of sedition among all the Iudaei throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:</p>
<p>Who also hath gone about to profane the templum: whom we took, and would have judged according to our lex,</p>
<p>And the tribunus Lysias came, and with great violence took him away out of our hands,</p>
<p>Commanding his accusers to come unto thee: by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him.</p>
<p>And the Iudaei also assented, saying that these things were so.</p>
<p>Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many anni a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself:</p>
<p>Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve dies since I went up to Hierosolyma for to adore.</p>
<p>And they neither found me in the templum disputing with any man, neither raising up the turbam, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:</p>
<p>Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me.</p>
<p>But this I confess unto thee, that after the via, which they call heresim, so worship I the Deus of my patres, believing all things which are written in the lex, and in the prophetis:</p>
<p>And have hope toward Deus, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrectio of the justi and unjusti.</p>
<p>And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscientia without reprehensio, toward Deus and toward men.</p>
<p>Now after many anni I came to bring almonas to my nation, and offerings,</p>
<p>Among which I was in the templum, serving according to the ritus, without tumultum, and without concursus.</p>
<p>Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me.</p>
<p>But this I confess unto thee, that after the via, which they call heresim, so worship I the Deus of my patres, believing all things which are written in the lex, and in the prophetis:</p>
<p>And have hope toward Deus, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrectio of the justi and unjusti.</p>
<p>And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscientia without reprehensio, toward Deus and toward men.</p>
<p>But this I say, that the causa which I have committed, is this, That I worshipped the Deus of my patres, believing all things which are written in the lex, and in the prophetis:</p>
<p>Having hope toward Deus, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrectio of the justi and unjusti, among whom I am also.</p>
<p>Herein I also exercise myself, to have always a conscientia without reprehensio, toward Deus and toward men.</p>
<p>And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promissio made of Deus, unto our patres:</p>
<p>Unto which promissio our twelve tribus, instantly serving Deus day and night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Iudaei.</p>
<p>Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that Deus should raise the mortui?</p>
<p>I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the nomine of Iesus of Nazareth.</p>
<p>Which thing I also did in Hierosolyma: and many of the sancti did I shut up in carceres, having received autoritas from the principes of the sacerdotes, and when they were put to death, I gave my sententia.</p>
<p>And I punished them oft in every synagoga, and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto strange civitates.</p>
<p>Whereupon as I went to Damascum with autoritas, and commission from the principes of the sacerdotes,</p>
<p>At midday, O king, I saw in the via a lumen from heaven, above the splendor of the sol, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me.</p>
<p>When we were all fallen to the terra, I heard a vox speaking unto me, and saying in the lingua Hebraea, Saul, Saul, quare me persequeris? it is hard for thee to kick against the stimulum.</p>
<p>And I said, Who art thou, Domine? And he said, I am Iesus whom thou persequeris.</p>
<p>But rise, and stand upon thy pedes: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and testem, both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee;</p>
<p>Delivering thee from the populus, and from the gentes, unto whom now I send thee,</p>
<p>To open their oculi, and to turn them from tenebris to lumen, and from the potestas of Satanas unto Deus, that they may receive remissio of peccata, and inheritance among them which are sanctificati by fide which is in me.</p>
<p>Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the caelestis visio:</p>
<p>But shewed first unto them of Damascum, and at Hierosolyma, and throughout all the region of Iudaea, and then to the gentes, that they should repent and turn to Deus, doing works meet for repentantia.</p>
<p>For these causes the Iudaei caught me in the templum, and went about to kill me.</p>
<p>Having therefore obtained help of Deus, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophetes and Moyses did say should come:</p>
<p>That Christus should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from the mortui, and should shew lumen unto the populus, and to the gentes.</p>
<p>And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud vox, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad.</p>
<p>But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of veritas, and soberness.</p>
<p>For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; seeing that this thing was not done in a corner.</p>
<p>King Agrippa, believest thou the prophetes? I know that thou believest.</p>
<p>Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.</p>
<p>And Paul said, I would to Deus that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these vincula.</p>
<p>And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them:</p>
<p>And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doth nothing worthy of death or of vincula.</p>
<p>Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at libertas, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.</p>
