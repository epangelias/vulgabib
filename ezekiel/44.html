                    <p>1 Then he brought me back the way of the gate of the outward sanctuarium, and it was shut.</p>
<p>2 Thus saith Dominus Deus; This gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because Dominus, the God of Israel, hath entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut.</p>
<p>3 It is for the prince; the prince, he shall sit in it to eat panem, and he shall enter by the via of the vestibulum of the gate, and shall go out by the way of the same.</p>
<p>4 Then brought he me the way of the north portam, before the domus, and I looked, and, behold, the gloria Domini filled the domus of the Lord: and I fell upon my face.</p>
<p>5 And the Lord said unto me, Son of homo, mark well, and behold with thine oculi, and hear with thine aures all that I say unto thee, and mark well the introitus of the domus, with every egressus out of the sanctuarium.</p>
<p>6 And thou shalt say to the rebellious, to the domus of Israel, Thus saith Dominus Deus; O domus of Israel, let us have an end, I pray you, of all your abominationes:</p>
<p>7 In that ye have brought into my sanctuarium extraneos, uncircumcised in corde, and uncircumcised in carne, to be in my sanctuarium, to pollute it, even my domus, when ye offer my panem, the adipem, and sanguinem, and they have broken my pactum with all your abominationes;</p>
<p>8 And ye have not kept the custodia of my sanctuarium, but ye have set custodes of my custodia for yourselves in my sanctuarium for your own voluntas.</p>
<p>9 Thus saith Dominus Deus; No extraneus, uncircumcised in corde, nor uncircumcised in carne, shall enter into my sanctuarium, of any extraneus that is among the filii of Israel.</p>
<p>10 And the Levites that are gone far from me, when Israel went astray, which went astray away from me after their idola; they shall even bear their iniquitatem.</p>
<p>11 And they shall be in my sanctuarium, custodes of the portae of the domus, and ministers of the domus: they shall slay the holocaustum and the victimam for the populus, and they shall stand before them to minister unto them.</p>
<p>12 Because they ministered unto them before their idola, and caused the domus of Israel to fall into iniquitatem; therefore have I lifted up mine manus against them, saith Dominus Deus, and they shall bear their iniquitatem:</p>
<p>13 And they shall not come near unto me, to do the sacerdotium unto me, nor to come nigh to any of my sanctuarium, unto the things that are sanctuarium to me: but they shall bear their ignominiam, and their abominationes which they have committed.</p>
<p>14 But I will make them custodes of the charge of the domus, for all the ministerium thereof, and for all that shall be done therein.</p>
<p>15 But the sacerdotes the Levites, the filii of Zadok, that kept the custodia of my sanctuarium when the filii of Israel went astray from me, they shall come near to me to minister unto me, and they shall stand before me to offer unto me the adipem and sanguinem, saith Dominus Deus:</p>
<p>16 They shall enter into my sanctuarium, and they shall come nigh to my mensa, to minister unto me, and they shall keep my custodia.</p>
<p>17 And it shall be they that shall enter into the atrium of the interior domus, they that are in the atrium of the domus, shall be clothed with linen vestibus, and no villus shall be upon them.</p>
<p>18 They shall have bonnets of linen upon their capitibus, and shall have linen breeches upon their lumbis; they shall not gird themselves with any thing that causeth sudorem.</p>
<p>19 And when they go forth into the atrium of the exterior domus, even into the atrium of the exterior domus to the populus, they shall put off their vestibus wherein they ministered, and lay them in the sanctuarium chambers, and they shall put on other vestibus; and they shall not sanctify the populus with their vestibus.</p>
<p>20 Neither shall they shave their caput, nor suffer their caput to grow long, but polling the caput of their capitibus.</p>
<p>21 Neither shall any sacerdos drink vinum when they enter into the interior atrium.</p>
<p>22 Neither shall they take for their uxores a viduam, nor her that is repudiata: but they shall take maidens of the semen of the domus of Israel, or a viduam that had a vir of the sacerdotes.</p>
<p>23 And they shall teach my populus the differentiam between sanctuarium and pollutum, and cause them to discern between pollutum and mundum.</p>
<p>24 And in controversy they shall stand in judgment; and they shall judge it according to my iudicia: and they shall keep my leges and my statuta in all my solennitates, and they shall hallow my sabbata.</p>
<p>25 And they shall come at no mortuum personam to pollute themselves: but for pater, or for mater, or for filius, or for filiam, for frater, or for soror a viro non maritata they may be polluted.</p>
<p>26 And after he is cleansed, they shall reckon unto him septem dies.</p>
<p>27 And in the die that he goeth into the sanctuarium, unto the interior atrium, to minister in the sanctuarium, he shall offer his peccatum, saith Dominus Deus.</p>
<p>28 And it shall be unto them for hereditas: I am their hereditas: and ye shall give them no possession in Israel: I am their possession.</p>
<p>29 They shall eat the sacrificium of the peccatum, and the sacrificium of the trespass, and every anathema in Israel shall be theirs.</p>
<p>30 And the primitiae of all the dona of all the oblationes of all the sanctuarium of the sanctuarium, and every oblatio of all the oblationes of yours, shall be the sacerdotum: ye shall also give unto the sacerdotium the primitias of your panis, to cause the benedictio to rest in thy domus.</p>
<p>31 The sacerdotes shall not eat of any thing that is mortuum, or torn, whether it be fowl or beast.</p>
<p>32 And the sacerdos that hath the macula of the mortuorum, or a vir of the semen of the sacerdotes, shall not be defiled for the regnum of the mortuorum among his populus;</p>
