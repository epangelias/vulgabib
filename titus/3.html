                    <p>Remind them to be subject to principes and potestates, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,</p>
<p>For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving various cupiditates and pleasures, living in malitia and envy, hateful, and hating one another.</p>
<p>But when the benignitas and amor of Deus our Saviour toward man appeared,</p>
<p>Not by works of justitia which we have done, but according to his misericordia he saved us, by the lavacrum regenerationis, and renovatio Spiritus Sancti;</p>
<p>Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;</p>
<p>That being justified by his gratia, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</p>
<p>This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in Deus might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.</p>
<p>But avoid foolish questions, and genealogias, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.</p>
<p>A man that is a haereticus after the first and second admonition reject;</p>
<p>Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself.</p>
<p>When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.</p>
<p>Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.</p>
<p>Our friends salute thee. Greet them that love us in fide. Gratia be with you all. Amen.</p>
