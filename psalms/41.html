                    <p>Blessed is he that considereth the pauper (poor), the Lord will deliver him in the time of tribulatio (tribulation).</p>
<p>The Lord will preserve him, and keep him alive; and he shall be blessed upon the terra (earth): and thou wilt not deliver him unto the voluntas (will) of his enemies.</p>
<p>The Lord will strengthen him upon the lectus (bed) of languor (sickness): thou wilt make all his lectus (bed) in his infirmitas (sickness).</p>
<p>I said, Lord, have misericordia (mercy) upon me: heal my animus (soul); for I have peccatum (sinned) against thee.</p>
<p>Mine inimici (enemies) speak malum (evil) against me, When shall he die, and his nomen (name) perish?</p>
<p>And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanitas (vanity): his cor (heart) gathereth iniquitas (iniquity) to himself; he goeth forth, and speaketh in it.</p>
<p>All that hate me whisper together against me: against me do they devise malum (evil).</p>
<p>An afflictio (affliction) cleaveth fast unto him: and now that he lieth he shall rise up no more.</p>
<p>Yea, mine own familiaris (familiar friend), in whom I trusted, which did eat my panis (bread), hath lifted up his calcaneus (heel) against me.</p>
<p>But thou, O Lord, have misericordia (mercy) upon me, and raise me up, that I may render them retributio (retribution).</p>
<p>By this I know that thou favoreth me, because mine inimicus (enemy) doth not triumph over me.</p>
<p>And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integritas (integrity), and settest me before thy facies (face) for ever.</p>
<p>Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from sempiternum (everlasting) to sempiternum (everlasting). Amen, and Amen.</p>
