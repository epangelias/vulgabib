                    <p>And it came to pass, after the mortis of Iosue, that the filii Israel asked the Dominus, saying, Qui shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to pugnare against them?</p>
<p>And the Dominus said, Iudah shall go up: behold, I have delivered the terra into his manus.</p>
<p>And Iudah said unto Simeon his frater, Come up with me into my sorte, that we may pugnare against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with thee into thy sorte: so Simeon went with him.</p>
<p>And Iudah went up; and the Dominus delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their manus: and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand homines.</p>
<p>And they found Adonibezek in Bezek: and they pugnaverunt against him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.</p>
<p>But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his pollices and his pedes.</p>
<p>And Adonibezek said, Threescore and ten reges, having their pollices and pedes cut off, gathered their cibum under my mensa: as I have done, so God hath requited me. And they brought him to Ierusalem, and there he mortuus est.</p>
<p>And the filii Iudah pugnaverunt against Ierusalem, and took it, and smote it with the oralis of the gladius, and set the civitas on ignem.</p>
<p>And afterwards the filii Iudah went down to pugnare against the Canaanites, that dwelt in the montibus, and in the Negev, and in the Shephelah.</p>
<p>And Iudah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron: (now the nomen of Hebron before was Kirjatharba:) and they slew Sesai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, the filii of Anak.</p>
<p>And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and the nomen of Debir before was Kirjathsepher:</p>
<p>And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my filiam as uxor.</p>
<p>And Othniel the filius of Kenaz, the frater of Caleb, took it: and he gave him Achsah his filiam as uxor.</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him to ask of her pater a ager: and she lighted off her asinus; and Caleb said unto her, What willeth thou?</p>
<p>Who answered, Give me a benedictio; for thou hast given me a terra seca; give me also fontes aquae. And Caleb gave her the fontes superiores and the fontes inferiores.</p>
<p>And the filii of the Kenite, Moses' socius, went up out of the civitas of the palm trees with the filii of Iudah into the wilderness of Iudah, which lieth in the Negev of Arad; and they went and dwelt among the populus.</p>
<p>And Iudah went with Simeon his frater, and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the nomen of the civitas was called Hormah.</p>
<p>Also Iudah took Gaza with the terminus of it, and Askelon with the terminus of it, and Ekron with the terminus of it.</p>
<p>And the Dominus was with Iudah; and he drave out the inhabitants of the montibus; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the vallis, because they had currus ferrati.</p>
<p>And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses said: and he expelled thence the tres filii of Anak.</p>
<p>And the filii of Benjamin did not drive out the Iebusites that inhabited Ierusalem; but the Iebusites dwelt with the filii of Benjamin in Ierusalem unto this dies.</p>
<p>And the domus of Ioseph went up to Bethel: and the Dominus was with them.</p>
<p>And the domus of Ioseph sent to descry Bethel. (Now the nomen of the civitas before was Luz.)</p>
<p>And the speculatores saw a vir going out of the civitas, and they said unto him, Shew us, we pray thee, the ingressum into the civitas, and we will shew thee misericordia.</p>
<p>And when he shewed them the ingressum into the civitas, they smote the civitas with the oralis of the gladius, but they let the vir and all his familia go.</p>
<p>And the vir went into the terra of the Hittites, and built a civitas, and called the nomen thereof Luz: which is the nomen thereof unto this dies.</p>
<p>Neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Bethshean and her filiae, nor Taanach and her filiae, nor the inhabitants of Dor and her filiae, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her filiae, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her filiae: but the Canaanites would dwell in that terra.</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the Canaanites to tributum, and did not utterly drive them out.</p>
<p>Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.</p>
<p>Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became tributarii.</p>
<p>Neither did Aser drive out the inhabitants of Accho, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob:</p>
<p>But the Aserites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the terra: for they did not drive them out.</p>
<p>Neither did Nephthali drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh, nor the inhabitants of Bethanath; but he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the terra: nevertheless the inhabitants of Bethshemesh and of Bethanath became tributarii unto them.</p>
<p>And the Amorites forced the filii of Dan into the montibus: for they would not suffer them to come down to the vallis:</p>
<p>But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the manus of the domus of Ioseph prevailed, so that they became tributarii.</p>
<p>And the terminus of the Amorites was from the ascending Adummim, which is on the Negev of the rivus: and the filii of Dan went up to pugnare against Leshem, and took it, and smote it with the oralis of the gladius, and possessed it, and dwelt therein, and called Leshem, Dan, after the nomen of Dan their pater.</p>
