                    <p>And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altaria, and prepare me here seven boves, and seven arietes.</p>
<p>Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered a bos upon every altare.</p>
<p>And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy holocaustum, and I will go: peradventure Dominus will occur before me: and whatsoever he sheweth me I will tell thee. And he went to an high place.</p>
<p>And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared seven altaria, and I have offered upon every altare a bos and an aries.</p>
<p>And the Lord put a word in Balaam's os, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak.</p>
<p>And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his holocaustum, he, and all the princes of Moab.</p>
<p>And he took up his parabola, and said, Balak the king of Moab hath brought me from Aram, out of the montes of the east, saying, Come, curse me Jacob, and come, defy Israel.</p>
<p>How shall I maledicere, whom God hath not maledictus? or how shall I defy, whom the Lord hath not defied?</p>
<p>For from the summitate of the rocks I see him, and from the collis I behold him: lo, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the gentes.</p>
<p>Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the numerus of the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the morte of the recti, and let my novissimus be like his!</p>
<p>And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me? I took thee to curse mine inimici, and, behold, thou hast blessed them altogether.</p>
<p>And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which the Lord hath put in my os?</p>
<p>And Balak said unto him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto another locus, from whence thou mayest see them: thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all: and curse me them from thence.</p>
<p>And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altaria, and offered a bos and an aries on every altare.</p>
<p>And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy holocaustum, while I meet the Lord yonder.</p>
<p>And the Lord met Balaam, and put a word in his os, and said, Go again unto Balak, and say thus.</p>
<p>And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his holocaustum, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him, What hath the Lord spoken?</p>
<p>And he took up his parabola, and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear; hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor:</p>
<p>God is not homo, that he should mentiri; neither the son of homo, that he should be changed: hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?</p>
<p>Behold, I have received commandment to bless: and he hath blessed; and I cannot call it back.</p>
<p>He hath not beheld iniquitatem in Jacob, neither hath he seen malum in Israel: the Lord his God is with him, and the clamor of a king is among them.</p>
<p>God brought them out of Aegypt; he hath as the unicornis his virtus.</p>
<p>Surely there is no veneficium in Jacob, neither is there any divinatio in Israel: according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought!</p>
<p>Behold, the people shall rise up as a leo, and lift up himself as a unicornis: and none shall be able to stand before him, until he have devoured the inimici, and broken the ossa of his hostes.</p>
<p>And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.</p>
<p>But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee, saying, All that the Lord speaketh, that I must do?</p>
<p>And Balak said unto Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring thee unto another locus; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them from thence.</p>
<p>And Balak brought Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh toward Jeshimon.</p>
<p>And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altaria, and prepare me here seven boves and seven arietes.</p>
<p>Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bos and an aries on every altare.</p>
