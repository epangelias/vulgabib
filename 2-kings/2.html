                    <p>1 And it came to pass, when the Lord would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.</p>
<p>2 And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the Lord hath sent me to Bethel. And Elisha said, As the Lord liveth, and as thy animus, I will not leave thee. So they went down to Bethel.</p>
<p>3 And the sons of the prophetae that were at Bethel came forth to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Lord will take away thy dominus to day? And he said, Yea, I know it; hold your os.</p>
<p>4 And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the Lord hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, As the Lord liveth, and as thy animus, I will not leave thee. So they came to Jericho.</p>
<p>5 And the sons of the prophetae that were at Jericho came to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Lord will take away thy dominus to day? And he said, Yea, I know it; hold your os.</p>
<p>6 And Elijah said unto him, Tarry, I pray thee, here; for the Lord hath sent me to Jordan. And he said, As the Lord liveth, and as thy animus, I will not leave thee. And they two went on.</p>
<p>7 And fifty men of the sons of the prophetae went, and stood to view afar off: and they two stood by Jordan.</p>
<p>8 And Elijah took his pallium, and wrapped it together, and smote the waters, and they were dividit on this side and on that side, so that they two went over on dry ground.</p>
<p>9 And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portio of thy spirit be upon me.</p>
<p>10 And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be so.</p>
<p>11 And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of ignis, and equi of ignis, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.</p>
<p>12 And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My pater, my pater, the currus of Israel, and the equites thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own vestes, and rent them in two pieces.</p>
<p>13 He took up also the pallium of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan;</p>
<p>14 And he took the pallium of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is the Deus of Elijah, even he that took Elijah up to heaven? but there was no vox, no answer.</p>
<p>15 And when the sons of the prophetae who were to view at Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the terra before him.</p>
<p>16 And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servus fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy dominus: lest peradventure the Spirit of the Lord hath taken him up, and cast him upon some montes, or into some vallis. And he said, Ye shall not send.</p>
<p>17 And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three dies, but found him not.</p>
<p>18 And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?</p>
<p>19 And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, I pray thee, the situs of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the aqua is naught, and the terra is sterilis.</p>
<p>20 And he said, Bring me a new cratere, and put sal in it. And they brought it to him.</p>
<p>21 And he went forth unto the fons of the aqua, and cast the sal in there, and said, Thus saith the Lord, I have healed these aquae; there shall not be from thence any more mortiferum, or terra sterilis.</p>
<p>22 So the aquae were healed unto this day, according to the word of Elisha which he spake.</p>
<p>23 And he went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little pueri out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou calvus: go up, thou calvus.</p>
<p>24 And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the nomine of the Lord. And there came forth two ursae out of the silva, and tare forty and two pueri of them.</p>
<p>25 And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria.</p>
