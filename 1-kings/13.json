  "And, behold, there came a man of Deus from Judah by the word of Dominus unto Bethel: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense.",
  "And he cried against the altar in the word of Dominus, and said, O altar, altar, thus saith Dominus; Behold, a filius shall be born unto the house of David, Josias by name; and upon thee shall he offer the sacrificii of the high places, and the sacerdotes that burn incense upon thee, and men's ossa shall they burn upon thee.",
  "And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which Dominus hath spoken; Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out.",
  "And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the homo of Deus, which had cried against the altar in Bethel, that he put forth his manus from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his manus, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not pull it in again to him.",
  "The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the homo of Deus had given by the word of Dominus.",
  "And the king answered and said unto the homo of Deus, Intreat now the facies of Dominus thy Deus, and pray for me, that my manus may be restored me again. And the homo of Deus besought the Dominus, and the king's manus was restored him again, and became as it was before.",
  "And the king said unto the homo of Deus, Come home with me, and refresh thyself, and I will give thee a donum.",
  "But the homo of Deus said unto the king, If thou wilt give me half thine house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat panem nor drink aqua in this loco:",
  "For so was it charged me by the word of Dominus, saying, Eat no panem, nor drink aqua, nor turn again by the same via that thou camest.",
  "So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came to Bethel.",
  "Now there dwelt an old propheta in Bethel; and his filius came and told him all the works that the homo of Deus had done that day in Bethel: the words which he had spoken unto the king, them they told also to their pater.",
  "And their pater said unto them, What via went he? For his filii had seen what via the homo of Deus went, which came from Judah.",
  "And he said unto his filii, Saddle me the asinus. So they saddled him the asinus: and he rode thereon,"
