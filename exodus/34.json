  "And the LORD said unto Moses, 'Hew for thyself two tablets of lapides, like unto the first: and I will write upon these tablets the verba, which were in the first tablets, which thou brake in pieces.",
  "And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto Mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me in the cima of the mount.",
  "And no man shall ascend with thee, neither let any man be seen throughout all the mons; neither let the oves nor the boves feed before that mount.",
  "And he hewed two tablets of lapides like unto the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto Mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and took in his manus the two tablets of lapides.",
  "And the LORD descended in the nubes, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the nomen of the LORD.",
  "And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, 'The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in clementia and veritas,'",
  "Keeping clementia for thousand generations, forgiving iniquitas and transgressio, and peccatum, and that will by no means clear the reus, visiting the iniquitas of the patres upon the filii, and upon the nepotes of them that hate me.",
  "And Moses made haste, and bowed his caput toward terra, and worshipped, and said, 'If now I have found gratia in thy sight, O Domine, let my Domine, I pray thee, go among us; for it is a populus stiffnecked; and pardon our iniquitas and our peccatum, and take us for thy hereditas.'",
  "And he said, 'Behold, I make a foedus: before all thy populus I will do marvels, such as have not been done in all the terra, nor in any gens: and all the populus among which thou art shall see the opus of the LORD: for it is a terribilis thing that I will do with thee.'",
  "Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I drive out before thee the Amorrhites, and the Chananaeans, and the Hethites, and the Pherezites, and the Hevites, and the Jebusites.",
  "Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a foedus with the inhabitants of the terra whither thou goest, lest it be for a scandalum to thee.",
  "But ye shall destroy their altaria, ye shall break their statues, and ye shall cut down their luci.",
  "For thou shalt worship no other deus: for the LORD, whose nomen is Zelus, is a zelous Deus:",
  "Lest thou make a foedus with the inhabitants of the terra, and they go a fornicari with their dii, and do sacrifice unto their dii, and one call thee, and thou eat of his sacrificium;",
  "And thou take of their filiae unto thy filii, and their filiae go a fornicari after their dii, and make thy filii go a fornicari after their dii.",
  "Thou shalt make thee no dii fundentes.",
  "The dies of the Azymes thou shalt keep. Seven dies thou shalt eat azymes, as I commanded thee, in the time appointed of the mensem of the new fruges; for in the mensem of the new fruges thou camest out from Aegyptus.",
  "All that openeth the vulva shall be the LORD's, and every primogenitum among thy pecudes, whether ox or sheep, shall be the LORD's.",
  "The primogenitum of an as thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and if thou wilt not redeem him, then thou shalt break his cervix. All the primogeniti of thy filii thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before me vacantem.",
  "Six dies thou shalt labor, and on the seventh dies thou shalt rest: in the time of sementis and in the time of messionis thou shalt rest.",
  "And thou shalt observe the dies of the hebdomada of the Azymes, and the dies of the collecta of the primitias of thy labor, and the dies of the collecta of the finis of thy labor.",
  "Thrice in the anno all thy males shall appear before the Domine Deus of Israel.",
  "For I will cast out the gentes before thee, and enlarge thy terminos: neither shall any man desire thy terra, when thou goest up to appear before the facies of the LORD thy Deus thrice in the anno.",
  "Thou shalt not offer the sanguis of my sacrificium upon leavened panis: neither shall the adipem of my sacrifice remain all nocte until mane.",
  "The primitias of the firstfruges of thy terra thou shalt bring unto the domus of the LORD thy Deus. Thou shalt not cook a kid in the lacte of his mater.'",
  "And the LORD said unto Moses, 'Write thou these verba: for after the tenor of these verba I have made a foedus with thee and with Israel.'",
  "And he was there with the LORD quadraginta dies and quadraginta noctes, he did neither eat panis, nor drink aqua. And he wrote upon the tablets the verba of the foedus, the decem verba.",
  "And it came to pass, when Moses came down from the montes of Sinai with the two tablets of the testimonium in Moses' manus, that Moses wist not that the pellem of his facies shone while he talked with him.",
  "And when Aaron and all the filii of Israel saw Moses, behold, the pellem of his facies shone; and they feared to come nigh him.",
  "And Moses called them; and Aaron and all the principes of the congregatio returned unto him: and Moses spake unto them.",
  "And afterward all the filii of Israel came nigh: and he gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him in the montes of Sinai.",
  "And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a velamen upon his facies.",
  "But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he took the velamen off until he came out. And he came out, and spake unto the filii of Israel that which he was commanded.",
  "And the filii of Israel saw the facies of Moses, that the pellem of Moses' facies shone: and Moses put the velamen upon his facies again, until he went in to speak with him."
