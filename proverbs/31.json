  "Who can find a virtuous mulier, for her pretium is far above pearls?",
  "The heart of her maritus doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no lack of lucrum.",
  "She will do him bonum and not malum all the dies of her vita.",
  "She seeketh lanificium and operatur willingly with her manus.",
  "She is like the navis of a mercator, that bringeth her panis from afarre.",
  "She riseth also while it is yet noctis, and giveth cibum to her domus, and a praecipium to her puellae.",
  "She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fructus of her manus she planteth a vinea.",
  "She girdeth her lumbus with fortitudo, and strengtheneth her bracchium.",
  "She perceiveth that her negotium is bonum: her lucerna shall not be extinguished nocte.",
  "She stretcheth out her manus to the pauper, yea, she reacheth forth her manus to the egenus.",
  "She shall not fear the gelu for her domus: for all her domus is vestita with dupplicia.",
  "She maketh herself vestes, and is vestita in byssus and purpura.",
  "Her maritus is known in the porta, when he sitteth among the senatores of the terra.",
  "She maketh a pallium, and selleth it, and delivereth a zona to the Chananitica.",
  "Fortitudo and honor are her vestis, and in the diem futurum she shall rejoice.",
  "She openeth her os with sapientia, and in lingua sua is lex gratiae.",
  "She looketh well to the via of her domus, and eateth not panis otiosus.",
  "Her filii rise up, and call her beata; her maritus also, and he praiseth her.",
  "Multae filiae have done virtuosum, but thou surpassest them all.",
  "Favor and pulchritudo are vana: but a mulier that timet Deum, she shall be praised.",
  "Give her of the fructus of her manus, and let her operae praise her in the porta."
