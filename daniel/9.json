  "1 In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, which was made rex over the realm of the Chaldeans;",
  "2 In the first year of his regnum I Daniel understood by libros the number of the years, whereof the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolation of Jerusalem.",
  "3 And I set my face unto Dominus Deus, to seek by oration and supplications, with ieiunium, sackcloth, and ashes:",
  "4 And I prayed unto Dominus Deus, and made my confessio, saying, O Dominus Deus, great and terribilis, keeping the foedus and mercy to them that love thee, and to them that keep thy mandata;",
  "5 We have sinned, and have committed iniquitatem, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts and from thy iudicia:",
  "6 Neither have we hearkened unto thy servientes the prophets, which spake in thy name to our reges, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.",
  "7 O Dominus Deus, to thee belong mercifulness and iustitia, but to us confusion of facies, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that are near, and that are far off, through all the terrae, whither thou hast driven them, because of their transgression that they have trespassed against thee.",
  "8 O Dominus, to us belongeth confusion of facies, to our reges, to our princes, and to our patres, because we have sinned against thee.",
  "9 To Dominus Deus our Deus pertaineth mercifulness and forgiveness, though we have rebelled against him;",
  "10 Neither have we obeyed the voice of Dominus Deus, to walk in his leges, which he set before us by the hand of his servientes the prophets.",
  "11 Yea, all Israel have trangressed thy lex, even by departing, that they might not obey thy voice; therefore the maledictio is poured upon us, and the oath that is written in the lex of Moses the servus of Deus, because we have sinned against him.",
  "12 And he hath confirmed his words, which he spake against us, and against our iudices that iudged us, by bringing upon us a great malum, such as never was under the caelum, as it is come to pass in Jerusalem.",
  "13 As it is written in the lex of Moses, all this malum is come upon us: yet made we not our oration before Dominus Deus, that we might turn from our iniquitates, and understand in thy veritas.",
  "14 Therefore hath Dominus Deus watched upon the malum, and brought it upon us: for Dominus Deus our Deus is iustus in all his opera which he doeth: for we obeyed not his voice.",
  "15 And now, O Dominus Deus, hearken to the oration of thy servus, and to his supplications, and cause thy facies to shine upon thy sanctuarium that is desolate, for Dominus Deus:",
  "16 O my Deus, incline thine aurem, and hear; open thine oculus, and behold our desolation, and the city which is called by thy name: for we do not present our supplications before thee for our iustitiae, but for thy multa misericordia.",
  "17 O Dominus, hear; O Dominus, forgive; O Dominus, hearken and do; defer not for thine own sake, O my Deus: for thy name's sake, because thy name is called upon thy city and thy people.",
  "18 When I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my peccata, and the peccata of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before Dominus Deus for the holy montem of my Deus;",
  "19 Yea, whiles I was speaking in oration, even the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the visio at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the oblation of the evening.",
  "20 And he informed me, and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I am now come forth to give thee sapientia and understanding.",
  "21 At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth, and I am come to shew thee; for thou art greatly beloved: therefore understand the matter, and consider the visio.",
  "22 Seventy hebdomades are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of peccata, and to make reconciliatio for iniquitatem, and to bring in aeternal iustitia, and to seal up the visio and prophecy, and to anoint the Sanctus of Sancti.",
  "23 Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven hebdomades, and threescore and two hebdomades: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times.",
  "24 And after threescore and two hebdomades shall the Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuarium; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined.",
  "25 And he shall confirm the foedus with many for one hebdomad: and in the midst of the hebdomad he shall cause the sacrificium and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of the abdominum of desolation he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate.",
  "26 And the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuarium; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined.",
  "27 And he shall confirm the foedus with many for one hebdomad: and in the midst of the hebdomad he shall cause the sacrificium and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of the abdominum of desolation he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate."
