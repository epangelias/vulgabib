                    <p>Love righteousness, ye that be judges of the earth: think of the Lord with a good heart, and in simplicity of heart seek Him.</p>
<p>For He made us, and when He saw our adoration, He chose us.</p>
<p>For in wisdom must all things be governed: and prudential judgment understandeth justice, and is always before her.</p>
<p>She hath given to holy souls excellent wisdom, and hath seen the righteous and hath loved them.</p>
<p>She is more beautiful than the sun, and above all the order of stars: compared to the light, she is found beforehand.</p>
<p>For after this cometh night: but vice shall be destroyed at the light, and the wickedness of ignorance, when that is come which is sensible.</p>
<p>For the unwise were persuaded by the subtleties of the wicked, and were deceived.</p>
<p>For they have not known the ways of the Lord, nor the things that of Him: neither have they understood the distribution of gifts, nor the glory of His name.</p>
<p>Give ear, ye that be unwise, and ye that are foolish, and ye that are unlearned, and covet wisdom, and instruct your souls.</p>
<p>For the mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue talketh of judgment.</p>
