                    <p>Thus saith the Dominus unto me; Behold, I will give Pharaoh Hophra rex Aegypti into the manus of his enemies, and into the manus of them that seek his vita.</p>
<p>Then it shall be, when thou hast finished legere this libro, thou shalt bind a petra to it, and cast it into the middle of Euphrates:</p>
<p>Thus saith the Dominus; Behold, that which I have built will I destroy, and that which I have planted I will pluck up, even this whole terra.</p>
<p>And seekest thou magnificare veritatem, or to appareo in exterioribus; for they have not hearkened unto verbum Domini, nor received correction.</p>
<p>And it shall be, when they shall say unto thee, Wherefore doth the Dominus speak thus against this terra? what wickedness is this, that our patres have committed?</p>
<p>Tell them, Because your patres have reliquished the Domini, and served other dii, and worshipped them, and served them; therefore hath the Dominus reliquished you.</p>
