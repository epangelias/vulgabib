                    <p>And the Lord called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying, 'Hic est sermo quem loqueris ad filios Israel: offerant mihi victimam, quae sit ignis holocausti' (Offer unto me an offering made by fire, a holocaust).</p>
<p>Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, 'Ecce lex victime holocausti' (Behold, this is the law of the burnt offering).</p>
<p>It is a holocaust, quia in igne holocausti tota nocte usque mane' (for it is a holocaust, because in the fire of the holocaust it shall be burnt all night unto the morning).</p>
<p>And the priest shall put on his vestimenta lineas (linen garments), and the caligae lineae (linen breeches) shall he put upon his flesh, and take up the ashes which the ignis (fire) hath consumed with the holocaust on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar.</p>
<p>And he shall put off his vestimenta (garments), and put on other vestes (garments), and carry forth the cineres (ashes) without the castrum (camp) unto a locus mundus (clean place).</p>
<p>And the ignis (fire) upon the altar shall be burning in it, it shall not be extinguished: and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and lay the holocaust in order upon it; and he shall burn thereon the adipem (fat) of the pacification.</p>
<p>This is a perpetual holocaust, quae semper ardebit a generatione in generationem (which shall always burn from generation to generation) in ostio tabernaculi testimonii coram Domino (before the door of the tabernacle of the testimony before the Lord).</p>
<p>And thou shalt offer upon it the holocaust of the morning, and the holocaust of the evening (vespertina).</p>
<p>According to the ritus (rite) of the holocaust of the evening (vespertina), thou shalt offer it, a sweet odorem (savour) for the Lord.</p>
<p>And on the sabbatum (sabbath day) two agni immaculati (lambs without blemish), of the first year, and two decimas (two tenth deals) of simila (fine flour) for sacrifice, which shall be mingled with oleo (oil), and oblatio (oblation),</p>
