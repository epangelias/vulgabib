  "1 Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest, all the days of the vita of thy vanity, which he hath given thee under the sol. For that is thy portion in this vita, and in thy labour which thou takest under the sol.",
  "2 Live, and eat thy panem with joy, and drink thy vinum with a merry heart; for God now accepteth thy works.",
  "3 Give portions to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest not what malum shall be upon the terra.",
  "4 Whoever observeth the ventus shall not sow; and whoever regardeth the nubes shall not reap.",
  "5 As thou knowest not what is the via of the spirit, nor how the ossa do grow in the womb of her that is gravida: even so thou knowest not the opera of God who maketh all.",
  "6 In the morning sow thy semen, and in the vespere withhold not thy manum: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether they both shall be equally good.",
  "7 Truly the lumen is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the oculi to behold the sol:",
  "8 But if a homo live many annos, and rejoice in them all; yet let him remember the dies of tenebrae; for they shall be many. All that cometh is vanitas.",
  "9 Live joyfully, O young homo, and let thy cor have its desiderium in the dies of thy iuventus, and walk in the via of thy cor, and in the sight of thy oculi: but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into iudicium.",
  "10 Therefore remove sorrow from thy cor, and put away malum from thy caro: for childhood and iuventus are vanitas.",
  "11 Wisdom is good with an hereditas: and they that vide the sol, shall have it.",
  "12 For wisdom is a defence, and moneta is a defence: but the utilitas of knowledge is, that wisdom preserveth the possessorem of it.",
  "13 Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as the lumen excelleth tenebrae.",
  "14 The sapiens man's oculi are in his caput; but the stultus man walketh in tenebrae: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all.",
  "15 Then said I in my cor, As is the event of the stultus, so it falleth out to me; and why was I then more sapiens? Then I said in my cor, that this is also vanitas.",
  "16 For there is no memoria of the sapiens more than of the stultus for ever; seeing that which now is in the dies to come shall all be oblivioni.",
  "17 Therefore I hated vita; because the opera that is wrought under the sol is grievous unto me: for all is vanitas and vexatio spiritus.",
  "18 Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sol: because I should leave it unto the homo that shall be after me.",
  "19 And who knoweth whether he shall be sapiens or stultus? yet shall he have dominion over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shewed myself sapiens under the sol. This is also vanitas.",
  "20 Therefore I went away, and repented myself concerning all the labour which I had taken under the sol.",
  "21 For there is a homo whose labour is in sapienia, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a homo that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it for his portio. This also is vanitas and a great malum.",
  "22 For what hath homo of all his labour, and of the vexatio of his cor, wherein he hath laboured under the sol?",
  "23 For all his dies are dolor, and his travail vexatio: yea, his cor is not in rest in nocte. This is also vanitas.",
  "24 There is nothing better for a homo, than that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his anima see bonum in his labour. This also I saw, that it was from the manus of God.",
  "25 For who can eat, or who else can hasten hereunto more than I?",
  "26 For God giveth to a homo that is good in his sight, wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the peccator he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good before God. This also is vanitas and vexatio spiritus.",
  "28 And this have I seen, that it is from the manus of God.",
  "29 For who knoweth what is bonum for a homo in this vita, all the dies of his vita, seeing the dies of his vita are but umbrae; for who can tell a homo what shall be after him under the sol?"
