                    <p>Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubim there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the throne, similis imaginum throni.</p>
<p>And he spake unto the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in between the wheels, even under the cherub, and fill thine hand with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city. Et ingressus est in medio rotarum sub cherubim.</p>
<p>And he went in in my sight, now the cloud had filled the inner court. Et nubes implevit atrium interius.</p>
<p>And the glory of the Lord was lifted up from the cherub, and went to the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the Lord's glory. Et gloria Domini elevata est a cherubin ad limen domus, et impleta est domus nube, et atrium repletum est lumine gloriae Domini.</p>
<p>And the sound of the cherubim's wings was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaketh. Et auditus est sonus alarum cherubim usque ad atrium exterius, quasi vox Dei Omnipotentis cum loquitur.</p>
<p>And it came to pass, that when he had commanded the man clothed with linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels, from between the cherubim; then he went in, and stood beside the wheels. Et factum est, cum praecepisset viro, qui induebatur lineis, dicens, Tolle ignem inter rotas, inter cherubim, ingressus est, et stetit juxta rotas.</p>
<p>And one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubim unto the fire that was between the cherubim, and took thereof, and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen: who took it, and went out. Et extendit cherub unus manum suam inter cherubim ad ignem, qui erat inter cherubim, et sustulit, et posuit in manus ejus, qui induebatur lineis, qui accepit, et egressus est.</p>
<p>And there appeared in the cherubim the form of a man's hand under their wings. Et apparuit in cherubin similitudo manus hominis sub alis eorum.</p>
<p>And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubim, one wheel by one cherub, and another wheel by another cherub: and the appearance of the wheels was as the colour of a beryl stone. Et vidi, et ecce quattuor rotæ iuxta cherubim, rota una juxta cherub unum, et rota altera juxta cherub alterum, et species rotarum quasi aspectus lapidis berilli.</p>
<p>And as for their appearances, they four had one likeness, as if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel. Et aspectus earum, quatuor habebant similitudinem unius, quasi si esset in medio rotæ rota.</p>
<p>When they went, they went upon their four sides: and they turned not when they went; but to the place whither the head looked they followed it; they turned not as they went. Cum procederent, in quattuor partibus procedebant, et non convertebantur cum ambularent, sed ad locum, versus quem faciebant capita, sequebantur, et non convertebantur cum ambularent.</p>
<p>And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about, even the wheels that they four had. Et totum corpus earum, et dorsum, et manus, et alæ, et rotæ, plena erant oculis in gyro, et in quattuor rotis earum.</p>
<p>As for the wheels, it was cried unto them in my hearing, O wheel. Ad rotas enim vocem factam est in auribus meis, O rota.</p>
<p>And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of a cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle. Et quatuor facies habebat unumquodque, facies prima facies cherub, et secunda facies hominis, et tertia facies leonis, et quarta facies aquilæ.</p>
<p>And the cherubim were lifted up. This is the living creature that I saw by the river of Chebar. Et elevati sunt cherubim, hic est animal vivens, quod vidi juxta fluvium Chobar.</p>
<p>And when the cherubim went, the wheels went by them: and when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the same wheels also turned not from beside them. Cum procederent cherubim, procedebant simul et rotæ, et cum elevarent cherubim alas suas, ut ascendentes levarentur a terra, non convertebantur rotæ cum ipsis.</p>
<p>When they stood, these stood; and when they were lifted up, these lifted up themselves also: for the spirit of the living creature was in them. Cum starent, stabant, et cum elevarentur, elevabant se simul, quia spiritus animalis vivi erat in eis.</p>
<p>Then the glory of the Lord departed from off the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubim. Et egressa est gloria Domini a limine domus, et stetit super cherubin.</p>
<p>And the cherubim lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight: when they went out, the wheels also were beside them, and every one stood at the door of the east gate of the Lord's house; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above. Et levaverunt cherubim alas suas, et ascenderunt de terra in conspectu meo, cum egrederentur, rotæ quoque erant juxta ea, et stetit unusquisque in ostio portæ domus Domini orientalis, et gloria Dei Israël erat super ea desuper.</p>
<p>This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river of Chebar; and I knew that they were the cherubim. Hoc est animal vivens, quod vidi sub Deo Israël juxta fluvium Chobar, et cognovi quod cherubin essent.</p>
<p>Every one had four wings; and every one had four faces: the likeness of a man was in them. Quatuor alas habebat unusquisque, et quatuor facies habebant, similitudo autem hominis in eis erat.</p>
<p>And their faces and their wings were the same as those whom I saw by the river of Chebar. Et facies earum, et alæ earum, sicut quas videram juxta fluvium Chobar.</p>
<p>They went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; and they turned not when they went. Incedebant unusquisque ante faciem suam, quo ibat spiritus, ibant, et non convertebantur cum ambularent.</p>
<p>And the glory of the Lord went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain that is on the east side of the city. Et ascensa est gloria Domini de medio civitatis, et stetit super montem, qui erat ab oriente civitatis.</p>
