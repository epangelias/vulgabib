                    <p>1 They that trust in the Dominus shall be as mount Zion, which cannot be removed, but abideth for ever.</p>
<p>2 As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the Dominus is round about his people from henceforth even for ever.</p>
<p>3 For the sceptre of wickedness shall not rest upon the lot of the just, lest the just put forth their manus to iniquity.</p>
<p>4 Do good, O Dominus, unto those that be boni, and to them that be recti in their cor.</p>
<p>5 But those that declinaverunt unto their via pravam, the Dominus shall lead them forth with the operarii of iniquity: pax super Israel.</p>
