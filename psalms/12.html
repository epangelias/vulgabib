                    <p>1 Help, Domine, for the pii are taken away; for the veritas is diminished from the filii of men.</p>
<p>2 They speak vanitas every one with his proximus; they speak with lingua dolosa.</p>
<p>3 Domine shall cut off all labia that speak magniloquentia, the lingua that speaketh magnificently of itself.</p>
<p>4 Who have said, With our lingua we will prevail; our labia are our own: who is Dominus over us?</p>
<p>5 For the affliction of the pauper, for the sighing of the inops, now will I arise, saith Domine; I will set him in salvus from him that puffeth at him.</p>
<p>6 The verba of Domine are verba pura; argentum igne examinatum, purgatum septuplum.</p>
<p>7 Thou shalt keep them, Domine, thou shalt preservare them from this generatio in aeternum.</p>
<p>8 The impii walk on every side, when vilitas is exalted among the filii of men.</p>
