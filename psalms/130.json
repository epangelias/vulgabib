  "De profundis clamavi ad te Domine, Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O Lord.",
  "Domine, audi vocem meam, be attentive to my voice, and let thine ears be obedient to the voice of my supplications.",
  "Si iniquitates observaveris Domine, qui potest sustinere ita, If thou, Lord, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?",
  "Quia apud te propitiatio est ut timeamus te, But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared.",
  "Sustinui te Domine, in toto corde meo, I wait for the Lord, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope.",
  "Sustinui, ut sustinet spes, in salutari tuo, My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning.",
  "Expectat Israel in Domino, quia apud Dominum misericordia, et copiosa apud eum redemptio, Let Israel hope in the Lord: for with the Lord there is mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption:",
  "Et ipse redimet Israel ex omnibus iniquitatibus eius, And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities."
