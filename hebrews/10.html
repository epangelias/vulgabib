                    <p>By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrificium than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.</p>
<p>By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see mortem; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimonium, that he pleased Deus.</p>
<p>By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the iustitia which is by fides.</p>
<p>But without faith it is impossible to please Deus: for he that cometh to Deus must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.</p>
<p>For the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets:</p>
<p>Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought iustitia, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,</p>
<p>Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.</p>
<p>Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:</p>
<p>And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:</p>
<p>They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;</p>
<p>(Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.</p>
<p>And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:</p>
<p>God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.</p>
