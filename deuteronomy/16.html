                    <p>1 Observe the mensis of the new moon, to offer sacrificium before the Lord thy God: for in this mensis the Lord thy Deus led thee out of Aegyptum by noctis.</p>
<p>2 Thou shalt therefore offer sacrificium to the Lord thy Deus, of the armentum and of the flock, in the locum which the Lord shall choose to place his Nomen there.</p>
<p>3 Thou shalt eat no panis with it; septem dies shalt thou eat unleavened panis therewith, even panis of affliction: for thou camest forth out of Aegyptum in haste.</p>
<p>4 And there shall be no fermentum seen with thee in all thy terminus, seven dies, neither shall ought of the caro, which thou sacrificedst the first dies at vespere, remain all noctis until mane.</p>
<p>5 Thou mayest not offer sacrificium within omnis one of thy portae, which the Lord thy Deus giveth thee:</p>
<p>6 But in the locum which the Lord thy Deus shall choose to place his Nomen in, there thou shalt offer sacrificium at vespera, at the going down of sol.</p>
<p>7 And thou shalt turn it into ignis, and eat it in the locum which the Lord thy Deus shall choose: and thou shalt turneare in the mane.</p>
<p>8 Six dies thou shalt eat unleavened panis: and in the septimus dies shall be a solemnis congregatio to the Lord thy Deus: thou shalt do no opus servilis.</p>
<p>9 Septem septimanas shalt thou numbere unto thee: begin to numbere the septimanas from the dies that thou beginnest to put the sickle to the seges.</p>
<p>10 And thou shalt keep the festum of septimanas unto the Lord thy Deus with a spontaneus munus of thine manus, which thou shalt give according as the Lord thy Deus hath blessed thee:</p>
<p>11 And thou shalt rejoyce before the Lord thy Deus, thou, and thy filius, and thy filia, and thy servus, and thy ancilla, and the Levites, and the peregrinus, and the pupillus, and the vidua, that are within thy portae.</p>
<p>12 And thou shalt remember that thou wast a servus in Aegyptum: and thou shalt observe and do these statuta.</p>
<p>13 Thou shalt observe the festum of Tabernaculorum septem dies, after that thou hast gathered in from thy area, and from thy torcular.</p>
<p>14 And thou shalt rejoyce in thy festum, thou, and thy filius, and thy filia, and thy servus, and thy ancilla, and the Levites, and the peregrinus, and the pupillus, and the vidua, that are within thy portae.</p>
<p>15 Septem dies shalt thou keep a solemnis festum to the Lord thy Deus in the locum which the Lord shall choose: and the Lord thy Deus shall bless thee in all thy fruges, and in all the opus of thine manos, and thou shalt be altogether iucundus.</p>
<p>16 Three times in the anno shalt all thy males appareo before the Lord thy Deus in the locum which he shall choose; in the festum of the azymes, and in the festum of septimanas, and in the festum of Tabernaculorum: and they shall not appareo before the Lord vacantem.</p>
<p>17 Every homo shall give according to the datum of his manus, according as the Lord thy Deus hath blessed thee.</p>
<p>18 Iudices and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy portae, which the Lord thy Deus giveth thee, throughout thy tribes: and they shall iudicare the populus with iustus iudicium.</p>
<p>19 Thou shalt not pervertare iudicium; thou shalt not respectare personas, neither shalt thou take amicum: for a munus doth blind the eyes of the sapientes, and pervertare the words of the iusti.</p>
<p>20 Iustitiam, iustitiam shalt thou follow, that thou mayest live, and inherere the terra which the Lord thy Deus giveth thee.</p>
<p>21 Thou shalt not plantare a grove of any lignum near unto the altar of the Lord thy Deus, which thou shalt make.</p>
<p>22 Neither shalt thou set up any titulus: which the Lord thy Deus hateth.</p>
<p>23 Thou shalt not immolare unto the Lord thy Deus an ox, or a sheep, wherein is blemish, or ought vitiosum: for that is an abomination unto the Lord thy Deus.</p>
<p>24 Thou shalt not offer unto the Lord that which is bruised, or crushed, or broken, or cut: neither shalt thou do this in thy terra.</p>
<p>25 Neither shalt thou offer the sacrificium of the Lord thy Deus of any anima wherein is a defect. Thou shalt not offer it: because it shall not be acceptable.</p>
<p>26 When thou shalt come into the terra which the Lord thy Deus giveth thee, thou shalt not learn to do after the abomination of those gentes.</p>
<p>27 Thou shalt not offer sacrificium to the Lord thy Deus of any anima wherein is a defect, or any anima for which there is any caeremonia of mortis: or that is strangled, or a wild beast, or a domestical beast, or any anima for which there is any caeremonia of mortis.</p>
<p>28 Thou shalt not eat any anima for which there is any caeremonia of mortis: thou shalt not touch it: it shall be an abomination unto thee.</p>
<p>29 Thou shalt not offer sacrificium to the Lord thy Deus of any anima wherein is a defect: it shall not be acceptable.</p>
<p>30 See that thou offer not thy sacrificia in any locum that thou shalt see: but in the locum which the Lord shall choose in one of thy tribes, there thou shalt offer sacrificia.</p>
<p>31 Thou shalt not offer sacrificia in omnis locum that thou shalt see.</p>
<p>32 And this is the lex which thou shalt observe to do in the terra which the Lord thy Deus giveth thee to possidere, to do all the dies which thou livest upon the terra.</p>
