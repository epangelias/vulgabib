                    <p>Thus saith the Lord, Where is the bill of your mother's divorcium, whom I have dimissus? or which of my creditors is it to whom I have venditus you? Behold, for your iniquitates were ye venditus, and for your scelus your mother was put away.</p>
<p>Why, when I came, was there no vir, when I called, was there none to respondere? Is my manus shortened at all, that there is no redemption in me? behold, at my vocem I will evaporare the mare, and make the flumina aridus: the pisces shall be gathered together, because there is no aqua, and shall mori, because the flumina are aridus.</p>
<p>I will vestire the caelum with tenebrae, and make sackcloth their coverings.</p>
<p>The Dominus Deus hath given me linguam eruditorum, that I should know how to succurrere the wearied with sermonem: he wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine aurem to hear as the eruditi.</p>
<p>The Dominus Deus hath opened mine aurem, and I was not rebellis, neither turned away back.</p>
<p>I gave my back to those that struck me, and my genas to them that plucked off the pilus: I hid not my faciem from shame and spuendo.</p>
<p>For the Dominus Deus will help me, therefore shall I not be confusus: therefore have I set my faciem like a petra, and I know that I shall not be ashamed.</p>
<p>He is near that justificat me; who will contend with me? let us stand together: who is mine adversary? let him approach me.</p>
<p>Behold, the Dominus Deus will help me; who is he that shall condemn me? lo, they all shall wax old as a vestis; the moth shall eat them up.</p>
<p>Who is among you that feareth the Dominus, that obeyeth the vox of his servus, that walketh in tenebrae, and hath no lumen? let him trust in the nomine of the Dominus, and stay upon his Deus.</p>
<p>Behold, all ye that kindle a ignis, that compass yourselves about with flammae: walk in the lumen of your ignis, and in the flammae which ye have kindled. This shall ye have of mine manus; ye shall lie down in dolor.</p>
