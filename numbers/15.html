                    <p>Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land of your habitatio, which I give unto you, and will make an oblatio of a holocaust, or a sacrificium for a especial vow, or in a voluntarium offering, or in your solemnities unto the Domine, to make a sweet savour unto him, of the pecora, or of the greges,</p>
<p>Ye shall offer with the holocaust, or sacrificium, a tenth deal of simila, mingled with the fourth part of an hin of oleum,</p>
<p>And of vinum, thou shalt offer the fourth part of an hin, for a libamen, of the same measure, for one beest, or for one arietem,</p>
<p>Or for a vitulus of the greges, thou shalt offer the sixth part of an epha of simila, mingled with the third part of an hin of oleum,</p>
<p>And of vinum, for a libamen, thou shalt offer the third part of an hin, to make a sweet savour unto the Domine,</p>
<p>And when thou preparest a vitulus, or a arietem for a holocaust, or for a sacrificium, to pay thy vow, or a voluntarium offering unto the Domine,</p>
<p>Thou shalt offer with the vitulus, or with the arietem, the tenth part of an epha of simila, mingled with the fourth part of an hin of oleum,</p>
<p>And the third part of an hin of vinum for a libamen, of the same measure, thou shalt offer unto the Domine,</p>
<p>And when thou preparest a vitulus of the greges for a holocaust, or for a sacrificium, to pay thy vow, or a voluntarium offering unto the Domine,</p>
<p>Thou shalt offer with the vitulus of the greges, the tenth part of an epha of simila, mingled with the fourth part of an hin of oleum,</p>
<p>And the fourth part of an hin of vinum for a libamen, of the same measure, thou shalt offer unto the Domine,</p>
<p>This shall be the law for thy generations, and in all your habitatio, of the pecora, or of the greges, when ye offer a holocaust, or a sacrificium, to make a sweet savour unto the Domine,</p>
<p>That the son of the alien, or the peregrinus, that is among you, may offer an oblatio of a holocaust, or a sacrificium, to make a sweet savour unto the Domine, as ye do, and that he may offer it according to the law of you,</p>
<p>One law, and one manner shall be for you, and for the peregrinus that peregrinat among you,</p>
<p>Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land to which I bring you,</p>
<p>Then it shall be, that when ye eat of the panis of the land, ye shall offer up an heave-offering unto the Domine,</p>
<p>Ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an heave-offering, as ye do the heave-offering of the granary, so shall ye heave it,</p>
<p>Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the Domine an heave-offering in your generations,</p>
<p>And if ye have erred, and not observed all these commandamenta, which the Domine hath spoken unto Moses,</p>
<p>Even all that the Domine hath commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the day that the Domine commanded Moses, and henceforward among your generations,</p>
<p>Then it shall be, if ought be committed by ignorance without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young vitulus for a holocaust, for a sweet savour unto the Domine, with his oblatio, and his libamen, according to the law, and one caper for peccatum unto the sacerdos, who shall make reconciliatio for the people of Israel,</p>
<p>And it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the children of Israel, and the peregrinus that peregrinat among them, seeing all the people were in ignorance,</p>
<p>And if any soul sin through ignorance against any of the commandamenta of the Domine, and do that which is not to be done, and be guilty,</p>
<p>Or if his peccatum, which he hath sinned, come to his knowledge, then he shall bring his oblatio, a she-goat of the greges, a kid of the goats for his peccatum,</p>
<p>And the sacerdos shall make reconciliatio for him concerning his peccatum, and it shall be forgiven him,</p>
<p>And if any soul of the people of the land sin through ignorance, by doing somewhat against any of the commandamenta of the Domine, which ought not to be done, and be guilty,</p>
<p>Or if his peccatum come to his knowledge, that he hath sinned against the Domine, then he shall bring his oblatio, a she-goat of the greges, without blemish, for his peccatum, unto the sacerdos,</p>
<p>And the sacerdos shall make reconciliatio for him concerning his peccatum, and it shall be forgiven him,</p>
<p>And the peregrinus that peregrinat among them, shall do as thou doest, and shall offer an oblatio of a sweet savour unto the Domine, as thou doest, that it may be unto thee for a sweet savour, and unto the peregrinus as unto thee,</p>
<p>One law and one manner shall be for you, and for the peregrinus that peregrinat with you,</p>
<p>And the Domine spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p>Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land of your habitatio, which I give unto you,</p>
<p>Then it shall be, that the land shall keep a sabbatum unto the Domine,</p>
<p>Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof,</p>
<p>But in the seventh year shall be a sabbatum of rest unto the land, a sabbatum for the Domine, thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard,</p>
<p>That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest, thou shalt not reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed, for it is a year of rest unto the land,</p>
<p>And the sabbatum of the land shall be meat for you, for thee, and for thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant, and for thy peregrinus that sojourneth with thee,</p>
<p>And for thy cattle, and for the beast that are in thy land, shall all the increase thereof be meat,</p>
<p>And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years, and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years,</p>
<p>Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month, in the day of the reconciliation, ye shall make the trumpet to sound throughout all your land,</p>
<p>And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim libertatem throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof, it shall be a jubilee unto you, and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family,</p>
<p>A jubilee shall that fiftieth year be unto you, ye shall not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather the grapes in it of thy vine undressed,</p>
<p>For it is the jubilee, it shall be holy unto you, ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field,</p>
<p>In the year of this jubilee ye shall return every man unto his possession,</p>
<p>And if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour, or buyest ought of thy neighbour's hand, ye shall not oppress one another,</p>
<p>According to the number of years after the jubilee thou shalt buy of thy neighbour, and according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee,</p>
<p>According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it, for according to the number of the years of the fruits doth he sell unto thee,</p>
<p>Ye shall not oppress one another, but thou shalt fear thy Deus, for I am the Domine your Deus,</p>
<p>Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judicia, and do them, and ye shall dwell in the land in securitatem,</p>
<p>And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, and dwell therein in securitatem,</p>
<p>And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year, behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase,</p>
<p>Then I will command my benediction upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for three years,</p>
<p>And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year, until her fruit come in ye shall eat of the old store,</p>
<p>The land shall not be sold for ever, for the land is mine, for ye are peregrini and sojourners with me,</p>
<p>And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land,</p>
<p>If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away some of his possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he redeem that which his brother sold,</p>
<p>And if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to redeem it,</p>
<p>Then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it, that he may return unto his possession,</p>
<p>But if he be not able to restore it to him, then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubilee, and in the jubilee it shall go out, and he shall return unto his possession,</p>
<p>And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold, within a full year may he redeem it,</p>
<p>And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall be established for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations, and shall not go out in the jubilee,</p>
<p>But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country, they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubilee,</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, and the houses of the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at all times,</p>
<p>And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in the year of jubilee, for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel,</p>
<p>But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold, for it is their perpetual possession,</p>
<p>And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee, then thou shalt relieve him, yea, though he be a peregrinus or a sojourner, that he may live with thee,</p>
<p>Take thou no usura of him, or increase, but fear thy Deus, that thy brother may live with thee,</p>
<p>Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usura, nor lend him thy victuals for increase,</p>
<p>I am the Domine your Deus, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your Deus,</p>
<p>And if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor, and be sold unto thee, thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant,</p>
<p>But as an hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be with thee, and shall serve thee unto the year of jubilee,</p>
<p>And then shall he depart from thee, both he and his children with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return,</p>
<p>For they are my servi, which I brought forth out of the land of Egypt, they shall not be sold as bondmen,</p>
<p>Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour, but shalt fear thy Deus,</p>
<p>Both thy manservants, and thy maidservants, which thou shalt have, shall be of the heathen that are round about you, of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids,</p>
<p>Moreover of the children of the peregrini that do sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that are with you, which they begat in your land, and they shall be your possession,</p>
<p>And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit them for a possession, they shall be your bondmen for ever, but over your brethren the children of Israel, ye shall not rule one over another with rigour,</p>
<p>And if a sojourner or peregrinus wax rich by thee, and thy brother that dwelleth by him wax poor, and sell himself unto the peregrinus or sojourner by thee, or to the stock of the peregrinus’ family,</p>
<p>After that he is sold he may be redeemed again, one of his brethren may redeem him,</p>
<p>Either his uncle, or his uncle's son may redeem him, or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him, or if he be able, he may redeem himself,</p>
<p>And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him unto the year of jubilee, and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years, according to the time of an hired servant shall he be with him,</p>
<p>If there be yet many years behind, according unto them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for,</p>
<p>And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubilee, then he shall count with him, and according unto his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption,</p>
<p>As a yearly hired servant shall he be with him, and the other shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight,</p>
<p>And if he be not redeemed in these years, then he shall go out in the year of jubilee, both he, and his children with him,</p>
<p>For unto me the children of Israel are servi, they are my servi whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt, I am the Domine your Deus.</p>
