                    <p>Vanity of Vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity.</p>
<p>Quid prodest homini, si lucretur universum mundum et perdat animam suam? What profit hath a man of all his labour, which he taketh under the sol?</p>
<p>Generatio praeterit, et generatio venit, terra autem in aeternum stat. One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the terra abideth for ever.</p>
<p>Orirus est sol, et occidit, et in locum suum revertitur, ibique renascetur. The sol also ariseth, and the sol goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose.</p>
<p>Veniunt flati spiritus, et revertuntur in circulum suum, et in circulo suo currunt. The flati also of the ventus returneth again according to his circuits.</p>
<p>Omnia flumina currunt in mare, et mare non redundat, ad loca, unde exeunt, revertuntur, ut iterum currant. All the flumina run into the mare, yet the mare is not full; unto the place from whence the flumina come, thither they return again.</p>
<p>Cuncta res, quae fiunt, in laboriosis suis laborant, nec potest homo eloqui illud, quod deficit. The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sol.</p>
<p>Estne aliquid, de quo dicatur: Ecce, hoc novum est? ita, quod jam fuerit, ante secula, quae oblivioni tradita sunt. Is there any thing, whereof it may be said, See, this is novus? it hath been already of old time, which was before us.</p>
<p>Non est memoria priorum, nec futurorum erit memoria apud eos, qui postea nascentur. There is no memoriam of former things; neither shall there be any memoriam of things that are to come with those that shall come after.</p>
<p>Ego Ecclesiastes fui rex Israel in Hierusalem. I the Preacher was rex Israel in Hierusalem.</p>
<p>Dedique cor meum, ut inquirerem et perscrutarer sapientiam in cunctis, quae fiunt sub solari. And I gave my cor to seek and search out sapientia concerning all things that are done under the sol.</p>
<p>Hoc autem laboriosum est, quod laboravit Deus, ut corrigat, quod pravum est, et quoniam in multis operibus non inveni sapientiam. This sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith.</p>
<p>Vidi cuncta, quae fiunt sub solare, et ecce universa vanitas et afflictio spiritus. I have seen all the works that are done under the sol; and, behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit.</p>
<p>Praevalebit sapientia ignorantiam, sicut lucem tenebris exsuperat. Then I saw that sapientia excelleth folly, as far as lucem excelleth tenebrae.</p>
<p>Et tamen cor sapientis est, tam in dextris quam in sinistris, et sapientia est, ut scias et intelligas omnia. The eyes of the sapient are in his dexter, but the stultus walketh in tenebris: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all.</p>
<p>Dixi in corde meo: Eo, quod stultus est, et dabo mihi cor in via stultitiae, ut sciam et probem omnia, quae fiunt in terra, et ut viderem, quid esset in omni labore, quo laborat homo in terra. I said in mine cor, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also is vanity.</p>
<p>Risi corde meo et dixi in gaudio: Non est tibi sanitas in gaudio. I said of laughter, It is mad; and of mirth, What doeth it?</p>
<p>Loquens corde meo, ut scirem, et scrutarer et requirerem sapientiam et rationem et ut scirem stultitiam et erroribus. I spoke in mine cor, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more sapientia than all they that have been before me in Hierusalem: yea, my cor had great experience of sapientia and knowledge.</p>
<p>Et applicui cor meum, ut scirem et addiscerem et custodirem sapientiam, quae vera est, et stultitiam et erroribus. And I gave my cor to know sapientia, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.</p>
<p>Quia in multa sapientia, multa infirmitas, et qui addit scientiam, addit et laborem. For in much sapientia is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.</p>
