  "O Lord, rebuke me not in thy ira, neither chasten me in thy furor.",
  "For thine sagittae stick fast in me, and thy manus presseth me sore.",
  "There is no sana caro in my carne; for the sake of thy indignatio.",
  "My peccata have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the capilli of mine head; therefore my cor heart faileth me.",
  "Lord, all my desiderium is before thee; and my gemitus is not hid from thee.",
  "My cor is troubled; my virtus hath left me; and the lux of mine oculi, it is gone from me.",
  "My amici and my socii stand aloof from my plaga; and my propinqui stand far off.",
  "They also that require my anima lay snares for me; and they that seek my malum speak mischievous things, and imagine fraudes all the die.",
  "But I, as a surdus, heard not; and I was as a mutus that openeth not his os.",
  "Thus I was as a homo that heareth not, and in whose os are no reprehensiones.",
  "For in thee, O Lord, do I sperare; thou wilt avertere my face from my inimici.",
  "Hear my oratio, O Lord, and attend to my petitio; hearken unto me, for thy misericordia is bonus.",
  "Turn not away thy facies from thy servus; for I am in angustia; hear me speedily.",
  "Draw nigh unto my anima, and redime me; salva me propter inimicos meos.",
  "They that seek my anima, to destroy it, shall go into the infernus.",
  "They shall fall by the gladius; they shall be a partitio for foxes.",
  "But the rex shall rejoice in Deo; every one that iurat by him shall gloriari; for the os of those that speak mendacium shall be stopped."
