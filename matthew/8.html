                    <p>And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed him.</p>
<p>And, behold, there arose a great tempest in mari, so that the ship was covered with the fluctus: but he was asleep.</p>
<p>And his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying, Domine, salva nos: we perish.</p>
<p>And he saith unto them, Why are ye timidi, O ye of little fides? Then he arose, and rebuked the ventus and the sea; and there was a great tranquillitas.</p>
<p>And the homines marvelled, saying, What manner of homo is this, that even the venti and the sea obey him!</p>
<p>And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two daemonia out of the monumenta, coming from the sepulchra, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way.</p>
<p>And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesu, Fili Dei? art thou come hither to torment us before the tempus?</p>
<p>And there was a herd of many porci feeding on the monte: and the daemonia besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer us to go away into the herd of porci.</p>
<p>And he said unto them, Go. And when they were come out, they went into the herd of porci: and, behold, the whole herd of porci ran violently down a steep place into the mare, and perished in the aqua.</p>
<p>And they that kept them fled, and went their ways into the civitas, and told every thing, and what was befallen to the daemoniaci.</p>
<p>And, behold, the whole civitas came out to meet Jesu: and when they saw him, they besought him that he would depart out of their coasts.</p>
<p>And he entered into a navis, and passed over, and came into his own civitas.</p>
<p>And, behold, they brought to him a paralyticus, lying on a grabatus: and Jesu seeing their fides said unto the paralyticus; Son, be of good comfort; thy peccata are forgiven thee.</p>
<p>And, behold, certain of the scribae said within themselves, This man blasphemeth.</p>
<p>And Jesu knowing their cogitationes said, Wherefore think ye evil in your corda?</p>
<p>For whether is easier, to say, Thy peccata are forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and ambula?</p>
<p>But that ye may know that the Filius hominis hath potestas on earth to forgive peccata, (then saith he to the paralyticus,) Arise, take up thy grabatus, and vade to thine house.</p>
<p>And he arose, and departed to his house.</p>
<p>But when the multitudes saw it, they marvelled, and glorified Deus, which had given such potestas unto homines.</p>
<p>And as Jesu passed forth from thence, he saw a publicanus, named Matthew, sitting at the telonium: and he saith unto him, Sequere me. And he arose, and secutus est him.</p>
<p>And it came to pass, as Jesu sat at mensa in the house, behold, many publicani and peccatores came and sat down with him and his disciples.</p>
<p>And when the Pharisaee saw it, they said unto his disciples, Why eateth your magister with publicanis and peccatoribus?</p>
<p>But when Jesu heard that, he said unto them, They that are valentes need not a medicus, but they that are infirmi.</p>
<p>Go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have misericordia, and not sacrificium: for I am not come to call the justi, but peccatores to paenitentia.</p>
<p>Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisaee jejunamus oft, but thy disciples jejunant not?</p>
<p>And Jesu said unto them, Can the filii of the sponsi mourn, as long as the sponsus is with them? but the dies will come, when the sponsus shall be taken from them, and then shall they jejunare.</p>
<p>No man putteth a piece of new vestis upon an old vestis, for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the vestis, and the rent is made worse.</p>
<p>Neither do homines put new vinum into old utres, else the utres break, and the vinum runneth out, and the utres perish: but they put new vinum into new utres, and both are preserved.</p>
