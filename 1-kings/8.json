  "Then Solomon spake unto all Israel, the principes of the tribes, and the capites of the patres of the filii of Israel, and they offered sacrificia before the arca, and the sacerdotes bare the arca of the foedus of the Lord.",
  "And they brought up the arca, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the sanctuaria that were in the tabernacle, these the sacerdotes and the Levites brought up.",
  "And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel that were assembled unto him before the arca, were sacrificando victimas oves and boves, which could not be told nor numbered for multitude.",
  "And the sacerdotes brought in the arca of the foedus of the Lord unto his locum, into the oraculum of the templum, unto the Sanctum Sanctorum, under the alas of the cherubim.",
  "For the cherubim spread forth their alas over the locum of the arca, and the cherubim covered the arca and the staves thereof above.",
  "And they drew out the staves of the arca, that the capites of the staves were seen in the Sanctum before the oraculum, but they were not seen without. And there they are unto this dies.",
  "And Solomon went up thither before the arca, and offered sacrificia of boves and oves, which could not be told nor numbered.",
  "And the sacerdotes brought forth the arca of the foedus of the Lord out of the tabernacle, to place it in its locum, in the Sanctum Sanctorum of the templum, under the alas of the cherubim.",
  "And it came to pass, when the sacerdotes were come out of the Sanctum, that a nubes filled the templum of the Lord.",
  "So that the sacerdotes could not stand to minister because of the nubes: for the gloria of the Lord had filled the templum of the Lord.",
  "Then spake Solomon, The Lord said that he would dwell in the caligo.",
  "I have surely built thee an domus to dwell in, a stabile locum for thee to abide in for ever.",
  "And the king turned his facies about, and blessed all the congregation of Israel: and all the congregation of Israel stood.",
  "And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, who spake with his os unto David my pater, and hath with his manus fulfilled it, saying,",
  "Since the dies that I brought forth my populus Israel out of Aegypto, I chose no civitas among all the tribes of Israel to build an domus in, that my Nomen might be there; but I chose David to be over my populus Israel.",
  "And it was in the cor of David my pater to build an domus to the Nomen of the Lord God of Israel.",
  "And the Lord said unto David my pater, Forasmuch as it was in thy cor to build an domus unto my Nomen, thou didst well that it was in thy cor.",
  "Notwithstanding thou shalt not build the domus; but thy filius that shall come forth out of thy lumbus, he shall build the domus unto my Nomen.",
  "And the Lord hath performed his verbum that he spake, and I am risen up in the locum of David my pater, and sit on the solium of Israel, as the Lord promised, and have built an domus to the Nomen of the Lord God of Israel.",
  "And I have set there a locum for the arca, wherein is the foedus of the Lord, which he made with our patres, when he brought them out of the terra of Aegyptus.",
  "And Solomon stood before the arca of the foedus of the Lord in the sight of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his manus toward caelum,",
  "And said, O Lord God of Israel, there is no Deus like thee in caelum above, or on terra beneath, who keepest foedus and misericordia with thy servos that walk before thee with totum cor.",
  "Who hast kept with thy servus David my pater that thou promisedst him: thou spakest also with thy os, and hast fulfilled it with thy manus, as it is this dies.",
  "Now therefore, O Lord God of Israel, keep with thy servus David my pater that thou promisedst him, saying, There shall not fail thee a vir before me to sit on the solium of Israel; so that thy filii take heed to their via, that they walk before me as thou hast walked before me.",
  "And now, O God of Israel, let thy verbum, I pray thee, be verified, which thou spakest unto thy servus David my pater.",
  "But will God indeed dwell on terra? behold, the caelum and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this domus that I have builded?",
  "Yet have thou respect unto the preces of thy servus, and to his deprecation, O Lord my Deus, to hearken unto the clamor and the preces, which thy servus prayeth before thee to die.",
  "That thine oculus may be open toward this domus night and day, even toward the locum of which thou hast said, My Nomen shall be there: that thou mayest hearken unto the preces which thy servus shall make toward this locum.",
  "And hearken thou to the preces of thy servus, and of thy populus Israel, when they shall pray toward this locum: yea, hear thou in heaven thy dwelling locum: and when thou hearest, forgive.",
  "If any man trespass against his proximus, and an execratio be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and the execratio come before thy altare in this domus:",
  "Then hear thou in heaven, and do, and judge thy servos, condemning the impium, and bringing his via upon his caput; and justifying the justum, and giving him according to his justitia.",
  "When thy populus Israel be smitten down before the inimicus, because they have sinned against thee, and shall turn again to thee, and confess thy Nomen, and pray, and make supplication unto thee in this domus:",
  "Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the peccatum of thy populus Israel, and bring them again unto the terra which thou gavest unto their patres.",
  "When caelum shall be shut up, and there is no imber, because they have sinned against thee: if they pray toward this locum, and confess thy Nomen, and turn from their peccata, when thou afflictest them:",
  "Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the peccata of thy servos, and of thy populus Israel, that thou teach them the bona via wherein they should walk, and give imber upon thy terra, which thou hast given to thy populus for an hereditas.",
  "If there be in the terra famis, if there be pestilentia, blasting, mildew, locusta; if there be caterpillar; if their inimicus besiege them in the civitas of their terra; whatsoever plague, whatsoever sickness there be;",
  "Whatsoever preces, whatsoever supplication shall be made of any man, or of all thy populus Israel, when they shall know every man the plagam of his own cor, and spread forth his manus toward this domus:",
  "Then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling locus, and forgive, and do, and give every man according to his via, whose cor thou knowest; (for thou, even thou only, knowest the cor of all the filii of men;)",
  "That they may fear thee all the dies that they live in the terra which thou gavest unto our patres.",
  "Moreover concerning a stranger, that is not of thy populus Israel, but cometh out of a terra far off for thy Nomen's sake;",
  "(For they shall hear of thy magna nominatio, and of thy manus potentiosa, and of thy brachium stretched out,) when he shall come and pray toward this domus;",
  "Hear thou in heaven thy dwelling locus, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for: that all populi of the terra may know thy Nomen, to fear thee, as doth thy populus Israel; and that they may know that this domus, which I have builded, is called by thy Nomen.",
  "If thy populus go out to war against their inimicus, whithersoever thou shalt send them, and shall pray unto the Lord toward the civitas which thou hast chosen, and toward the domus that I have builded for thy Nomen:",
  "Then hear thou in heaven their preces and their supplication, and maintain their justa causa.",
  "If they sin against thee, (for there is no homo that sinneth not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the inimicus, so that they carry them away captivi unto the terra of the inimicus, far or near;",
  "Yet if they shall bethink themselves in the terra whither they were carried captivi, and turn and pray unto thee in the terra of their captivitas, saying, We have sinned, we have done perversely, we have acted impie;",
  "If they return to thee with all their cor, and with all their animus, in the terra of their inimicus, whither they were carried captivi, and pray toward their terra, which thou gavest unto their patres, the civitas which thou hast chosen, and the domus which I have builded for thy Nomen:",
  "Then hear thou their preces and their supplication in heaven thy dwelling locus, and maintain their justa causa,",
  "And forgive thy populus that have sinned against thee, and all their iniquitates wherein they have transgressed against thee, and give them compassion before them who carried them captivi, that they may have misericordia on them:",
  "For they be thy populus, and thine hereditas, which thou broughtest forth out of Aegyptus, from the midst of the fornax of ferreum.",
  "The oculi of all Israel shall be toward the Lord, saying, Pardon, I pray thee, the iniquitates of thy populus Israel, which thou hast brought forth out of the terra of Aegyptus; and give not thy terra, which thou hast given them, to the bestiae of the terra, lest they devour them.",
  "Then spake Solomon, The Lord said that he would dwell in the caligo.",
  "I have surely builded thee an domus to dwell in, a stabile locum for thee to abide in for ever.",
  "And the king turned his facies about, and blessed all the congregation of Israel: and all the congregation of Israel stood.",
  "And he said, Blessed be the Lord, that hath given rest unto his populus Israel, according to all that he promised: there hath not failed one verbum of all his bona promissa, which he promised by the manus of Moses his servus.",
  "The Lord our Deus be with us, as he was with our patres: let him not leave us, nor forsake us:",
  "That he may incline our cor unto him, to walk in all his via, and to keep his mandata, and his statuta, and his judicia, which he commanded our patres.",
  "And let these my verba, wherewith I have prayed before the Lord, be nigh unto the Lord our Deus day and night, that he maintain the justa causa of his servus, and of his populus Israel at all times, as the dies shall require:",
  "That all the populi of the terra may know that the Lord is Deus, and that there is none else.",
  "Let your cor therefore be perfect with the Lord our Deus, to walk in his statuta, and to keep his mandata, as at this dies."
