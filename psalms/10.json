  "1 Why standest thou afar off, O Deus, and hidest thyself in tempus of tribulation?",
  "2 The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor: let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined.",
  "3 For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desiderium, and blesseth the covetous, whom the Dominus abhorreth.",
  "4 The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after Deus: Deus is not in all his cogitationes.",
  "5 His viai are always grievous; thy judicia are far above out of his sight: as for all his enemies, he puffeth at them.",
  "6 He hath said in his cor, I shall not be moved: for I shall never be in adversitas.",
  "7 His os is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his lingua is miseria and iniquitas.",
  "8 He sitteth in insidiis with the princes of his populus, to lay wait in secret places for the innocent: his oculi are privily set against the poor.",
  "9 He lieth in wait secretly as a leo in his spelunca; he lieth in wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net.",
  "10 He croucheth, and humbleth himself, that the miseros may fall by his potentia.",
  "11 He hath said in his cor, Deus hath forgotten: he hideth his facies; he will never see it.",
  "12 Arise, O Dominus; O Deus, lift up thine manus: forget not the humiles.",
  "13 Wherefore doth the wicked contemn Deus? he hath said in his cor, Thou wilt not require it.",
  "14 Thou hast seen it; for thou beholdest miseria and sorrow, to requite it with thy manus: the poor committeth himself unto thee; thou art the adiutor of the orphan.",
  "15 Break thou the brachium of the wicked and the malignant: seek out his iniquitas, till thou find none.",
  "16 Deus reignedth for ever and ever: the gentes are perished out of his terra.",
  "17 Deus, thou hast heard the desiderium of the humiles: thou wilt prepare their cor, thou wilt cause thine aurem to hear:",
  "18 To judge the orphan and the oppressus, that the homo of the terra may no more terrify."
