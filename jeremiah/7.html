                    <p>1 The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:</p>
<p>2 To whom the word of the Dominus came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.</p>
<p>3 It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month.</p>
<p>4 Then the word of the Dominus came unto me, saying,</p>
<p>5 Before I formed thee in the uterus, I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb, I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the gentes.</p>
<p>6 Then said I, Ah, Dominus Deus, behold, I cannot speak: for I am a puer.</p>
<p>7 But the Dominus said unto me, Say not, I am a puer: for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak.</p>
<p>8 Be not afraid of their facies: for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith the Dominus.</p>
<p>9 Then the Dominus put forth his manus, and touched my os, and the Dominus said unto me, Behold, I have put my verba in thy mouth:</p>
<p>10 See, I have this day set thee over the gentes and over the regna, to radix up, and to destroy, and to dissipate, and to perish, and to build, and to plant.</p>
<p>11 Moreover the word of the Dominus came unto me, saying, Jeremiah, what seest thou? And I said, I see a virga of an amygdalus tree.</p>
<p>12 Then said the Dominus unto me, Thou hast well seen: for I will hasten my verbum to perform it.</p>
<p>13 And the word of the Dominus came unto me the second time, saying, What seest thou? And I said, I see a caldron boiling; and the facies thereof is toward the face of the Aquilon.</p>
<p>14 Then the Dominus said unto me, Out of the Aquilon an evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the terra.</p>
<p>15 For, lo, I will call all the families of the regna of the Aquilon, saith the Dominus; and they shall put every one his thronus at the entering of the portae of Jerusalem, and against all the muri thereof round about, and against all the civitates of Judah.</p>
<p>16 And I will utter my judicia against them touching all their wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have offered unto other dii, and worshipped the opera of their own manus.</p>
<p>17 Thou therefore gird up thy lumbi, and arise, and speak unto them all that I command thee: be not dismayed at their facies, lest I confundam thee before them.</p>
<p>18 For behold, I have made thee this day a munitionem of strong civitas, and a columna of iron, and walls of brass, against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the principes thereof, against the sacerdotes thereof, and against the populus of the land.</p>
<p>19 And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee, saith the Dominus, to deliver thee.</p>
<p>20 Thus saith the Dominus; Stand in the porta of the domus of the Dominus, and preach the word of the Dominus to all that enter in at these portae, and say, Hear the word of the Dominus, all ye of Judah, that enter in at these portae to worship the Dominus.</p>
<p>21 Thus saith the Dominus of the exercitus, the Deus of Israel; Put your burdens away from your necks, and bear ye no more the yoke of the gentes.</p>
<p>22 For thus saith the Dominus of the exercitus, the Deus of Israel; I will break his yoke from thy neck, and will burst thy bonds, and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him:</p>
<p>23 But they hearkened not, nor inclined their aurem, but walked every one in the imagination of their evil cor.</p>
<p>24 Therefore thus saith the Dominus; Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry unto me, I will not hear them.</p>
<p>25 Then shall the civitates of Judah and Jerusalem go, and cry unto the dii, unto whom they offer incense: but they shall not save them in the tempus of their affliction.</p>
<p>26 And when thou shalt say unto them, Let us not go after other dii, to serve them, and to worship them; for we will not hearken unto thee;</p>
<p>27 Therefore thou shalt say unto them, This is a nation that obeyeth not the voice of the Dominus their Deus, nor receiveth correction: fidelity is perished; and is cut off from their os.</p>
<p>28 Cut off thine hair, O Jerusalem, and cast it away, and take up a lamentation on high places; for the Dominus hath rejected and forsaken the generatio of his indignation.</p>
<p>29 For the filii of Judah have done evil in my sight, saith the Dominus: they have set their abomination in the domus, which is called by my nomine, to pollute it.</p>
<p>30 And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the valley of the filius of Hinnom, to burn their filii and their filiae in the ignis to Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my cor, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.</p>
<p>31 Therefore, behold, the dies come, saith the Dominus, that this place shall no more be called Tophet, nor The valley of the filius of Hinnom, but The valley of slaughter.</p>
<p>32 And I will make void the consilium of Judah and Jerusalem in this place; and I will cause them to fall before their inimici, and into the manus of them that seek their anima: and I will give their cadavera to be meat for the aves of the caelum, and for the bestiae of the terra.</p>
<p>33 And I will make this civitas desolate, and an hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished and hiss because of all the plagae thereof.</p>
<p>34 And I will make this civitas, and the civitates thereof, an everlasting desolation, saith the Dominus.</p>
<p>35 Thus saith the Dominus; They have found the sepulchres of their patres, and they have burned incense thereon, and have poured libamina: but ye have done evil above all that your patres have done; for, behold, ye walk every one after the imagination of your evil cor.</p>
<p>36 Therefore thus saith the Dominus; Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry unto me, I will not hear them.</p>
<p>37 And the civitas shall be given into the manus of the exercitus of the gentes, and they shall afflict the civitas, as I have spoken: because they obeyed not the voice of the Dominus their Deus, to keep his mandata and his testimonia; as it is written in the libro of the legem of Moses, with all his cor, and with all his anima.</p>
<p>38 Behold, I will gather them out of all the terrae, whither I have driven them in mine indignation, and in my furor, and in great ira; and I will bring them again unto this place, and I will make them to dwell safely:</p>
<p>39 And they shall be my populus, and I will be their Deus:</p>
<p>40 And I will give them one cor, and one via, that they may fear me for ever, for the bonum of them, and of their filii after them:</p>
<p>41 And I will make an everlasting foedus with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them bonum; but I will put my timor in their cordibus, that they shall not depart from me.</p>
<p>42 Yea, I will visit upon them the bonum that I have promised unto them, and I will make them to dwell in this terra, saith the Dominus.</p>
