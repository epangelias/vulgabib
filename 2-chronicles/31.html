                    <p>Hezekiah executeth the covenant with the priests and the Levites, 2 Chronicles 31:1</p>
<p>Hezekiah began to purge the idolatrous and covenant-breaking Israelites from their high places, asperitas and lucus, and brake the statuae, and cut down the lucus.</p>
<p>And the king commanded the Levites to minister before the Lord, to hallow Him, and to precare the populus, saying, Benedictio et veritas, in omni via, ut scriptum est in lege Domini.</p>
<p>And the king appointed the officia of the sacerdotes, and the Levites to their ministeria, ut scriptum est in libro Mosi, et to their distributionem, iuxta imperium David, patris sui, and to the primitias of the populus, secundum the familiae of the patriarchae.</p>
<p>And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote literae to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should venire to domus of the Lord, at Hierusalem, to celebrare Phase Domini, Deus of Israel.</p>
<p>For the king had taken counsel, and his principes, and the whole ecclesia in Hierusalem, to celebrare Phase in the secundus mensis.</p>
<p>For they could not keep it at that tempus, because the sacerdotes had not sanctificati themselves sufficiently, neque the populus gathered themselves together at Hierusalem.</p>
<p>And the thing pleased the king and the whole ecclesia, that they should proclamare through all Israel, from Beer-sheba even to Dan, that they should venire to keep the Phase unto the Lord God of Israel at Hierusalem, for they had not done it of a long tempus, in the manner it was scriptum.</p>
<p>So the literae went forth throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the imperium of the king, and his principes, the Levites did it, and sent to all Israel and Judah, saying, Ye sons of Israel, revertimini to the Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and He will reverti to the remnant of you, that are escaped out of the manu of the reges of Assur.</p>
<p>And be not like your patres, and like your fratres, qui prevaricati sunt against the Lord God of their patres, qui tradidit eos in desolationem, as ye see.</p>
<p>Now be ye not obstinati, as your patres were, but yield yourselves unto the Lord, and venite to sanctuarium of the Lord, which He hath sanctificatum for ever, and serve the Lord your God, that the fierceness of His ira may turn away from you.</p>
<p>For if ye reverti unto the Lord, your fratres and filii shall find misericordia before them that led them captivos, and they shall revenire to this terra, for the Lord your God is clemens and misericors, and will not turn away His faciem from you, if ye reveni unto Him.</p>
<p>So the litterati passed from citi to citi through the terra of Ephraim and Manasseh, even unto Zabulon, but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them.</p>
<p>Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zabulon were humiles, and venire to Hierusalem.</p>
<p>Also in Judah the manus of God was to give them one cor, to facere the imperium of the king and of the principes, concerning this matter.</p>
<p>And there assembled at Hierusalem much populus to keep the festum of azymes in the secundus mensis, a very great congregation.</p>
<p>And they arose and removed the altaria that were in Hierusalem, and all the altaria of incense took they away, and cast them into the torrent of Cedron.</p>
<p>Then they killed the Phase on the quartadecima die of the secundus mensis, and the sacerdotes and Levites were ashamed, and sanctificati themselves, and brought in holocausta to the domus of the Lord.</p>
<p>And they stood in their loci, according to their ordo, as it was scriptum in the libro of Moyses the man of God, the sacerdotes sprinkling the sanguinem, which they received of the manu of the Levites.</p>
<p>For there were many in the congregation that were not mundi, and therefore the Levites had the potestas to sanctificare all, and to facere them mundi, to offer to the Lord, even as it was scriptum in the libro of Moyses, and to facere the holocausta of the Lord, to placare Him for all Israel.</p>
<p>And the filii of Israel, that were present, celebraverunt the Phase, and the festum of azymes seven dies.</p>
<p>And the sacerdotes and Levites were standing in their loci, and were ministering with the instruments of sanctification, and the sacerdotes were killing the holocausta, to offer to the Lord.</p>
<p>And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the populus, that God had provided the populo, for the thing was done suddenly.</p>
<p>And Hezekiah sent to all them that were present with him to Hierusalem, to facere portionem to them that did not facere their portio, saying, The Lord hath spoken good of you, to purificare you.</p>
<p>Then the filii of Israel, that were present at Hierusalem, kept the festum of azymes seven dies with great gaudeo, and the Levites and sacerdotes were praising the Lord die per diem, singing with loud instruments unto the Lord.</p>
<p>And Hezekiah spake confortatively to all the Levites, that had good knowledge in the scripturis of the Lord, and did eat the festum seven dies, offering pacificas to the Lord, and confessing to the Lord God of their patres.</p>
<p>And the whole congregation took counsel to keep other seven dies, and they kept other seven dies with gaudeo.</p>
<p>For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a thousand young boues, and seven thousand oves, and the principes gave to the congregation two thousand young boues, and seven thousand oves, and the sacerdotes sanctificati themselves.</p>
<p>And all the congregation of Judah, with the sacerdotes and the Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the peregrini that came out of the terra of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.</p>
<p>So there was great gaudeo in Hierusalem, for since the tempus of Solomon the filius of David king of Israel there was not the like in Hierusalem.</p>
<p>And the sacerdotes and Levites arose and blessed the populum, and their vox was heard, and their oratio came up to His sanctuarium in coelum.</p>
