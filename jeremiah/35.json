  "The word which came unto Jeremiah from the Dominus, saying,",
  "Arise, and go down to the casa of the Rechabites, and speak unto them, and bring them into the domus of the Domini, into one of the cubiculi, and give them vinum to drink.",
  "For I had spoken unto Iezonias the filius of Ieremias, the filius of Habazinias, and unto his fratres, and unto all his filii, saying,",
  "Take not vinum, ye nor your filii for ever:",
  "Neither build ye domus, nor sow ye semen, nor plant ye vineas, nor have ye any: but in tabernaculis shall ye dwell all your dies:",
  "That ye may live many dies in the terra, ye and your filii, and your nepotes.",
  "But ye said, No, we will not hear this verbum; but we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth out of our own os,",
  "To drink vinum, we and our uxores, and our liberi, and our filiae, and all our familia,",
  "And to offer sacrificia to the regina caeli, and to pour out libamina unto her, as we have done, we and our patres, our reges, and our principes, in the urbes of Iudae, and in the viis Ierusalem: and we were filled with panis, and were mereri, and saw none malum.",
  "But since we ceased to offer sacrificia to the regina caeli, and to pour out libamina unto her, we have lacked omnia, and have been consummated by gladius and famis.",
  "Did not we certainly know, when we ceased to offer sacrificia to the regina caeli, and to pour out libamina unto her, that we should have nothing but consummari by gladius and famis?",
  "The uxores also do offer sacrificia unto her, and to pour out libamina unto her. Then if we do according to all the verba that proceed out of our os, to offer sacrificia to the regina caeli, and to pour out libamina unto her, shall we make any peccatum, that we have done according to all the verba that proceeded out of our os,",
  "To offer sacrificia to the regina caeli, and to pour out libamina unto her, and to offer libamina unto her?",
  "Because the Dominus hath spoken concerning the regina caeli, in whom ye delight, and have offered sacrificia to her, and have poured out libamina unto her, therefore shall he send, and take you, and transport you, and the reges who have reigned over you, into a terra which ye know not, ye nor your patres.",
  "Thus saith the Dominus of the exercitus, the Deus of Israel, Behold, I will set my facies against you for malum, to destroy all Iudam.",
  "And I will take the remnant of Iudam, which have set their facies to enter into the terra of Aegyptus to seek refuge there, and to dwell there, and they shall be consummated all, they shall fall in the terra of Aegyptus, they shall be consummated by gladius and by famis, from the parvus unto the magnus, by gladius and by famis shall they mori.",
  "And they shall be visitati, and puniri, and mori by gladius, by famis, and by pestis, till they be consummated from the terra which I gave unto them and their patres.",
  "But thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Dominus, Ye shall not obey the verbum of the prophetes which prophesy unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the regi Babilonis, that ye may dwell in the terra.",
  "Serve ye the regi Babilonis, and dwell in the terra, and prophesy unto them, saying, Thus saith the Dominus of the exercitus, the Deus of Israel, Behold, I will send and take Nabuchodonosor the rex Babilonis my servus, and will set his thronum upon these lapides which I have hid, and he shall extend his umbraculum upon them.",
  "And he shall slay the rex Babilonis, and destroy him, and the gentes which are with him, saith the Dominus.",
  "Beware that ye do not obey the verbum of the prophetes, which prophesy unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the regi Babilonis, for they prophesy a mendacium unto you.",
  "For I have not sent them, saith the Dominus, but they prophesy a mendacium in my nomine, that I might expellere you, and that ye might perish, ye and the prophetes who prophesy unto you.",
  "Also I spake to the sacerdotes, and to all this populus, saying, Thus saith the Dominus, Hearken not to the verba of your prophetes which prophesy unto you, saying, Behold, the vasa of the domus Domini shall now shortly be returned from Babilon, for they prophesy a mendacium unto you.",
  "Beware that ye do not hearken unto them, lest I should expellere you, and ye perish, ye and the prophetes who prophesy unto you, by the peccatum of your manuum.",
  "But if they be prophetes, and if the verbum Domini be with them, let them now make intercession to the Dominus of the exercitus, that the reliquiae of the vasa which remain in the domus Domini, and in the domus of the rex of Iudah, and in Ierusalem, go not to Babilon.",
  "For thus saith the Dominus of the exercitus concerning the columnas, and concerning the mare, and concerning the vasa of rest which are left in this civitas,",
  "Which Nabuchodonosor rex Babilonis took not, when he transportavit Iechonias filius of Ioiachim rex Iudah from Ierusalem to Babilon, and all the principes of Iudah and Ierusalem;",
  "That saith the Dominus of the exercitus, the Deus of Israel, concerning the vasa that remain in the domus Domini, and in the domus of the rex of Iudah, and in Ierusalem;",
  "They shall be transportati to Babilon, and there they shall be until the die that I visit them, saith the Dominus; then will I bring them up, and restore them to this locus.",
  "And now because ye have done all these opera, saith the Dominus, and I spake unto you, rising precium, and rising mane, and speaking, but ye did not hearken, therefore I will send for all the familia of the aquilon, saith the Dominus, and Nabuchodonosor rex Babilonis, my servus, and I will bring them against this terra, and against the inhabitants thereof, and against all these gentes round about, and will destroy them, and make them astoniti, and anathema, and astoniti for ever.",
  "Thus saith the Dominus of the exercitus, the Deus of Israel, Take this calix of the vinum of indignation at my manuum, and make all the gentes to whom I shall send thee to drink it.",
  "And they shall drink, and be astoniti, and be insaniri, because of the gladius that I will send among them.",
  "Then took I the calix at the manuum Domini, and made all the gentes to drink, unto whom the Dominus had sent me:",
  "To wit, Ierusalem, and the civitates of Iudah, and the reges thereof, to make them astoniti, and anathema, and astoniti for ever;",
  "Pharao rex Aegypti, and his servientes, and his principes, and all his populus;",
  "And all the alienigenae, and all the exercitus of the Pharao, which were in the terra Aegypti, and in the insulis of the mari.",
  "All the reges of the Uz, and all the reges of the Philistinorum, and Askalon, and Azzah, and Accaron, and the reliquiae of Ascalon, and the reliquiae of the mari,",
  "Edom, and Moab, and the filii Ammon.",
  "All the reges of Tyrus, and all the reges of Sidon, and the reges of the insulis which are beyond the mari.",
  "Dedan, and Theman, and Buz, and all that are in the angulus.",

  "All the reges of the aquilon, far and near, one with another, and all the reges of the terra, which are upon the superficies of the terra: and the rex of Sesach shall drink after them.",
  "And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Dominus of the exercitus, the Deus of Israel, Drink ye, and be inebriati, and vomite, and cadite, and ne moriamini, because of the gladium which I will send among you.",
  "And it shall be, if they refuse to take the calix at thy manuum to drink, then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the Dominus of the exercitus, Ye shall certainly drink.",
  "For, lo, I begin to visit mala in the civitas which is called by my nomine, and should ye be utterly puniri?",
  "Ye shall not be innocentes: for I will call, and I will clamare unto the gladius upon all the inhabitants of the terra, saith the Dominus of the exercitus.",
  "Thus saith the Dominus of the exercitus, Howl ye, O gentes, and be astoniti, for the Dominus hath adductus a consummation from the extremum terrae.",
  "And the terrestris clamor shall be in that die, and the rex Babilonis hath oppressus the gentes as the mare oppressus by the ventus.",
  "The gentes shall howl as the leo, and they shall roare as the filii leonis.",
  "Whilst the exercitus of the gentes ascendit to fight against thee, and thy civitas shall be laid waste, without inhabitantes.",
  "Thus saith the Dominus, Behold, I will render unto the rex Babilonis the mala of the rex Babilonis, and unto the terra his iniquitas, and I will take all the electi thereof, and I will consummare them, and I will destroy them, saith the Dominus.",
  "Thus saith the Dominus of the exercitus, the Deus of Israel, Drink thou, and be astoniti, and vomite, and cadite, and ne moriamini, because of the gladium which I will send among you.",
  "Howl, ye shepherds, and clamare, and lamentate, and vestite vos in saccis, because the dies of your visitatio are fulfilled.",
  "For the Dominus hath visitatus the gregem of his hereditas, the domus of Iacob for their peccata, he hath made them as a gregem of his exercitus.",
  "He hath destroyd them with the gladius of the gentes, and with the exercitus of the regi Babilonis, and with the exercitus of the regi Madai.",
  "For thus saith the Dominus of the exercitus, the Deus of Israel, The exercitus of the regi Babilonis hath oppressus me, as the mare oppressus by the ventus.",
  "Howl, ye pastores, and clamare, and lamentate, and vestite vos in saccis, for the dies of your visitatio are fulfilled, for the Dominus hath visitatus the gregem of his hereditas.",
  "The voces of the clamantis, and the howling of the pastores, and the lamentationes of the principes shall be heard, for the Dominus hath destroyed their pasture, and the visitatio of the gregem of his furor.",
  "The terra is astoniti, and the caeli cover themselves, because the Dominus hath spoken, and the exercitus of the gentes hath oppressus the terra.",
  "The gentes shall be astoniti, and the terrestris clamor shall be in that die, for the rex Babilonis hath oppressus the gentes as the mare oppressus by the ventus.",
  "For the gentes shall howl as the leo, and they shall roare as the filii leonis.",

  "The voces of the clamantis, and the howling of the pastores, and the lamentationes of the principes shall be heard, for the Dominus hath destroyed their pasture, and the visitatio of the gregem of his furor.",
  "The terra is astoniti, and the caeli cover themselves, because the Dominus hath spoken, and the exercitus of the gentes hath oppressus the terra.",
  "Behold, I will send, and take all the familia of the aquilon, saith the Dominus, and Nabuchodonosor rex Babilonis, my servus, and I will bring them against this terra, and against the inhabitants thereof, and against all these gentes round about, and will destroy them, and make them astoniti, and anathema, and astoniti for ever.",
