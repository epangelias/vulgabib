                    <p>Blessed is the homo, that feareth the Dominus, that delighteth greatly in his mandata.</p>
<p>His seed shall be mighty upon terra, the generatio of the recti shall be blessed.</p>
<p>Wealth and richesse shall be in his domus: and his iustitia endureth for ever and ever.</p>
<p>Unto the iustus there ariseth lumen in tenebris: he is gracilis, and miseratur, and iustus.</p>
<p>A benevolent homo, and lender, that dispenses his negotia with discretion: for he shall never be moved.</p>
<p>The malus shall not be able to resist him: but the iusti shall be in memoriam aeternam.</p>
<p>He shall not be afraid of malum tidings: his cor is fixed, trusting in the Domine.</p>
<p>His cor is established, he shall not be afraid, until he see his desideria upon his enemies.</p>
<p>He hath dispersed, he hath given to the pauper: his iustitia remaineth for ever; his cornu shall be exalted with gloria.</p>
<p>The peccator shall see it, and be angry, he shall gnash with his dentes, and melt away: the desideria of the peccatores shall perish.</p>
