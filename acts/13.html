                    <p>Now there were in the church that was at Antioch, certi discipuli, as Barnabas, and Simeon who was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saulus.</p>
<p>As they ministered to the Dominus, and fasted, the Holy Spiritus said, Separate me Barnabas and Saulus for the opus, whereunto I have called them.</p>
<p>And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid manus upon them, they sent them away.</p>
<p>So they, being sent forth by the Spiritus Sanctus, departed unto Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.</p>
<p>And when they were at Salamis, they preached the verbum Domini in the synagogues of the Iudaei: and they had also Ioannes to their minister.</p>
<p>And when they had gone through the island unto Paphos, they found a certus magus, a false propheta, a Iudaeus, whose name was Bariesus:</p>
<p>Which was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a prudentissimus man: who called for Barnabas and Saulus, and desired to hear the verbum Domini.</p>
<p>But Elymas the magus (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn away the proconsul from the fides.</p>
<p>Then Saulus, (who also is called Paulus,) filled with the Spiritus Sanctus, set his oculus upon him,</p>
<p>And said, O plenus omnibus fraude, and malitia, thou filius Diaboli, thou hostis omnis iustitiae, wilt thou not cease to pervertere the recte vias Domini?</p>
<p>And now, behold, the manus Domini is upon thee, and thou shalt be caecus, not seeing the solem, for a season. And immediately there fell on him a caligo and a tenebrae; and he went about, seeking some to ducere manum in manu.</p>
<p>Then the proconsul, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the doctrina Domini.</p>
<p>Now when Paulus and his companions loosed from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia: and Ioannes departing from them returned to Hierosolyma.</p>
<p>But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antiochia in Pisidia, and went into the synagoga on the dies sabbati, and sat down.</p>
<p>And after the lectio of the lex and prophetarum, the principes of the synagoga sent unto them, saying, Ye homines fratres, if ye have any verbum exhortationis for the populus, say on.</p>
<p>Then Paulus stood up, and beckoning with his manus said, Men of Israel, and ye that fear Deum, give audience.</p>
<p>The Deus of this populus Israel chose our patres, and exalted the populum when they dwelt as strangers in the terra Aegypti, and with arm erectus he brought them out of it.</p>
<p>About the space of xl years suffered he their manners in the desert.</p>
<p>And when he had destroyed septem gentes in the terra Chanaan, he divided their terra to them by lot.</p>
<p>And after that he gave unto them iudices about the space of iv hundred and fifty years, until Samuel propheta.</p>
<p>And afterward they desired a rex: and Deus gave them Saulus the filius Cis, a vir of the tribu Benjamin, by the space of xl years.</p>
<p>And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David rex; to whom also he gave testimonium, and said, I have found David the filius Iesse, a vir after mine own cor, which shall fulfill all my voluntas.</p>
<p>Of this man's semen hath Deus according to his promissio raised unto Israel a Salvatorem, Iesum:</p>
<p>When Ioannes had first preached before his ingressus the baptismum of paenitentia to all the populus Israel.</p>
<p>And as Ioannes fulfilled his cursus, he said, Whom think ye that I am? I am not he. But, behold, there cometh one after me, whose calceus of his pedes I am not worthy to loose.</p>
<p>Men and fratres, filii of the generatio of Abraham, and whosoever among you feareth Deum, to you is the verbum of this salvus sent.</p>
<p>For they that dwelt at Hierosolyma, and their principes, because they knew him not, nor yet the voces of the prophetarum which are read every sabbatum, they have fulfilled them in condemning him.</p>
<p>And though they found no causa mortis in him, yet desired they Pilatum that he should be slain.</p>
<p>And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took him down from the lignum, and laid him in a sepulchre.</p>
<p>But Deus raised him from the mortui the third die,</p>
<p>And he was seen many dies of them which came up with him from Galilaea to Hierosolyma, who are his testes unto the populus.</p>
<p>And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promissio which was made unto the patres,</p>
<p>God hath fulfilled the same unto us their filii, in that he hath raised up Iesum again; as it is also written in the secundus psalm, Thou art my Filius, this day have I begotten thee.</p>
<p>And as concerning that he raised him up from the mortui, now no more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will give you the sancta promissa of David.</p>
<p>Wherefore he saith also in another psalm, Thou shalt not suffer thy Sanctus to see corruption.</p>
<p>For David, after he had served his own generation by the voluntas of Deus, fell asleep, and was laid unto his patres, and saw corruption:</p>
<p>But he, whom Deus raised again, saw no corruption.</p>
<p>Be it known unto you therefore, homines fratres, that through this man is preached unto you the remissio peccatorum:</p>
<p>And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the lex of Moses.</p>
<p>Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in the prophetarum;</p>
<p>Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I work a opus in your dies, a opus which ye shall in no wise believe, if a man declare it unto you.</p>
