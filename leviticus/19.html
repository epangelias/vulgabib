                    <p>Ye shall be holy: for I the Dominus thy Deus am holy.</p>
<p>Every man that curseth his pater or mater shall surely be put to morte: he hath cursed his pater or mater; his sanguis shall be upon him.</p>
<p>Ye shall fear every homo his mater and pater, and keep my Sabbata: I am the Dominus your Deus.</p>
<p>Turn ye not unto idola, nor make to yourselves molten deos: I am the Dominus your Deus.</p>
<p>And if ye offer a sacrificium of pacificatio unto the Dominus, ye shall offer it at your own voluntas.</p>
<p>It shall be eaten the same die, and on the morrow: and if ought remain until the tertius die, it shall be burnt in ignis.</p>
<p>For whosoever eateth it on the tertius die, it is an abominatio: it shall not be accepted.</p>
<p>Therefore every anima that eateth it shall bear iniquitas, because he hath profaned the sanctuarium of the Dominus: and that anima shall be exterminata from among his populus.</p>
<p>Ye shall not steale, neither deal falsely, neither lie one to another.</p>
<p>And ye shall not sweare by my nomine falsely, neither shalt thou profane the nomine of thy Deus: I am the Dominus.</p>
<p>Thou shalt not defraud thy proximus, neither rob him: the wages of him that is hired shall not remain with thee all nocte until mane.</p>
<p>Thou shalt not curse the surdus, nor put a stumblingblock before the caecus, but shalt fear thy Deus: I am the Dominus.</p>
<p>Ye shall do no iniquitas in iudicium: thou shalt not respect the persona of the pauper, nor honour the facies of the potens: but in iustitia shalt thou iudicare thy proximus.</p>
<p>Thou shalt not go up and down as a detractor among thy populus, neither shalt thou stand against the sanguis of thy proximus: I am the Dominus.</p>
<p>Thou shalt not hate thy frater in corde: thou shalt in arguendo rebuke thy proximus, that thou bear not peccatum for him.</p>
<p>Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the filii of thy populus, but thou shalt love thy proximus as thyself: I am the Dominus.</p>
<p>Ye shall keep my statuta. Thou shalt not make thy anima to copulate with anima of different genus: thou shalt not sow thy ager with diversa semina: thou shalt not wear vestem of diversa textura, of lanarum and lini.</p>
<p>Also thou shalt not lie carnally with thy proxima, to uncover her nuditas.</p>
<p>Thou shalt not discover the nuditas of thy soror, the filia of thy pater, or filia of thy mater, whether she were born at home, or born abroad.</p>
<p>Neither shalt thou discover the nuditas of thy filia of thy filius, or of thy filia of thy filia.</p>
<p>Thou shalt not uncover the nuditas of thy soror of thy pater, or of thy mater: for he uncovered his sanguis: their iniquitas shall be upon them.</p>
<p>And if a vir shall lie with the uxor of his patruus, he hath uncovered his patruus nuditas: they shall bear their iniquitas; they shall die childless.</p>
<p>If a vir shall take his soror, his filia of his pater, or filia of his mater, and see her nuditas, and she see his nuditas; it is a vilis facto: and they shall be exterminata in the presence of the filii of their populus: he hath uncovered his soror nuditas; he shall bear his iniquitas.</p>
<p>And if a vir shall lie with a mulier having her menstruum, and shall uncover her nuditas, he hath discovered her fons, and she hath uncovered the fons of her sanguis: and both of them shall be exterminata from among their populus.</p>
<p>Neither shalt thou lie with thy mater of thy uxor, nor discover her nuditas.</p>
<p>Thou shalt not give any of thy semina unto Molech, neither shalt thou profane the nomine of thy Deus: I am the Dominus.</p>
<p>Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with the mulier: it is abomination.</p>
<p>Neither shalt thou lie with any bestia, to defile thyself therewith: neither shall any femina stand before a bestia to lie with it: it is confusion.</p>
<p>Defile not ye your anima in any of these things: for in all these the gentes which I cast out before you were defiled:</p>
<p>That the terra might be defiled, and I should visit their iniquitas upon it, and the terra itself vomiteth out her inhabitants.</p>
<p>Ye shall therefore keep my statuta, and my iudicia, and shall not commit any of these abominations; neither any of your own nativi, nor any stranger that sojourneth among you:</p>
<p>(For all these abominations have the homines of the terra done, which were before you, and the terra is defiled;)</p>
<p>That the terra spue not you out also, when ye defile it, as it spued out the gentes that were before you.</p>
<p>For whosoever shall commit any of these abominations, even the animae that commit them shall be exterminata from among their populus.</p>
<p>Therefore shall ye keep mine ordination, that ye commit not any one of these abominable custumes, which were committed before you, and that ye defile not yourselves therein: I am the Dominus your Deus.</p>
