                    <p>And Joshua rose early in the matutine, and they removed from Shittim, and came to Jordan, he and all the filii of Israel, and lodged there before they passed over.</p>
<p>And it came to pass after tres dies, that the officers went through the castrum,</p>
<p>And they commanded the populus, saying, When ye see the ark of the covenant of the Dominus your Deus, and the sacerdotes and the Levites bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go after it.</p>
<p>Yet there shall be a spatium between you and it, about duo milia cubits by mensura: come not near unto it, that ye may know the way by which ye must go: for ye have not passed this way heretofore.</p>
<p>And Joshua said unto the populus, Sanctify yourselves: for tomorrow the Dominus will do wonders among you.</p>
<p>And Joshua spake unto the sacerdotes, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the populus. And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the populus.</p>
<p>And the Dominus said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee.</p>
<p>And thou shalt command the sacerdotes that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye come to the extremum of the aquae of Jordan, ye shall stand still in Jordan.</p>
<p>And Joshua said unto the filii of Israel, Come hither, and hear the words of the Dominus your Deus.</p>
<p>And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the Deus vivus is among you, and that he will without fail expellere the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Hivite, and the Perizzite, and the Girgashite, and the Jebusite, and the Amorite from before you.</p>
<p>Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Dominus of all the terra passeth over before you into Jordan.</p>
<p>Now therefore take you twelve viri out of the tribes of Israel, out of every tribe a man.</p>
<p>And it shall come to pass, as soon as the sacerdotes that bear the ark of the covenant of the Dominus shall set their pedes in the aquae of Jordan, that the aquae of Jordan shall be cut off from the aquae that come down from above; and they shall stand in uno aggregato.</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when the populus removed from their tabernacula, to pass over Jordan, and the sacerdotes bearing the ark of the covenant before the populus;</p>
<p>And as they that bore the ark were come unto Jordan, and the pedes of the sacerdotes that bore the ark were dipped in the extremum of the aquae, (for Jordan overfloweth all his ripae all the dies of the messis,)</p>
<p>That the aquae which came down from above stood and rose up upon uno aggregato very far from the civitas Adam, that is beside Zarethan: and those that came down toward the mare of the plain, even the Salt mare, failed, and were cut off: and the populus passed over right against Jericho.</p>
<p>And the sacerdotes that bore the ark of the covenant of the Dominus stood firm on dry terra in the midst of Jordan, and all the Israelites passed over on dry terra, until all the populus were passed clean over Jordan.</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when all the populus were clean passed over Jordan, that the Dominus spake unto Joshua, saying,</p>
