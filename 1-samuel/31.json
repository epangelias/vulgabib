  "Now the Philistines fought against Israel, and the Israelites fled before them, and many fell slain, sicut occiduntur, on mount Gilboa.",
  "And the Philistines pursued Saul, et filii ejus, and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua, the sons of Saul.",
  "And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers, sagittarii, hit him; and he was sore wounded of the archers.",
  "Then said Saul unto his armourbearer, Scutiger meus, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these incircumcised uncircumcisi come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.",
  "And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, et mortuus est, he fell likewise upon his sword, and died with him.",
  "So Saul died, et filii ejus, and his armourbearer, and all his men, that same day together.",
  "And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the valley, et qui erant trans vallem, and they that were on the other side Jordan, vallis Iordanis, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, et fugerunt, and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.",
  "And it came to pass on the morrow, postridie, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, ut spoliarent caesa, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa.",
  "And they cut off his head, et decollaverunt caput eius, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, in omnem regionem Philisthinorum, to carry tidings unto their idols, idola, and to the people.",
  "And they put his armour in the house of Ashtaroth, domus Astharoth, and they fastened his body to the wall of Bethshan, murus Bethsan.",
  "And when the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead, habitatores Iabes Galaad, heard of that which the Philistines had done to Saul, they arose, surrexerunt, all the valiant men, et viri fortissimi, and went all night, et per noctem, and took the body of Saul, et corpus Saul, and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Bethshan, muri Bethsan, and came to Jabesh, et venerunt in Iabes, and burnt them there.",
  "And they took their bones, et ossa eorum, and buried them under a tree at Jabesh, sub arbore in Iabes, and fasted seven days, et ieiunaverunt septem dies."
