  "Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of dominio, and a carnem, and sacred vas, and the mundi sanctified with haemorrhagia and other sacrificia.",
  "For a tabernacle was prepared, the first, wherein was the candelabrum, and the mensa, and the propositiones panum, which is called the Sanctum.",
  "And after the second velum, the tabernacle which is called the Sanctum Sanctorum;",
  "Having a golden censer, and the arca of the conventio, covered about on every side with aureum, wherein was the urna aurea having the manna, and the virga of Aaron that budded, and the tabulae of the conventio;",
  "And over it the cherubim of gloria, shadowing the propitiatorium; of which we cannot now speak particularly.",
  "Now when these things were thus ordained, the sacerdotes went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the officia of sacrificia;",
  "But into the second, the pontifex alone, once every annum, not without sanguinem, which he offered for himself, and for the erreurs of the people;",
  "The Holy Spirit this signifying, that the way of sancti was not yet manifest, while the first tabernacle was yet standing;",
  "Which was a figura for the time then present, in which were offered both dona and sacrificia, that could not make him that did the officium perfect, as pertaining to the conscientia;",
  "Only in cibis, and potibus, and divers washings, and carnem impositionibus, imposed on them until the time of reformation;",
  "But Christ being come, pontifex of the futura bona, by the maior tabernacle, and not made with manus, that is to say, not of this creatura;",
  "Neither by the sanguinem of goat and calf, but by his own sanguinem, entered in once into the Sanctum, having obtained redemption aeternam;",
  "For if the sanguinem of goat and calf, and the ashes of a heifer, sprinkling the pollutum, sanctifieth to the purificatio of the carnis;",
  "How much more shall the sanguinem of Christ, who through the Spirit aeternum, offered himself without spot to Deus, purge your conscientiam from dead operibus to serve the Deus vivum;",
  "And for this causa, he is the mediator of the Novi Testamenti, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressiones that were under the Primi Testamenti, they which are called might receive the promise of aeternae hereditatis;",
  "For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator;",
  "For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth;",
  "Whereupon neither the Primum Testamentum was dedicated without sanguinem;",
  "For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people, according to the lex, he took the sanguinem of calves and goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people;",
  "Saying, This is the sanguinem of the conventio, which Deus hath enjoined unto you;",
  "Moreover he sprinkled with sanguinem both the tabernacle, and all the vas of the ministerium;",
  "And almost all things are by the lex purged with sanguinem; and without shedding of sanguinem is no remissio;",
  "It was therefore necessary that the figures of things in the caelis should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrificia than these;",
  "For Christ is not entered into the Sanctum sanctorum, made with manus, that is to say, not of this creatura;",
  "But into heaven itself, now to appear in the face of Deus for us;",
  "Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the pontifex entereth into the Sanctum every annum with sanguinem of others;",
  "For then must he often have suffered since the fundamento of the mundi: but now once in the consummation of the saeculi hath he appeared to put away peccatum by the sacrificium of himself;",
  "And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the iudicium;",
  "So Christ was once offered to bear the peccata of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without peccatum unto salvation."
