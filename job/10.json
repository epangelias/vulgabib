  "My soul is weary of my vita, I will leave my complaint upon hymnus. I will say unto Deus, Do not condemn me, shew me wherefore thou contendest with me.",
  "Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppressio, and labour of manus tue, and shine upon consilium malum?",
  "Thine oculus are upon me, and there is none that can deliver me out of manus tue.",
  "Thy manus have made me and fashioned me together round about; yet thou dost destroy me.",
  "Remember, I pray thee, that my vita is ventus, and mine oculus shall no more see bona.",
  "The oculus of him that seeth me shall see me no more; thine oculus shall be upon me, and I shall not be.",
  "And now I shall sleep in pulvis; and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I shall not be.",
  "Why then hast thou brought me forth out of uterus, that I might see laborem and sorrow, and that my dies might consume with sorrow?",
  "Is my strength as the strength of lapides? or is my carne of brasium?",
  "Have not thou made me of nihili, and from nihili thou shalt bring me to nihili again.",
  "Thou hast granted me vita and favour, and thy providentia hath preserved my spirit.",
  "And these things hast thou hid in corde tuo; I know that this is with thee.",
  "If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from iniquitas.",
  "If I be wicked, woe unto me; and if I be just, I will not lift up my caput, I am full of confusion; therefore see thou my afflictio;",
  "For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a leo, and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me.",
  "Thou renewest thy testimonia against me, and increasest thy indignatio upon me; changes and war are against me.",
  "Why is light given to him that is in miseria, and vita unto the bitter in animus?",
  "Which wait for mortem, but it cometh not; and search for it more than for thesaurus;",
  "Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find sepulchrum.",
  "Why is light given to a homo, whose via is hid, and whom Deus hath hedged in?",
  "For my dies are consumed in fumus, and my ossa are burned with caloris.",
  "My carne is black upon me, and my skin is shrunk with caloris.",
  "My dies are swifter than a cursor, they flee away, they see no bona.",
  "They are passed away as a navis that passeth through the aqua, as when a aquila swoopeth upon sua praeda.",
  "If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my sorrow, and comfort myself;",
  "I am afraid of all my dolores, I know not what thou wilt do with me.",
  "Thou wilt not give me over unto manus iniqui, and put me not into the manus of the impie."
