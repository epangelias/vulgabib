                    <p>Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the gratia of Deus, which hath been given in the ecclesias of Macedonia;</p>
<p>How that in a great trial of affliction the abundantia of their joy and their deep paupertas abounded unto the riches of their liberalitas.</p>
<p>For to their potentia, I bear record, yea, and beyond their potentia they were voluntarii;</p>
<p>Beseeching us with much instantia that we would receive the donum, and take upon us the communicatio of the ministerium to the sancti:</p>
<p>And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Dominus, and unto us by the voluntas of Deus.</p>
<p>Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also completere in you this gratia also.</p>
<p>Therefore, as ye abound in fide, and in sermone, and in scientia, and in omni sollicitudo, and in your dilectio to us, see that ye abound in this gratia also.</p>
<p>I speak not by mandatum, but by the sollicitudo of others, and to prove the sinceritas of your dilectio.</p>
<p>For ye know the gratia of our Dominus Iesus Christus, that, though he was dives, yet for your causa he became pauper, that ye through his paupertas might be divites.</p>
<p>And herein I give my sententia: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be voluntarii a year ago;</p>
<p>Now therefore completere it in the facto also; that as there was a promptitudo to will, so of your habundantia.</p>
<p>For if there be first a voluntas, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.</p>
<p>For I mean not that other men be eased, and ye burdened:</p>
<p>But by equalitas, that now at this time your abundantia may be a supplementum of their indigentia, that their abundantia also may be a supplementum of your indigentia, that there may be equalitas:</p>
<p>As it is written, He that had gathered much had nothing over; and he that had gathered little had no lack.</p>
<p>But thanks be to Deus, which put the same sollicitudo in the cor of Titus for you.</p>
<p>For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more fervent, of his own voluntas he went unto you.</p>
<p>And we have sent with him the frater, whose laus is in the Evangelium throughout all the ecclesias;</p>
<p>And not that only, but who was also chosen of the ecclesias to travel with us with this gratia, which is administered by us to the laus of the Dominus, and willingnesse of your promptitudo:</p>
<p>Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundancia which is administered by us:</p>
<p>Providing for honestas, not only before the Domini, but also before men.</p>
<p>And we have sent with them our frater, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great fiducia which I have in you.</p>
<p>Whether any do enquire of Titus, he is my companion and fellow labourer concerning you: or our brethren be enquired of, they are the messengers of the ecclesias, and the gloria of Christus.</p>
<p>Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the ecclesias, the proof of your dilectio, and of our gloriatio of you.</p>
<p>For as touching the ministerium to the sancti, it is superfluous for me to write to you:</p>
<p>For I know the promptitudo of your animus, for which I glory of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zelus hath provoked very many.</p>
<p>Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our glorying of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready:</p>
<p>Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confidentia.</p>
<p>Therefore I thought it necessarium to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up before your benevolentia, which ye had promised, that it may be ready, as a benevolentia, and not as of covetousness.</p>
<p>Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fructus of your righteousnes;</p>
<p>Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to Deus.</p>
<p>For the administratio of this service not only supplieth the wants of the sancti, but is abundant also by many thanksgiving unto Deus;</p>
<p>Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify Deus for your subiectio to the Evangelium of Christ, and for your liberal distribution unto them, and unto all men;</p>
<p>And in their prayer for you, which long after you for the excellent gratia of Deus in you.</p>
<p>Thanks be to Deus for his donum, his inenarrabilis donum.</p>
