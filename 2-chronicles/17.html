                    <p>And Jehoshaphat his filius reigned in his loco, and strengthened himself against Israel.</p>
<p>And he placed exercitus in all the munitio urbes of Judah, and set garrisones in the terra of Judah, and in the civitates of Ephraim, which Asa his pater had taken.</p>
<p>And Dominus was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the viae of David his pater in the initio, and sought not ad Baalim;</p>
<p>But sought to Dominus Deum of his patres, and walked in his mandata, and not after the peccata of Israel.</p>
<p>And Dominus established regnum in his manus, and all Judah dedit munera to Jehoshaphat, and he had divitiae and gloria in abundantia.</p>
<p>And his cor was exalted in the viae of Dominus, and he took away the excelsa and the luci of Baal out of Judah.</p>
<p>Also in the tertius annus of his regnum, he sent his principes, Benhail, and Obadiah, and Zechariah, and Nethaneel, and Michaiah, to docere in the civitates of Judah;</p>
<p>And with them the Levites, Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tobadonijah, Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, sacerdotes.</p>
<p>And they taught in Judah, and had the libro legis Domini with them, and went about throughout all the civitates of Judah, and taught the populum.</p>
<p>And the terror Domini was upon all regna terrae round about Judah, so that they moved not contra Jehoshaphat.</p>
<p>And of the Philisthim they brought Jehoshaphaph munera, and argentum, and aurum; and the Arabes brought him capras, and ovium, and camelos in abundantia.</p>
<p>And Jehoshaphat went up with a cor magnus, and made the exercitus in Jerusalem, and the numerus of them were trecenta milia of the domus of Judah, and ducenta octoginta milia of the domus of Benjamin, qui portabant scutum et jaculum.</p>
<p>And next to him was Amasiah filius Zichri, qui se obtulit voluntarie ad Dominum, and with him ducenta milia of the domus of Judah, and valentes viri;</p>
<p>And of Benjamin, Eliada, a valens vir, and with him ducenta milia, qui portabant arcum, et scutum;</p>
<p>And next to him was Jehozabad, and with him centum octoginta milia of the exercitus, qui portabant scutum, and jaculum;</p>
<p>These waited on the regem, beside those whom the rex had placed in the munitio urbes throughout all Judah.</p>
