                    <p>And Moses spake unto the principes of the tribes concerning the filii of Israel, saying, This is the verbum which the Lord hath commanded.</p>
<p>If a virgo make a votum to the Lord, or bind herself by a iuramentum, to be bound by a iuramentum, and her pater hear her vow, and her iuramentum wherewith she hath bound her anima, and her pater shall hold his pacem at her: then all her vota shall stand, and every iuramentum wherewith she hath bound her anima shall stand.</p>
<p>But if her pater disallow her in the dies when he heareth; not any of her vota, or of her iuramenta wherewith she hath bound her anima, shall stand: and the Lord shall forgive her, because her pater disallowed her.</p>
<p>And if she had a vir to whom she were desponsata, and her vow, or the iuramentum of her lips wherewith she hath bound her anima, hath gone out; and her vir hear it, and hold his pacem at her in the dies that he heareth it: then her vota shall stand, and her iuramenta wherewith she hath bound her anima shall stand.</p>
<p>But if her vir disallow her in the dies that he heareth it; then he shall make her votum which she vowed, and the iuramentum of her lips, wherewith she bound her anima, of none effect: and the Lord shall forgive her.</p>
<p>But every vow of a vidua, or of her that is repudiata, wherewith she hath bound her anima, shall stand against her.</p>
<p>And if she vowed in the domus of her vir, or bound herself by a iuramentum, and her vir heard it, and held his pacem at her, and disallowed her not: then all her vota shall stand, and every iuramentum wherewith she hath bound her anima shall stand.</p>
<p>But if her vir disallowed her on the same dies that he heard it; then he shall make that which she vowed, and the iuramentum of her lips, wherewith she bound her anima, of none effect: and the Lord shall forgive her.</p>
<p>Every vow, and every iuramentum wherewith she hath bound her anima, shall be confirmed of her: and every iuramentum which she hath bound her anima shall stand against her.</p>
<p>But if her vir altogether hold his pacem at her from dies to dies; then he establisheth all her vota, or all her iuramenta which are upon her: he confirmeth them, because he held his pacem at her in the dies that he heard them.</p>
<p>But if he shall in any wayes make them null and void after that he hath heard them; then he shall bear her iniquitas.</p>
<p>These are the statuta which the Lord commanded Moses, between a vir and his uxor, between the pater and his filia, being yet in her iuventus in her pater's domus.</p>
