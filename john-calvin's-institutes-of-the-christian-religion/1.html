                    <p>Nearly all the wisdom we possess, theologica, is composed of two parts, the knowledge of God and the knowledge of ourselves. But, while it is joined by many bonds, which one precedes, and brings forth, the other is a matter of no small importance.</p>
<p>For, in the order of intellectual knowledge, the cognition of God, divina, takes precedence, for, in the knowledge of Him, we come to know ourselves, as from a mirror, speculo.</p>
<p>Again, it is certain that man never achieves a clear knowledge of himself, nisi, unless he has first looked upon God's face, and then descends from contemplating Him to scrutinize himself.</p>
