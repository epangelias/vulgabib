  "Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of Deus may have free course, and be glorified, even as it is with you:",
  "And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all men have not fides.",
  "But the Lord is fidelis, who shall stablish you, and keep you from malum.",
  "And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do and will do the things which we command you.",
  "And the Lord direct your cordia into the caritas of God, and into the patientia of Christ.",
  "For our brethren's sake, we had written unto you briefly, to work with your own manus, as we commanded you;",
  "That ye be not disorderly, and that ye do business, and work with your own manus, as we also commanded you;",
  "That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and that ye may have need of nothing.",
  "But we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;",
  "And to esteem them very highly in amor for their work's sake. And be at pax among yourselves.",
  "Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the fainthearted, support the weak, be patient toward all men.",
  "See that none render malum for malum unto any man; but ever follow that which is bonum, both among yourselves and to all men.",
  "Rejoice evermore, pray without ceasing, in omnibus gratias agite, this is the voluntas of Deus in Christ Jesus concerning you.",
  "Quench not the Spirit, despise not propheticum, prove all things; hold fast that which is bonum.",
  "Abstain from all form of malum, and the Deus of pax, that is, the Deus of sanitas, sanctify you wholly; and I pray Deus your whole spirit and anima and corpus be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.",
  "Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it, to the finis, to the day of Jesus Christ;",
  "To the brethren in Christ, with the pax and gratia of Deus our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.",
  "Grace be unto you, and pax, from Deus our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
