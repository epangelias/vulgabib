  "1 But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the anathema: and the indignatio of the LORD was kindled against the sons of Israel.",
  "2 And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Bethaven, on the east side of Bethel, and spake unto them, saying, Go up and explore the terra, and they went up and explored Ai.",
  "3 And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai; and make not all the people to labour thither; for they are but few.",
  "4 So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men, and they fled before the men of Ai.",
  "5 And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men: for they chased them from before the porta of the city even unto Shebarim, and smote them in the descensus: and the cor of the people was melted, and became as aqua.",
  "6 And Joshua rent his vestes, and fell to the terra upon his facies before the arca of the LORD until the evening, he and the seniores of Israel, and put dust upon their caput.",
  "7 And Joshua said, Alas, O Domine Deus, wherefore hast thou made this people to pass over Jordan, to deliver us into the manus of the Amorites, to destroy us? would to God we had been content, and dwelt on the other side Jordan!",
  "8 O Domine, what shall I say, when Israel turneth their tergum before their inimici?",
  "9 For the Canaanites and all the habitatores of the terra shall hear of it, and shall environ us round, and cut off our nomen from the terra: and what wilt thou do unto thy great nomen?",
  "10 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Surge, why liest thou thus upon thy facies?",
  "11 Israel hath peccatum, and they have also transgressed my pactum which I commanded them: for they have even taken of the anathema, and have stolen, and dissembled also, and put it even amongst their supellex.",
  "12 Therefore the filii Israel could not stand before their inimici, but turned their tergum before their inimici: because they were accursed: for I will not be with you any more, except ye destroy the anathema from among you.",
  "13 Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow: for thus saith the Domine Deus of Israel, There is an anathema in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not stand before thine inimici, until ye take away the anathema from among you.",
  "14 In the matutinum therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribus: and it shall be, that the tribus which the LORD taketh shall come according to the cognationes thereof; and the cognatio which the LORD shall take shall come according to the familia thereof; and the familia which the LORD shall take shall come according to the men thereof;",
  "15 And he that is taken with the anathema shall be burned with ignis, he and all that he hath: because he hath transgressed the pactum of the LORD, and because he hath wrought nefas in Israel.",
  "16 So Joshua rose up early in the matutinum, and brought Israel by their tribus; and the tribus of Judah was taken:",
  "17 And he brought the cognationes of Judah, and took the familia of the Zarhites: and he brought the familia of the Zarhites man by man, and Zabdi was taken:",
  "18 And he brought his familia man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.",
  "19 And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, gloria to the Domine Deus of Israel, and make confession unto him; and tell me now what thou hast done; hide it not from me.",
  "20 And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have peccatum against the Domine Deus of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:",
  "21 When I saw among the spoilia a goodly Babylonish mantle, and two hundred shekels of argent, and a tongue of aurum of fifty shekels, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the terra in the midst of my tabernaculum, and the argent under it.",
  "22 So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tabernaculum; and, behold, it was hid in his tabernaculum, and the argent under it.",
  "23 And they took them out of the midst of the tabernaculum, and brought them unto Joshua, and unto all the filii Israel, and laid them out before the Domine.",
  "24 Then Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the argent, and the mantle, and the tongue of aurum, and his filii, and his filiae, and his bubus, and his asinus, and his oves, and his tabernaculum, and all that he had:",
  "25 And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? the Domine shall trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with lapides, and he was combustus with ignis, after they had lapidated him with lapides.",
  "26 And they raised over him a great tumulus of lapides unto this day. So the Domine turned from the ferocious ira. Wherefore the nomen of that place was called, The valle of Achor, unto this day."
