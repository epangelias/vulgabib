  "If there be among you a pauper of one of thy fratres within any of thy portae in thy terra, which Iehova thy Deus giveth thee, thou shalt not harden thy cor against thy pauper, but thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him, and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his necessitas, in that which he wanteth.",
  "Beware that there be not a cogitatio wicked in thy cor, saying, The septimus anni, the anni of remissio, is at hand; and thine oculus be evil against thy pauper, and thou givest him nothing; lest he cry against thee unto Iehova, and it be sin unto thee.",

  "Then thou shalt take an awl, and thrust it through his auris unto the ostium, and he shall be thy servus for ever: and also unto thy ancilla thou shalt do likewise.",
  "It shall not seem hard unto thee, when thou sendest him away free from thee; for he hath been worth a double hired servus to thee, in serving thee six anni: and Iehova thy Deus shall bless thee in all that thou doest.",
