  "And as Jesus passed by, He saw a man which was blind from his nativitas, who sat and begged.",
  "And His disciples asked Him, saying, Rabbi, quis peccavit, this man, or his parentes, that he was born caecus?",
  "Jesus answered, Neither hath this man peccavit, nor his parentes: but that the opera of God should be manifest in him.",
  "I must work the opera of Him that sent me, while it is dies: for when nox is come, no man can operari.",
  "As long as I am in the mundus, I am the lux mundi.",
  "When He had thus spoken, He spat on the terra, and made clay of the spittle, and He anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,",
  "And said unto him, Vade, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretatio, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.",
  "The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was caecus, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?",
  "Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I am he.",
  "Therefore said they unto him, Quomodo were thine eyes opened?",
  "He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Vade, wash in the pool of Siloam: and I went and washed, and received visus.",
  "Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.",
  "They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.",
  "And it was sabbatum when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.",
  "Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his visus. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do video.",
  "Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbatum. Others said, How can a man that is peccator do such signa? And there was a divisio among them.",
  "They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a propheta.",
  "The Iudaei did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his visus, until they called the parentes of him that had received his visus.",
  "And they asked them, saying, Is this your filius, who ye say was born caecus? how then doth he now see?",
  "His parentes answered them and said, We know that this is our filius, and that he was born caecus:",
  "But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.",
  "These words spake his parentes, because they feared the Iudaei: for the Iudaei had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christus, he should be put out of the synagoga.",
  "Therefore said his parentes, He is of age; ask him.",
  "Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the gloriam: we know that this man is a peccator.",
  "He answered and said, Whether he be a peccator or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was caecus, now I see.",
  "Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?",
  "He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his discipuli?",
  "Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his discipulus; but we are Moysis discipuli.",
  "We know that God spake unto Moysis: as for this fellow, we know not from whence he is.",
  "The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a mirabilis thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes.",
  "Now we know that God heareth not peccatores: but if any man be a cultor of God, and doth voluntas ejus, him he heareth.",
  "Since the mundus began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born caecus.",
  "If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.",
  "They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in peccatis, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.",
  "Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Believest thou in the Filium Dei?",
  "He answered and said, Who is he, Domine, that I might believe in him?",
  "And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.",
  "And he said, Domine, I believe. And he worshipped him.",
  "And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this mundus, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made caeci.",
  "And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also?",
  "Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no peccatum: but now ye say, We see; therefore your peccatum remaineth."
