                    <p>The universe is mental, held in the mind of THE ALL.</p>
<p>THE ALL is Spirit, unbound, unconditioned, infinite, and eternal.</p>
<p> Spirit is the essence of THE ALL, the vital force, the fountain head of all life, energy, and manifestation.</p>
<p>THE ALL is the infinite, the eternal, the uncreated, the unconditioned, the boundless, and the unknowable.</p>
<p>In its essence, THE ALL is unchangeable, immovable, and unmanifest.</p>
<p>But, in its manifestation, THE ALL is the cause of all causes, the source of all sources, the fountain of all life, energy, and manifestation.</p>
<p>THE ALL is the infinite, the eternal, the uncreated, the unconditioned, the boundless, and the unknowable.</p>
<p>In its essence, THE ALL is unchangeable, immovable, and unmanifest.</p>
