                    <p>1. Now Moses kept the flocks of Jethro his father in law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of Dei, to Horeb.</p>
<p>2. And the angelus of the Lord appeared unto him in a flamma of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.</p>
<p>3. And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great spectaculum, why the bush is not burnt.</p>
<p>4. And when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses: and he said, Here am I.</p>
<p>5. And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy caligas from thy pedes, for the locus whereon thou standest is terra sancta.</p>
<p>6. Moreover he said, I am the Deus of thy pater, the Deus of Abraham, the Deus of Isaac, and the Deus of Jacob. And Moses hid his facies; for he was timorized to look upon Deum.</p>
<p>7. And the Lord said, I have surely seen the afflictio of my populus which are in Aegyptus, and have heard their clamor because of their exactores: for I know their dolor.</p>
<p>8. And I am come down to deliver them out of the manūs of the Aegyptii, and to bring them up out of that terra unto a terra bona et lata, unto a terra fluenta lactis et melis; unto the locus of the Chanaanite, and the Hethite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.</p>
<p>9. Now therefore, behold, the clamor of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the manūs wherewith the Aegyptii oppress them.</p>
<p>10. Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaon, that thou mayest bring forth my populus the children of Israel out of Aegyptus.</p>
<p>11. And Moses said unto Deus, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaon, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Aegyptus?</p>
<p>12. And he said, Certē I will be with thee; and this shall be a sign unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth the populus out of Aegyptus, ye shall serve Deus upon this mountain.</p>
<p>13. And Moses said unto Deus, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The Deus of your patres hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his nomen? what shall I say unto them?</p>
<p>14. And Deus said unto Moses, I Am Qui Sum: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I Am hath sent me unto you.</p>
<p>15. And Deus said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, the Deus of your patres, the Deus of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my nomen for ever, and this is my memoria unto all generations.</p>
<p>16. Go, and gather the ancianos of Israel together, and say unto them, The Deus of your patres, the Deus of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, Visiting I have visited you, and seeing I have seen that which is done to you in Aegyptus:</p>
<p>17. And I have said, I will bring you up out of the afflictio of Aegyptus unto the terra of the Chanaanite, and the Hethite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, unto a terra fluenta lactis et melis.</p>
<p>18. And they shall hearken to thy vox; and thou shalt come, thou and the ancianos of Israel, unto the king of Aegyptus, and ye shall say unto him, The Deus of the Hebraei hath met with us: and now let us go, we beseech thee, three dies' journey into the desert, that we may sacrifice unto the Deus of our patres.</p>
<p>19. And I know that the king of Aegyptus will not let you go, but by a manus robusta.</p>
<p>20. And I will stretch out my manus, and smite Aegyptus with all my miracles which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go.</p>
<p>21. And I will give this populus favour in the sight of the Aegyptii: and it shall be, when ye go, ye shall not go empty.</p>
<p>22. But every mater shall borrow of her companion, and of her that sojourneth in her domus, vessels of argentum, and vessels of aurum, and raiment: and ye shall put them upon your filii, and upon your filiae; and ye shall spoil the Aegyptii.</p>
<p>23. And Moses said, Behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my vox: for they will say, The Deus hath not appeared unto thee.</p>
<p>24. And the Lord said unto him, What is that in thy manus? And he said, A virga.</p>
<p>25. And he said, Cast it on the terra. And he cast it on the terra, and it became a serpens; and Moses fled from before it.</p>
<p>26. And the Lord said unto Moses, Put forth thine manus, and take it by the cauda. And he put forth his manus, and caught it, and it became a virga in his manus:</p>
<p>27. That they may believe that the Deus of their patres, the Deus of Abraham, the Deus of Isaac, and the Deus of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee.</p>
<p>28. And the Lord said furthermore unto him, Put now thy manus into thy sinum. And he put his manus into his sinum: and when he took it out, behold, his manus was as if lepra had smitten it; it was as white as nix.</p>
<p>29. And he said, Put thy manus into thy sinum again. And he put his manus into his sinum again; and plucked it out of his sinum, and, behold, it was restored again as his other flesh.</p>
<p>30. And it shall be, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the vox of the first sign, that they will believe the vox of the latter sign.</p>
<p>31. And it shall be, if they will not believe also these two signa, neither hearken unto thy vox, that thou shalt take of the aqua of the flumen, and pour it upon the terra: and the aqua which thou takest out of the flumen shall become sanguis upon the terra.</p>
<p>32. And Moses said unto the Lord, O my Lord, I am not eloquens, neither heri, nor yesterday, neither since thou hast spoken unto thy servus: but I am slow of loquela, and of a tardus lingua.</p>
<p>33. And the Lord said unto him, Who hath made man's os? or who maketh the mutus, or the audiens, or the videntes, or the caeci? have not I the Deus?</p>
<p>34. Now therefore go, and I will be with thy os, and teach thee what thou shalt say.</p>
<p>35. And he said, O my Lord, send, I beseech thee, by the manus of him whom thou wilt send.</p>
<p>36. And the indignatio of the Lord was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is not Aaron the Levite thy frater? I know that he can loqui well. And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in corde.</p>
<p>37. And thou shalt speak unto him, and put vox in his os: and he shall be thy prolocutor unto the populus: and he shall be, even he shall be to thee instead of os, and thou shalt be to him instead of Deus.</p>
<p>38. And thou shalt take this virga in thy manus, wherewith thou shalt do signa.</p>
<p>39. And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my fratres which are in Aegyptus, and see whether they be yet vivi. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in pace.</p>
<p>40. And the Lord said unto Aaron, Go into the desert to meet Moses. And he went, and met him in the mountain of Deus, and kissed him.</p>
<p>41. And Moses told Aaron all the words of the Lord who had sent him, and all the signa which he had commanded him.</p>
<p>42. And Aaron spake all the words which the Lord had spoken unto Moses, and did the signa in the sight of the populus.</p>
<p>43. And the populus believed: and when they heard that the Lord had visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their afflictio, they bowed their heads and adoraverunt.</p>
