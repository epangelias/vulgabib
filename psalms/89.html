                    <p>I will sing of the mercies naturae of the Lord for ever: with my mouth will I make known thy fidelitas to all generations.</p>
<p>For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever: thy veritas shalt thou establish in the coelum.</p>
<p>I have made a covenant with my electus, I have sworn unto David my servus.</p>
<p>Thy semen will I establish for ever, and build up thy thronus to all generations.</p>
<p>And the coelum shall praise thy mirabilia, O Lord: thy fidelitas also in the congregation of the sancti.</p>
<p>For who in the coelum can be compared unto the Lord? who among the filii Dei can be likened unto the Lord?</p>
<p>God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the sancti, and to be had in reverence of all them that are about him.</p>
<p>O Lord God of the exercitus, who is a strong Lord like unto thee? or to thy fidelitas round about thee?</p>
<p>Thou rulest the pride of the maris: when the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them.</p>
<p>Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; thou hast scattered thine enemies with thy brachium.</p>
<p>The coelum are thine, the terra also is thine: thou hast founded the orbem terrarum, and all that therein is.</p>
<p>Thou hast created the Aquilon, and the Meridiem: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy nomine.</p>
<p>Thou hast a potent brachium: strong is thy manus, and high is thy dextera.</p>
<p>Iustitia and iudicium are the habitation of thy thronus: misericordia and veritas shall go before thy facies.</p>
<p>Blessed is the people that know the iubilatio: they shall walk in the luce of thy facies, O Lord.</p>
<p>They shall rejoice in thy nomine all the die: in thy iustitia shall they be exalted.</p>
<p>For thou art the gloria of their potentia: and in thy beneplacito shall our cornu be exalted.</p>
<p>For the Lord is our protector, and the Holy One of Israel is our Rex.</p>
<p>Then thou spakest in a vision to thy sanctus, and saidst, I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people.</p>
<p>I have found David my servus; with my sancto oleo have I anointed him:</p>
<p>With whom my manus shall be established: mine arm also shall strengthen him.</p>
<p>The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the filius iniquitatis afflict him.</p>
<p>And I will beat down his foes before his facies, and plague them that hate him.</p>
<p>But my fidelitas and my misericordia shall be with him: and in my nomine shall his cornu be exalted.</p>
<p>I will set his manus also in the mari, and his dextera in the flumen.</p>
<p>He shall cry unto me, Thou art my Pater, my Deus, and the Rocha of my salus.</p>
<p>Also I will make him my primogenitus, higher than the reges of the terra.</p>
<p>His semen will I establish for ever, and his thronus as the dies of the coelum.</p>
<p>If his filii forsake my legem, and walk not in my iudicia;</p>
<p>If they break my statuta, and keep not my mandata:</p>
<p>Then will I visit their transgressiones with virga, and their iniquitates with flagella.</p>
<p>Nevertheless my misericordia will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my fidelitas to fail.</p>
<p>My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my labia.</p>
<p>Once have I sworn by my sanctitas, that I will not lie unto David.</p>
<p>His semen shall endure for ever, and his thronus as the sol in my presence.</p>
<p>It shall be established for ever as the lunam, and as a fidus testis in coelo.</p>
<p>But thou hast cast off and abhorred, thou hast been angry with thine Anointed.</p>
<p>Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servus: thou hast profaned his coronam by casting it to the terra.</p>
<p>Thou hast broken down all his muri: thou hast laid his munitiones in ruin.</p>
<p>All that pass by the via spoil him: he is a reproach to his neighbours.</p>
<p>Thou hast set up the dexteram of his enemies: thou hast made all his adversaries to rejoice.</p>
<p>Thou hast also turned the edge of his gladius, and hast not made him to stand in the battle.</p>
<p>Thou hast made his puritas to cease, and cast his thronus to the terra.</p>
<p>Thou hast shortened the dies of his iuventus: thou hast covered him with confusio.</p>
<p>How long, Lord? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? shall thy indignatio burn like fire?</p>
<p>Remember how short my tempus is: wherefore hast thou made all men in vanitate?</p>
<p>What man is he that liveth, and shall not see mortem? shall he deliver his anima from the manus of sepulchrum?</p>
<p>Lord, where are thy misericordiae of old, which thou swarest unto David in thy fidelitas?</p>
<p>Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servus; how I do bear in my bosom the reproach of all the potentia of the people;</p>
<p>Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O Lord; wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine Anointed.</p>
<p>Blessed be the Lord for evermore. Amen, and Amen.</p>
