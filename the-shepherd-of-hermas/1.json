  "I was a shepherd, and after I had been released from the army, I went to my country and lived a virtuous vida.",
  "I had a brother, whose name was Paul, who was in the habit of speaking to me as if he were my lord, and I loved him as I did myself, and he was faithful, and yet I was simple and innocent, and knew not the malum of the world.",
  "I remained in the field a few days, and then I came to the city, and I was taken with a great enthusiasmus to see my brother, and I went to him, and we embraced each other, and he spoke to me with a loud voice, and said, 'How was it that you were not afraid in the field, when you saw the great bestia?'",
  "I said to him, 'Because I am a Christianus, and I trust in the Lord, and He has given me power and strength, and I feared not the bestia.'",
  "He said to me, 'It is good, but now listen to me, and I will show you the things which the Lord has revealed to me.'",
  "He took me by the hand, and led me to a certain place, and showed me a great porta, and said, 'Do you see this porta?'",
  "I said, 'I see it, lord.'",
  "He said to me, 'This porta is the porta of vita, and every one who enters through it shall live.'",
  "He showed me also a certain virgo, who was seated on the porta, and said, 'Do you see this virgo?'",
  "I said, 'I see her, lord.'",
  "He said to me, 'This virgo is the accidens of the Church, and she is the spiritus of vita.'"
