                    <p>Many a time have they afflictio me from my iuuentus, saith Israel.</p>
<p>Many a time have they afflictio me from my iuuentus: yet they have not preuailed against me.</p>
<p>The agri plowers plowed upon my back: they made long sulcos.</p>
<p>But the iustus Dominus hath cut asunder the thongs of the impiorum.</p>
<p>They shall be confounded and put to shame that delight in my calamitate: they shall be turned backe and put to shame suddenly.</p>
<p>They shall be as grana that groweth on the tecta of the domus, which withereth afore it groweth vp:</p>
<p>Wherewith the messor filleth not his manum, nor the binder of sheues his gremium.</p>
<p>Neither doe they that passe by say, Benedicite in Domino, qui plantauerit, et repleuit eam.</p>
<p>Qui in domo Dominus benedicit vos: exsurgat Israel.</p>
