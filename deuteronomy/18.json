  "The LORD thy Deus shall raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken;",
  "According to all that thou desiredst of the LORD thy Deus in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again the vox of the LORD my Deus, neither let me see this great ignis any more, that I die not.",
  "And the LORD said unto me, They have well spoken that which they have spoken.",
  "I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee, and will put my verbum in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him.",
  "And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken unto my verbum which he shall speak in my nomine, I will require it of him.",
  "But the Prophet, which shall presume to speak a verbum in my nomine, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the nomine of other dei, even that Prophet shall die.",
  "And if thou say in thine cor, How shall we know the verbum which the LORD hath not spoken?",
  "When a Prophet speaketh in the nomine of the LORD, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the LORD hath not spoken, but the Prophet hath spoken it presumptuously: thou shalt not be afraid of him.",
  "When the LORD thy Deus shall cut off the gentes, whose land the LORD thy Deus giveth thee, and thou succeedest them, and dwellest in their civitates, and in their domus;",
  "Thou shalt separate three civitates for thee in the midst of thy terra, which the LORD thy Deus giveth thee to possess it.",
  "Thou shalt prepare thee a way, and divide the coasts of thy terra, which the LORD thy Deus giveth thee to inherit, into three parts, that every homicida may flee thither.",
  "And this is the causa of the lex which I command thee this day, that thou mayest vivere, and multiply, and go in and possess the terra which the LORD sware unto thy patres;",
  "That thou mayest put away the innocentum of the sanguis of the innocent from the midst of thee, when thou shalt do that which is rectum in the sight of the LORD.",
  "Thou shalt not plant thee a grove of any trees near unto the altare of the LORD thy Deus, which thou shalt make thee.",
  "Neither shalt thou set thee up any imagines of lapides in thy terra, to bow down unto them: for I am the LORD thy Deus.",
  "Thou shalt not sacrifice unto the LORD thy Deus any bullock, or sheep, wherein is blemish, or any evilfavouredness: for that is an abomination unto the LORD thy Deus.",
  "If there be found among you, within any of thy portae which the LORD thy Deus giveth thee, man or woman, that hath wrought wickedness in the sight of the LORD thy Deus, in transgressing his pactum;",
  "And hath gone and served other dei, and worshipped them, either the sol, or lunam, or any of the caelestia, which I have not commanded;",
  "And it be told thee, and thou hast heard of it, and inquired diligently, and, behold, it be true, and the thing certain, that such abomination is wrought in Israel;",
  "Then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman, which have committed that wicked thing, unto thy portae, even that man or that woman, and shalt stone them with lapides, till they die.",
  "At the mouth of two testes, or three testes, shall he that is worthy of death be put to death; but at the mouth of one testis he shall not be put to death.",
  "The hand of the testes shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterward the hand of all the people. So thou shalt put the malum away from among you."
