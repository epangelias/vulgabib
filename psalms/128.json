  "Blessed is every one that feareth the Dominus, that walketh in his viae.",
  "For thou shalt eat the labores of thy manus: happy shalt thou be, and it shall be bene with thee.",
  "Thy uxor shall be as a vitis flourishing in the latera of thy domus: thy filii like olivae, fruentes in circuitu of thy mensa.",
  "Behold, that thus shall the homo be blessed, that timet the Dominus.",
  "The Dominus bless thee out of Sion, and thou shalt see the bonum of Hierusalem all the dies of thy vita.",
  "Yea, thou shalt see thy filii, and thy filiorum filii, and pacem upon Israel."
