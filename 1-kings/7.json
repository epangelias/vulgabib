  "Then Solomon built a templum to the LORD in Jerusalem, on Mount Moriah, where the LORD appeared unto David his father, in the place that David had prepared in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.",
  "And he began to build in the second month, in the fourth year of his reign, in the month Zif.",
  "And the house which King Solomon built for the LORD, the length thereof was sixty cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits.",
  "And the porch before the templum of the house, twenty cubits was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house.",
  "And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.",
  "And against the wall of the house he built a atrium, round about, against the walls of the house round about, against the wall of the house and the wall of the vestibulum, and he made chambrum in the atrium.",
  "The door posts, and the architrave, and the walls round about, and the windows to the atrium round about, he overlaid with aurum.",
  "And the floor of the atrium he overlaid with aurum, within the vestibulum and without, and the thresholds, and the door posts, and the walls thereof, and the windows, overlaid with aurum, and on the walls cherubim made of palm trees.",
  "And he made a porta of the vestibulum for the entrance of the templum, and overlaid it with aurum, and there was a porta round about.",
  "And in the porta of the vestibulum were gravings of palm trees, and a florilegium of flowers: and he overlaid them with aurum.",
  "And the porta and the thresholds, and the rebatements, and the door posts thereof overlaid he with aurum; and cherubim and palm trees made he on the walls.",
  "And also he made for the door of the vestibulum porta posts of aholz, and overlaid them with aurum, and he made hinges of aurum for them.",
  "And the porta he made in the porta of the vestibulum, right against the porta of the templum, and overlaid it with aurum, and on the walls thereof made he gravings.",
  "And he made in the porta of the vestibulum two porta posts of aholz, and overlaid them with aurum, and twelve lions of aurum were on the porta posts, three on the one side, and three on the other side: there was not made the like of it in any regio.",
  "And Hiram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basons. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made King Solomon for the house of the LORD:",
  "The two pillars, and the vasa of the capitals which were on the top of the two pillars; and the two reticulums to cover the two vasa of the capitals which were on top of the pillars;",
  "And four hundred pomegranates for the two reticulums, even two rows of pomegranates for one reticulums, to cover the two vasa of the capitals which were upon the pillars.",
  "He made also bases, and lavers made he upon the bases;",
  "One sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;",
  "And the pots, and the shovels, and the basons: and all these vessels, which Hiram made to King Solomon for the house of the LORD, were of bright brass.",
  "In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredatha.",
  "Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for the weight of the brass could not be found out.",
  "And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of the LORD: the altar of aurum, and the table of aurum, whereupon the shewbread was;",
  "And the candelabra of pure aurum, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the oraculum, with the flowers, and the candelabra, and the mortaria of aurum;",
  "And the hocks, and the censers, and the basons, and the mortaria, and the spoons, and the firepans, all these vessels made he of aurum.",
  "And the entrance of the templum with aurum, and the golden altar, and the tables of aurum, whereupon the shewbread was set;",
  "And the five candelabra of beaten aurum, with their flower, and their mortaria, and their censers, and the spoons, and the firepans, all these vessels made he of aurum.",
  "And the doors of the templum were made of aurum; and the door posts also and the architrave thereof were overlaid with aurum; and so for the porta of the vestibulum.",
  "And the pillars for the porta of the vestibulum were of aholz, overlaid with aurum; and their door posts and their hinges overlaid he with aurum.",
  "Thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the LORD was finished: and Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated; even the argentum and the aurum, and the vessels, and put them among the treasures of the house of the LORD.",
  "Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto King Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion.",
  "And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto King Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.",
  "And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.",
  "And they brought up the ark of the LORD, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle, those did the priests and the Levites bring up.",
  "And King Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude.",
  "And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto his place, into the oraculum of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim.",
  "For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and the staves thereof above.",
  "And they drew out the staves of the ark, that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy place before the oraculum; but they were not seen without. And there it is unto this day.",
  "There was nothing in the ark save the two tabulae of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a foedus with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Aegypt.",
  "And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the nubes filled the house of the LORD;",
  "So that the priests could not stand to minister because of the nubes: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of the LORD.",
  "Then spake Solomon, The LORD said that he would dwell in the caligo.",
  "I have surely built thee an house to dwell in, a settled place for thee to abide in for ever.",
  "And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the congregation of Israel: and all the congregation of Israel stood;",
  "And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which spake with his mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hand fulfilled it, saying,"
