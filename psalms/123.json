  "Blessed is he that considereth the pauperes, the Dominus shall deliver him in the time of tribulatio.",
  "The Dominus shall preserve him, and keep him alive, and he shall be blessed upon the terra, and thou shalt not deliver him unto the voluntas of his enemies.",
  "The Dominus shall strengthen him upon the lectus of languor, thou shalt turn all his stratum in his infirmitas.",
  "I said, Dominus, have misericordia on me, heal my anima, for I have peccatum against thee.",
  "Mine inimici speak malum of me, When shall he die, and his nomen perish?",
  "And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanitas, his cor gathereth iniquitas to himself, and when he goeth abroad, he speaketh of it.",
  "All that hate me whisper together against me, against me do they devise iniquitas.",
  "An iniquitas is come out against me, and they have devised malum against me, how long shall I suffer from them?",
  "Deliver me, O Dominus, from the manus of the inimicus, from the palmis of the odiosus and violentus.",
  "My spes, O Dominus, is in thee, deliver me from all persecutores, and behold me.",
  "Blessed be the Dominus, for he hath not given us for a praedam to their dentibus.",
  "Our anima is escaped as the avis out of the laqueus of the venatores, the laqueus is broken, and we are escaped.",
  "Our adjutor is in the nomine of the Dominus, who made caelum and terram."
