                    <p>O give thanks unto Domino, call upon his nomen; make known his acta among the people.</p>
<p>Sing unto him, sing psalmos unto him; talk ye of all his wondrous opera.</p>
<p>Glory ye in his sanctum nomen; let the heart of them rejoice that seek Domino.</p>
<p>Seek the Domine, and his fortitudo; seek his facies evermore.</p>
<p>Remember his mirabilia, quae fecit; his prodigia, and the judicia of his ore.</p>
<p>O seed of Abraham his servus, ye children of Jacob his electi:</p>
<p>He is Dominus Deus noster; his judicia are in terra.</p>
<p>He hath remembered his foedus sempiternum, the verbum quod mandavit in mille generationes.</p>
<p>Quod pepigit with Abraham, et suo juramento to Isaac;</p>
<p>And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a lex, and to Israel for sempiternum pactum:</p>
<p>Saying, To thee will I give terra Chanaan, the portion of your haereditas:</p>
<p>When they were but a few homines; yea, very few, and strangers in it.</p>
<p>When they went from gens ad gentem, from regnum ad regnum:</p>
<p>He suffered non hominem to do them wrong; yea, he reproved reges for their causa.</p>
<p>Touch not mine uncti, and do my prophetis no malum.</p>
<p>Fecit potestatem in terra; he turned the flumen into siccitas, to make a via to the multitudinem:</p>
<p>And turned the torrentem into flumen, and the fontes aquarum into siccitas.</p>
<p>He turned the flumen into siccitas, that they might through the deserta, to give them potestatem super gentes:</p>
<p>And he increased his populus, and strengthened him with potentia.</p>
<p>Their animus was brought down with labor and mala; and cum angustia.</p>
<p>He sent his verbum, and sanavit eos, et erudivit eos ab eorum interfectionibus.</p>
<p>Mirabilis fecit inter eos signa, in terra Aegypti, in campo Taneos.</p>
<p>He divided mare, and led eos per medium; and statuit aquas ut agger.</p>
<p>And he led eos per nubes nocte, et in luce ignis tota nocte.</p>
<p>He clave petram in deserto, and gave eos potum quasi de abyssus multae aquae.</p>
<p>He opened petrae in deserto, and gave eos eximium potum, quasi de abyssus multae aquae.</p>
<p>He clave petram, and the flumina fluxerunt; he led eos per deserta, quasi per terram aquis deducendis.</p>
