                    <p>And God blessed Noah and his filii, saying, Be fruitfulis, and multiplicare, and replenish the terra.</p>
<p>And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every bestia of the terra, and upon every avis of the heavens, upon all that moveth upon the terra, and upon all the pisces of the mari: into your manus are they delivered.</p>
<p>Every movens thing that viveth shall be meat for you; even as holera, or herba, I have given you all things.</p>
<p>But the sanguis of you I will require; at the manus of every bestia will I require it, and at the manus of man; at the manus of every frater will I require the anima of man.</p>
<p>Whoso sheddeth man's sanguis, by man shall his sanguis be shed: for in the imaginem of God made he hominem.</p>
<p>And you, be fruitfulis, and multiplicare; bring forth abundanter in the terra, and multiplicare therein.</p>
<p>And God spake unto Noah, and to his filii with him, saying,</p>
<p>And I, behold, I establish my foedus with you, and with your seminis after you;</p>
<p>And with every living creatura that is with you, of the avis, of the pecora, and of every bestia of the terra with you; from all that goeth out of the arca, to all bestia of the terra.</p>
<p>And I will establish my foedus with you; neither shall all caro be cut off any more by the aquae of a diluvium; neither shall there any more be a diluvium to destroy the terra.</p>
<p>And God said, This is the sign of the foedus which I make between me and you and every anima that is with you, for perpetuas generationes:</p>
<p>I do set my arcus in the nubes, and it shall be for a sign of the foedus between me and the terra.</p>
<p>And it shall come to pass, when I bring a nubes over the terra, that the arcus shall be seen in the nubes:</p>
<p>And I will remember my foedus, which is between me and you and every anima of all caro; and the aquae shall no more become a diluvium to destroy all caro.</p>
<p>And the arcus shall be in the nubes; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the foedus perpetuum between God and every anima of all caro that is upon the terra.</p>
<p>And God said unto Noah, This is the sign of the foedus, which I have established between me and all caro that is upon the terra.</p>
<p>And the filii of Noah, that went forth of the arca, were Sem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the pater of Chanaan.</p>
<p>These are the three filii of Noah: and of them was the whole terra overspread.</p>
<p>And Noah began to be a cultivator of the terra, and he planted a vinea:</p>
<p>And he drank of the vinum, and was ebrius; and he was uncoveredis in his tabernaculum.</p>
<p>And Ham, the pater of Chanaan, saw the nuditas of his pater, and told his two fratres without.</p>
<p>And Sem and Japheth took a vestimentum, and laid it upon both their umeros, and went backward, and covered the nuditas of their pater; and their facies were backward, and they saw not their pater's nuditas.</p>
<p>And Noah awoke from his vinum, and knew what his filius minor had done unto him.</p>
<p>And he said, Cursed be Chanaan; a servus of servos shall he be unto his fratres.</p>
<p>And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of Sem; and Chanaan shall be his servus.</p>
<p>God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tabernaculis of Sem; and Chanaan shall be his servus.</p>
<p>And Noah lived after the diluvium three hundred and fifty years.</p>
<p>And all the dies of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.</p>
