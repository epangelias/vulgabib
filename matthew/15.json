  "Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, qui erant de Ierusalem, saying,",
  "Why do thy disciples transgredire the tradition of the ancients?",
  "For they lavent manus suas, when they manducare bread.",
  "And he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgredire the mandatum of God by your traditio?",
  "For Deus dixit, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that maledicet patri aut matri, moriatur.",
  "But ye say, Whosoever shall dixisse to his father or his mother, It is a donum, whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;",
  "And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye made the mandatum of God of none effect by your traditio.",
  "Hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,",
  "This people draweth nigh unto me with ore, but their cor is far from me.",
  "Teaching for doctrines the mandata of homines, and the traditio of the ancients.",
  "And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and intelligite:",
  "Not that which ingreditur in os, commaculat hominem; but that which procedit ex ore, hoc commaculat hominem.",
  "Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisee, qui audierunt the word, were scandalizati?",
  "But he answered and said, Every plantatum, which my caelum non planted, shall be eradicated.",
  "Let them alone: they are caeci ductores of caecis. And if caecus caecum ducat, ambo in foveam cadent.",
  "Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parabolam.",
  "And Jesus said, Are ye also yet sine intellectu?",
  "Do not ye yet intelligere, that omne, which ingreditur in os, in ventrem vadit, and is egestum in latrinam?",
  "But those things which procedunt ex ore, ab corde procedunt, and eae commaculant hominem.",
  "For from corde procedunt, cogitationes malae, caedes, adulteria, fornicationes, furta, falsa testimonia, blasphemiae:",
  "These are the things which commaculant hominem: but to manducare with unwashed manus, non commaculat hominem.",
  "Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the regiones of Tyri et Sidonis.",
  "And, behold, a mulier Cananea of the same regiones came out, and cried unto him, saying, Have misericordiam on me, O Domine, filius David; my filia is grievously vexed with a daemonium.",
  "But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.",
  "But he answered and said, I am not missus nisi to the ovibus, qui perierunt of the domus of Israel.",
  "Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Domine, adiuva me.",
  "But he answered and said, It is not bonum to take the panem of the filii, and to cast it to the catelli.",
  "But she said, Yea, Domine: for the catelli also eat of the micis, which fall from the mensa of their domini.",
  "Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O mulier, great is thy fides: be it done unto thee as thou wilt. And her filia was sana from that hora.",
  "And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the mare of Galilea, and going up into a montem, he sat down there.",
  "And great multitudes came unto him, having with them clotidi, and mute, and caeci, and mancos, and many others, and cast them down at his pedes; and he healed them:",
  "Insomuch that the multitudes wondered, when they saw the mute speaking, the clotidi sane, the caeci videntes, and the mancos ambulantes, and they glorificabant Deum of Israel.",
  "Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have misericordiam on the multitudinem, because they continue with me now tres dies, and have nothing to manducare: and I will not dimittre them jejunos, lest they faint in the via.",
  "And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have panem in the deserto to satiare so great a multitudinem?",
  "And Jesus saith unto them, How many panes have ye? And they said, Septem, and a few pisciculi.",
  "And he commanded the multitudinem to sit down on the terra.",
  "And he took the septem panes and the pisciculi, and gratias agens, broke, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitudinem.",
  "And they did all manducare, and were satiati: and they took up septem sportas full of the reliquiae.",
  "And they that did manducare were quattuor milia hominum, beside mulieres and pueri.",
  "And he sent away the barcam, and ascended into montem solus to orare. And when the vespera was come, he was there solus.",
  "But the barca was now in the medio of the mari, tossed with the fluctus: for the ventus was contrarius.",
  "And in the quarta vigilia of the noctis, Jesus venit ad eos, ambulans super mare.",
  "And when the disciples saw him ambulare super mare, they were turbati, saying, It is a phantasma; and they clamabant from timore.",
  "But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Habete fiduciam; ego sum, ne timueritis.",
  "And Peter answered him and said, Domine, si tu es, jube me venire ad te super aquas.",
  "And he said, Veni. And when Peter descended from the barca, he walked super aquas, to venire to Jesus.",
  "But seeing the ventum vehementem, he was timuit: and as he began to mergi, he clamavit, saying, Domine, salva me.",
  "And immediately Jesus stretched forth his manum, and took hold of him, and said unto him, O thou of little fides, why didst thou dubitare?",
  "And when they were ascended into the barca, the ventus cessavit.",
  "Then they that were in the barca came and worshipped him, saying, Vere tu es Filius Dei.",
  "And when they were ascended into the terra, they came into the regionem of Genezareth.",
  "And when the homines of that place had cognitum him, they sent into all that regionem, and brought unto him all that were languidi,",
  "And besought him that they might only tetigere the orlo of his vestimentum: and as many as tetigerunt him were sana."
