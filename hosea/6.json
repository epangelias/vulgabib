  "When Israel was a child, then I amavit him, and called my filius out of Aegyptum.",
  "As they called them, so they went from them: they sacrificaverunt unto Baalim, and burned incense to graven imagines.",
  "Therefore have I writtus to him, the viae of the Domini: he shall convert me, and I will multiplicare his messis, and make my medicina to florere.",
  "I will be to him a pastor, and he shall ambulare post me: I will convert his populus, and he shall multiplicare his messis.",
  "I will bring him back, and he shall habiter in his tabernaculum, and he shall florere as the rosae, and he shall odorare as the Libanus.",
  "His radices shall extend to mare, and his rami shall florere to flumen.",
  "Ephraim shall dicere, What have I to do any more with idola? I will respondere, and lo, I will florere as the cupressus: my fructus shall be from me.",
  "Who is sapiens, and he shall intelligere these? prudent, and he shall cognoscere them? for the viae of the Domini are rectae, and the iusti shall ambulare in eis: but the transgressores shall offendere in eis."
