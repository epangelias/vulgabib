                    <p>Then Job answered and said, Hear, I beseech thee, O dominus meus, and hearken unto my sermo:</p>
<p>How long wilt thou speak these res, and how long shall the words of thy os be like a vehement ventus?</p>
<p>Doth Deus pervertare iudicium? or doth the Omnipotens pervertare iustitiam?</p>
<p>If filii tui have sinned against him, and he hath traduced them in the manus of their iniquitas,</p>
<p>If thou wilt seek Deus betimes, and make thy preces to the Omnipotens:</p>
<p>If thou wert purus and rectus; surely now he would awakere and make thy morbus ligia:</p>
<p>And though thy principio were small, yet thy posteritas should be abundans:</p>
<p>Enquire, I pray thee, of the aetas prioris, and prepare thyself to the investigationem of the patres:</p>
<p>Namely, whether the causae of the terra have not been manifested unto them, and the natura of the creaturas told them:</p>
<p>Behold, Deus is magnus, and we know him not, neither can the numerus of his annus be searched out:</p>
<p>For he secludeth the stellas, and covereth them with nebula sua:</p>
<p>He holdeth the aquas in his manus, and the firmamentum of the terra is his manus:</p>
<p>Behold, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not:</p>
<p>Behold, he taketh away, and who can hinder him? who will say unto him, Quid facis?</p>
<p>If Deus will not withdraw his ira, the gigantes of the infernus will be subject unto him:</p>
<p>Behold, at his faciem the terra is shaken, and at his aspectus the colles are overturned:</p>
<p>The terra is moved at the aspectus of him, and the fontes of the abyssus are opened:</p>
<p>He secludeth the lumen with the nubes sua, and the fulmen of the coelum is with him:</p>
<p>Behold, at the auditus of him the tonitrus of the coelum will be, and he will send out the fulmen of his ira:</p>
<p>And at the sonus of the tonitrus of his vox, the anima of the bestiae will flee:</p>
<p>He will send out the fulmen of his ira, and will destroy them out of their loci:</p>
<p>At the sonus of the tonitrus of his vox, the terra will be moved:</p>
<p>In his dies, the terra will be moved, and the colles will be overturned at his furor:</p>
<p>The radix of the mari will be revealed, and the fundamentum of the terra will be discovered:</p>
<p>He will not spare them, for he is a Deus of potestas, and he is a Deus of ira:</p>
<p>Yea, he is a Deus of misericordia, and he will not destroy them, but he will spare them:</p>
