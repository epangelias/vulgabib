                    <p>Thus all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the Lord was finished: and Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated; even the argentum and the aurum, and the vessels, and put them among the treasures of the house of the Lord.</p>
<p>Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the caput of the tribus, the principes of the patres of the children of Israel, unto king Solomon in Hierusalem, that they might bring up the arca foederis of the Lord out of the civitas David, which is Zion.</p>
<p>And all the congregation of Israel offered sacrificium before the arca, and the sacerdotes bare the arca.</p>
<p>And they brought up the arca, and the tabernaculum foederis, and all the sanctuarium vessels that were in the tabernaculum, these did the sacerdotes and the Levites bring up.</p>
<p>And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto him, were with him before the arca, sacrificing pecora and boves, which could not be told nor numbered for multitude.</p>
<p>And the sacerdotes brought in the arca foederis of the Lord unto his locum, into the oraculum of the templum, to the sanctum sanctorum, under the alas of the cherubim.</p>
<p>For the cherubim spread forth their alas over the locum of the arca, and the cherubim covered the arca and the staves thereof above.</p>
<p>And they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were seen out in the sanctum before the oraculum, and they were not seen without: and there they are unto this day.</p>
<p>There was nothing in the arca save the duas tabulae, which Moses put there at Horeb, when the Lord made a foedus with the filii Israel, when they came out of Aegyptum.</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when the sacerdotes were come out of the sanctum, that the nubes filled the templum of the Lord,</p>
<p>So that the sacerdotes could not stand to minister because of the nubes: for the gloria Domini had filled the templum of the Lord.</p>
<p>Then spake Solomon, The Lord said that he would dwell in the caligo.</p>
<p>I have surely built thee an domus to dwell in, a sedes for thee to rest in for ever.</p>
<p>And the king turned his facies about, and blessed all the congregation of Israel: (and all the congregation of Israel stood;)</p>
<p>And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, who spake with his os unto David my pater, and with his manus hath fulfilled it, saying,</p>
<p>Since the die I brought forth my populus Israel out of Aegyptum, I chose no civitas out of all the tribus of Israel to build an domus, that my nomen might be therein; but I chose David to be over my populus Israel.</p>
<p>And it was in the cor of David my pater to build an domus for the nomen of the Lord God of Israel.</p>
<p>And the Lord said unto David my pater, Whereas it was in thy cor to build an domus for my nomen, thou didst well that it was in thy cor.</p>
<p>Nevertheless thou shalt not build the domus; but thy filius that shall come forth out of thy lumbus, he shall build the domus for my nomen.</p>
<p>The Lord therefore hath performed his sermonem that he spake: and I am risen up in the locum of David my pater, and sit on the solium of Israel, as the Lord promised, and have built an domus for the nomen of the Lord God of Israel.</p>
<p>And I have set there a locum for the arca, wherein is the foedus of the Lord, which he made with our patres, when he brought them out of the terra Aegypti.</p>
<p>And Solomon stood before the altar of the Lord in the sight of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his manus toward caelum:</p>
<p>And he said, Lord God of Israel, there is no Deus like thee in caelum above, or on terra beneath, who keepest pactum and misericordia with thy servus, that walketh before thee with totum cor:</p>
<p>Who hast kept with thy servus David my pater that thou promisedst him: thou spakest also with thy os, and hast fulfilled it with thy manus, as it is this die.</p>
<p>Now therefore, O Lord God of Israel, keep with thy servus David my pater that thou promisedst him, saying, There shall not fail thee a vir before me to sit on the solium of Israel; so that thy filii take heed to their via, that they walk before me as thou hast walked before me.</p>
<p>And now, O God of Israel, let thy sermonem, I pray thee, be verified, which thou spakest unto thy servus David my pater.</p>
<p>But will God indeed dwell on terra? behold, the caelum and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this domus that I have builded?</p>
<p>Yet have thou respect unto the oratio of thy servus, and to his precatio, O Lord my Deus, to hearken unto the clamor and the oratio, which thy servus prayeth before thee to die:</p>
<p>That thine oculi may be open toward this domus night and day, even toward the locum of which thou hast said, My nomen shall be there: that thou mayest hearken unto the oratio which thy servus shall make toward this locum.</p>
<p>And hearken thou to the precationem of thy servus, and of thy populus Israel, when they shall pray toward this locum: yea, hear thou in caelum thy dwelling locum: and when thou hearest, forgive.</p>
<p>If any man trespass against his proximus, and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before thy altar in this domus:</p>
<p>Then hear thou in caelum, and do, and judge thy servos, condemning the impium, and bringing his via upon his caput; and justifying the justum, and giving him according to his justitia.</p>
<p>When thy populus Israel be smitten down before the inimicus, because they have sinned against thee, and shall turn again to thee, and confess thy nomen, and make precationem, and orationem unto thee in this domus:</p>
<p>Then hear thou in caelum, and forgive the peccatum of thy populus Israel, and bring them again unto the terra which thou gavest unto their patres.</p>
<p>When caelum is shut up, and there is no imber, because they have sinned against thee: if they pray toward this locum, and confess thy nomen, and turn from their peccata, when thou afflictest them:</p>
<p>Then hear thou in caelum, and forgive the peccatum of thy servos, and of thy populus Israel, that thou teach them the bona via wherein they should walk, and give imber upon thy terra, which thou hast given to thy populus for hereditas.</p>
<p>If there be in terra famis, if there be pestilentia, blasting, mildew, locusta; if there be caterpillar; if their inimicus besiege them in the terra of their civitates; whatsoever plaga, whatsoever sickness there be;</p>
<p>Whatsoever oratio and whatsoever precatio be made by any man, or by all thy populus Israel, when every one shall know the affliction of his own cor, and spread forth his manus toward this domus:</p>
<p>Then hear thou in caelum thy dwelling locum, and forgive, and do, and give every man according to his vias, whose cor thou knowest; (for thou, even thou only, knowest the cor of all the filii Adam;)</p>
<p>That they may fear thee all the dies which they live in the terra which thou gavest unto our patres.</p>
<p>Moreover concerning a stranger, that is not of thy populus Israel, but cometh out of a terra far off for thy nomen's sake;</p>
<p>(For they shall hear of thy grande nomen, and of thy manus potens, and of thy brachium extentum;) when he shall come and pray toward this domus;</p>
<p>Hear thou in caelum thy dwelling locum, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for: that all populi of the terra may know thy nomen, to fear thee, as doth thy populus Israel; and that they may know that this domus, which I have builded, is called by thy nomen.</p>
<p>If thy populus go out to battle against their inimicus, whithersoever thou shalt send them, and shall pray unto the Lord toward the civitas which thou hast chosen, and toward the domus that I have built for thy nomen:</p>
<p>Then hear thou in caelum their oratio and their precatio, and maintain their causam.</p>
<p>If they sin against thee, (for there is no homo that sinneth not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the inimicus, so that they carry them away captivi unto the terra of the inimicus, far or near;</p>
<p>Yet if they shall bethink themselves in the terra whither they were carried captivi, and turn and pray unto thee in the terra of their captivitas, saying, We have sinned, we have done wickedly, we have dealt impie;</p>
<p>If they return to thee with all their cor, and with all their animus, in the terra of their inimicus, who led them away captivi, and pray unto thee toward their terra, which thou gavest unto their patres, the civitas which thou hast chosen, and the domus which I have built for thy nomen:</p>
<p>Then hear thou their oratio and their precationem in the caelum thy dwelling locum, and maintain their causam, and forgive thy populus, that have sinned against thee.</p>
<p>Now, my Deus, let, I beseech thee, thine oculi be open, and let thy aures be attent unto the oratio of this locum.</p>
<p>And now arise, O Lord Deus, into thy resting locum, thou, and the arca of thy potentia: let thy sacerdotes, O Lord Deus, be clothed with salvation, and let thy sancti rejoice in bona.</p>
<p>O Lord Deus, turn not away the facies of thine unction: remember the misericordia of thy servus David.</p>
