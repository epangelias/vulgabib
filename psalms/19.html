                    <p>The heavens declare the gloria Dei; and the firmament sheweth his handywork.</p>
<p>Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth scientia.</p>
<p>There is no speech nor language, where their vox is not heard.</p>
<p>Their linea is gone out through all the terra, and their words to the end of the mundus. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sol.</p>
<p>Which is as a sponsus coming out of his thalamus, and rejoiceth as a fortis to run a cursus.</p>
<p>His going forth is from the extremity of coelum, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the calor thereof.</p>
<p>The lex of the Domini is perfect, converting the anima: the testimonium of the Domini is sure, making sapient the simplex.</p>
<p>The statuta of the Domini are recta, rejoicing the cor: the mandatum of the Domini is lucidum, illuminating the oculus.</p>
<p>The timor of the Domini is purus, remaining for ever: the judicia of the Domini are vera, and justa.</p>
<p>More to be desired are they than aurum, yea, than much fine aurum: sweeter also than mel, and the honeycomb.</p>
<p>Moreover by them is thy servus monitus: and in keeping of them there is magna retributio.</p>
<p>Who can understand his errores? Purge me from occultis, Domine.</p>
<p>Keep back thy servum also from superbias: let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be perfect, and I shall be innocent from the magna transgressio.</p>
<p>Let the words of my os, and the meditation of my cor, be acceptable in thy sight, Domine, my fortitudo, and my redemptor.</p>
