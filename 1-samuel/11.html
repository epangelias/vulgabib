                    <p>Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabeshgilead: and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash, Make a foedus with us, and we will servire you.</p>
<p>And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this condition will I make a foedus with you, that I may enucleare all your oculi, and lay it for a reproach upon all Israel.</p>
<p>And the elders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us septem dies respite, that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of Israel: and then, if there be no one to salvare us, we will exitus out to you.</p>
<p>Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the tidings in the aures of the populus: and all the populus lifted up their voces, and wept.</p>
<p>And, behold, Saul came after the boves out of the ager, and said, What ails the populus that they weep? And they told him the tidings of the viri of Jabesh.</p>
<p>And the Spirit of Deus was upon Saul, when he heard those tidings, and his ira was kindled greatly.</p>
<p>And he took a iugum of boves, and hewed them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the coasts of Israel by the manu of messengers, saying, Whosoever comes not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done unto his boves. And the timor Domini fell on the populus, and they came out as one homo.</p>
<p>And when he numbered them in Bezek, the filii of Israel were trecenti milia, and the viri of Judah triginta milia.</p>
<p>And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall you say unto the viri of Jabeshgilead, Tomorrow, by the time the sol is hot, you shall have salvus. And the messengers came and told the viri of Jabesh; and they were laeti.</p>
<p>So the viri of Jabesh said, Tomorrow we will exitus out unto you, and you shall do with us all the voluntas in your oculi.</p>
<p>And it was so on the die crastinus, that Saul put the populus in tres manus, and they came into the castrum in the morning watch, and slew the Ammonites until the calor of the sol: and it came to pass, that they who remained were dispersi, so that two of them were not left together.</p>
<p>And the populus said unto Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall Saul reign over us? bring the viri, that we may mortificare them.</p>
<p>And Saul said, There shall not be mortificatio this die, for today the Dominus has operatus salvus in Israel.</p>
<p>Then said Samuel to the populus, Come, and let us ire to Gilgal, and renovare there the regnum.</p>
<p>And all the populus went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul rex before the Dominus in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed sacrificia pacifici before the Dominus; and there Saul and all the viri of Israel were laeti.</p>
