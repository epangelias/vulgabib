  "After two days was the passover, and of the festum azymorum, and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by cum dolo, and put him to mors.",
  "And being in Bethania with the twelve, as they sat at mensa, there came a mulier, having an alabastrum of unguentum, and she brake the alabastrum, and poured it on his caput.",
  "There were quidam who said among themselves, Why was this unguentum wasted?",
  "For it might have been vendere for more than trecentos denarii, and have been given to the pauperes. And they murmured against her.",
  "But Jesus said, Sinite eam. Why do you molestat her? She hath wrought a bonum opus upon me.",
  "For ye have the pauperes with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them bonum. But me ye have not semper.",
  "She hath done what she could: she is come beforehand to unguere my corpus for the sepultura.",
  "Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this evangelium shall be preached throughout the mundus, this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memoria of her.",
  "And Judas Iscariot, one of the duodecim, went unto the chief priests, to tradere him unto them.",
  "And when they heard it, they were gaudens, and promised to give him pecuniam. And he quaerebat how he might tradere him opportunely.",
  "And the first dies of the festum azymorum, when they killed the pascha, his discipuli say unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to edere the pascha?",
  "And he sendeth forth two of his discipuli, and saith unto them, Go ye into the civitas, and there shall meet you a homo, bearing a lagena of aqua: follow him.",
  "And wheresoever he shall introire, say ye to the dominus of the domus, The magister saith, Where is the coena, where I shall edere the pascha with my discipulis?",
  "And he will shew you a coenaculum, grande, furnished, and prepared: there make ready for us.",
  "And his discipuli went forth, and came into the civitas, and found as he had dixit unto them: and they prepared the pascha.",
  "And when the hora was come, he sat down, and the duodecim apostoli with him.",
  "And he said unto them, With desiderium I have desidered to edere this pascha with you before I patior:",
  "For I say unto you, I will not edere thereof, until it be fulfilled in the regnum of Deus.",
  "And he took the calix, and gave gratias, and said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves:",
  "For I say unto you, I will not bibere of the fructus of the vine, until the regnum of Deus shall come.",
  "And he took panem, and gave gratias, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, This is my corpus which is given for you: this do in memoria of me.",
  "Likewise also the calix after coenam, saying, This calix is the novum testamentum in my sanguine, which is fundere for you.",
  "But behold, the manus of him that tradeth me is with me on the mensa.",
  "And that the Filius of Homo goeth, as it is scriptum of him: but woe to that homo by whom the Filius of Homo is traditus! bonum were for him if that homo had never been natus.",
  "And they began to inquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing.",
  "And there was also a contentio among them, which of them should be reputed the maior.",
  "And he said unto them, The reges of the gentes exercere dominium over them; and they that exercere potestatem upon them are called benefactores.",
  "But ye shall not be so: but he that is maior among you, let him be as the minor; and he that is princeps, as he that servit.",
  "For whether is maior, he that sitteth at mensa, or he that servit? is not he that sitteth at mensa? but I am in medio of you as he that servit.",
  "Ye are they which have persevered with me in my temptationes.",
  "And I appoint unto you a regnum, as my Pater hath appointed unto me;",
  "That ye may edere and bibere at my mensa in my regnum, and sit on thronos, judging the duodecim tribes of Israel.",
  "And the Dominus said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satanas hath desired to have you, that he may cribrare you as triticum:",
  "But I have rogated for thee, that thy fides fail not: and thou, when thou art converted, strengthen thy fratres.",
  "And he said unto him, Domine, I am ready to go with thee, both into carcerem, and to mors.",
  "And he said, I say unto thee, Petre, the gallus shall not cantare this die, before thou shalt negare me thrice.",
  "And he said unto them, When I sent you without a bursa, and a pera, and caligas, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing.",
  "Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a bursa, let him take it, and likewise a pera; and he that hath not, sell his tunic, and buy a gladius.",
  "For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be impletus in me, And he was numbered with the malefici: for the things concerning me have an finem.",
  "And they said, Domine, behold, here are duo gladii. And he said unto them, It is sufficient.",
  "And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the montem of Olives; and his discipuli also followed him.",
  "And when he was at the locus, he said unto them, Orate, ne intretis in temptationem.",
  "And he was withdrawn from them about a lapidem's cast, and he flexed his genua, and orabat,",
  "Saying, Pater, if thou wilt, remove this calix from me: nevertheless not my voluntas, but thine be done.",
  "And there appeared to him an angel from caelum, strengthening him.",
  "And being in an agonia, he orabat more intente: and his sudor was as guttae sanguinis, descending upon the terram.",
  "And when he rose up from oratione, and was come to his discipuli, he found them dormientes for sorrow,",
  "And said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and orate, ne intretis in temptationem.",
  "And while he yet spake, behold a turba, and he that was called Judas, one of the duodecim, went before them, and drew near unto Jesus to osculari him.",
  "But Jesus said unto him, Judas, per osculum tradis Filius of Homo? when they which were about him saw what would follow, they said unto him, Domine, shall we strike with gladio?",
  "And one of them smote the servus of the pontifex, and cut off his aurem dexter.",
  "And Jesus answered, Sinite, thus far. And he touched his aurem, and healed him.",
  "Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the templum, and the senioribus, who were come to him, Are ye come out, as against a latro, with gladiis and fustibus?",
  "When I was daily with you in the templum, ye stretched forth no manus against me: but this is your hora, and the potestas of tenebrae.",
  "Then took they him, and led him, and brought him to the domus of the pontifex. And Petrus followed afar off.",
  "And when they had kindled a ignis in the medio of the hall, and were set down together, Petrus sat down among them.",
  "But a certain ancilla, seeing him as he sat by the ignis, and earnestly looking at him, said, This homo was also with him.",
  "And he denied him, saying, Mulier, I know him not.",
  "And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of them. And Petrus said, Homo, I am not.",
  "And about the hora of gallicinium, another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a veritate this homo was also with him: for he is a Galilaeus.",
  "And Petrus said, Homo, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the gallus cantavit.",
  "And the Dominus turned, and looked upon Petrus. And Petrus remembered the verbum of the Dominus, how he had said unto him, Before the gallus cantabit, thou shalt negare me thrice.",
  "And Petrus went out, and flevit amare.",
  "And the homines who held Jesus, deridebant him, and covered his faciem, and colaphis eum ceciderunt, and said unto him, Prophetiza, who is it that smote thee?",
  "And many other contumeliae they spake against him.",
  "And as soon as it was die, the senioribus and the chief priests and the scribae came together, and led him away to the Pilatus.",
  "And they began to accusare him, saying, We found this homo subvertens our natio, and forbidding to give tributum to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christus, a Rex.",
  "And Pilatus asked him, saying, Art thou the Rex of the Judaei? And he answered him, and said, Thou sayest it.",
  "Then Pilatus said unto the chief priests and the multitudinem, I find no causa in this homo.",
  "And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the populum, docens throughout all Judaea, beginning from Galilaea to this locus.",
  "When Pilatus heard of Galilaea, he asked whether the homo were a Galilaeus.",
  "And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herodis potestas, he sent him to Herodem, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.",
  "And when Herodes saw Jesus, he was exceeding gaudens, for he was desiderous to see him of a long time, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to see some miraculum done by him.",
  "Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.",
  "And the chief priests and the scribae stood and vehemently accusabant him.",
  "And Herodes with his exercitus, and the officers of the chief priests, despised him, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a white vestis, and sent him again to Pilatus.",
  "And the same die Pilatus and Herodes were made amici unto this die: for before they were enemies between themselves.",
  "And Pilatus, when he had called together the chief priests, and the rulers, and the populum,",
  "Said unto them, Ye have brought this homo unto me, as one that perverteth the populum: and, behold, I, having examinatus him before you, have found no causa in this homo touching those things whereof ye accusast him:",
  "No, nor yet Herodes: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of mors is done unto him.",
  "I will therefore chastise him, and release him.",
  "For of necessity he must release one unto them at the festum.",
  "And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this homo, and release unto us Barabbam:",
  "(Who for a sedition made in the civitas, and for homicidium, was cast into carcerem.)",
  "Pilatus therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them.",
  "But they cried, saying, Crucifige, crucifige him.",
  "And he said unto them the third time, Why, what malum hath this homo done? I have found no causa of mors in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him go.",
  "And they were instant with loud voces, requiring that he might be crucifed. And the voces of them and of the chief priests prevailed.",
  "And Pilatus gave sentence that it should be as they required.",
  "And he released unto them him that for sedition and homicidium was cast into carcerem, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their voluntas.",
  "And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon a Cyrenaeus, who coming from the ager, and on whom they laid the crux, that he might bear it after Jesus.",
  "And there followed him a great multitude of populus, and of mulieres, who also bewailed and lamented him.",
  "But Jesus turning unto them said, Filiae of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your liberi.",
  "For, behold, the dies are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed are the steriles, and the ventres that never bare, and the pectora which never lactaverunt.",
  "Then shall they begin to say to the montes, Fall on us; and to the colles, Cover us.",
  "For if they do these things in a green lignum, what shall be done in the aridum?",
  "And there were also two malefici, led with him to be put to mors.",
  "And when they were come to the locus, which is called Calvaria, there they crucifed him, and the malefici, one on the dexter manus, and the other on the sinister.",
  "And Jesus said, Pater, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his vestimenta, and cast lots.",
  "And the populus stood beholding. And the rulers also with them deridebant him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christus, the electus of Deus.",
  "And the milites also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him acetum,",
  "And saying, If thou be the Rex of the Judaei, save thyself.",
  "And a superscriptio was also written over him in litteris Graecis, and Latinis, and Hebraicis, THIS IS THE REX OF THE JUDAEI.",
  "And one of the malefici which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christus, save thyself and us.",
  "But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear Deus, seeing thou art in the same damnation?",
  "And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our acta: but this homo hath done nothing perniciosum.",
  "And he said unto Jesus, Domine, memento mei, when thou comest in thy regnum.",
  "And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To die shall not be the finis of thee, but thou shalt be with me in paradisus to die.",
  "And it was about the hora sexta, and there was a tenebrae over all the terra, until the hora nona.",
  "And the sol was darkened, and the velum of the templum was rent in the medio.",
  "And when Jesus had cried with a loud vox, he said, Pater, in manus tuas commendo spiritum meum: and having said thus, he expired.",
  "Now when the centurio saw what was done, he glorified Deus, saying, Certainly this homo was justus.",
  "And all the multitude that came together to that spectaculum, and saw the things which were done, smote their pectora, and returned.",
  "And all his noti, and the mulieres that followed him from Galilaea, stood afar off, beholding these things.",
  "And, behold, there was a homo named Joseph, a senator, who also himself waited for the regnum of Deus;",
  "He was not consentiens to the consilium and acta of them; he was of Arimathaea, a civitas of the Judaei: who also himself waited for the regnum of Deus.",
  "This homo went unto Pilatus, and begged the corpus of Jesus.",
  "And he took it down, and wrapped it in sindon, and laid it in a monument, where never homo was yet laid.",
  "And that die was the parasceve, and the sabbatum drew on.",
  "And the mulieres also, which came with him from Galilaea, followed after, and beheld the monument, and how his corpus was laid.",
  "And they returned, and prepared aromata and unguenta; and rested the sabbatum die according to the mandatum."
