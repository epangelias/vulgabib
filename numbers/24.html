                    <p>And Balaam saw Israel abiding in his tents according to their tribus, and the Spiritus of God came upon him.</p>
<p>And he took up his parabola, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, the man whose oculus is opened hath said:</p>
<p>He hath said, which heard the verbum of God, which saw the visio of the Omnipotens, falling into a somnus, with his oculus open:</p>
<p>How goodly are thy tabernacula, O Jacob, thy tentacula, O Israel!</p>
<p>As vallis they are stretched out, as horti by the ripa of a flumen, as the tabernacula which the Dominus hath pitched, as the cedri by the ripa of a flumen.</p>
<p>He shall pour the aqua out of his olla, and his semen shall be in many aquas, and his rex shall be higher than Agag, and his regnum shall be exaltatum.</p>
<p>God brought him forth out of Aegyptum; he hath as the unicorns cornua for him: he shall eat up the gentes his enemies, and shall break their ossa, and pierce them through with his sagittae.</p>
<p>He couched, he lay down as a leo, and as a coluber; who shall stir him up? Blessed is he that blesseth thee, and cursed is he that curseth thee.</p>
<p>And Balak's ira was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his manus together: and Balak said unto Balaam, I called thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed them altogether these three times.</p>
<p>Therefore now flee thou to thy locus: I thought to promote thee unto great honorem; but, lo, the Dominus hath kept thee back from honorem.</p>
<p>And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy nuntii which thou sentest unto me, saying,</p>
<p>If Balak would give me his domus full of argentum and aurum, I cannot go beyond the verbum of the Dominus my Deus, to do less or more.</p>
<p>Now therefore, behold, I go unto my populus: come therefore, and I will admonish thee what this populus shall do to thy populus in the novissimus dies.</p>
<p>And he took up his parabola, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, the man whose oculus is opened hath said:</p>
<p>He hath said, which heard the verbum of God, and had the scientia of the Altissimus, which saw the visio of the Omnipotens, falling into a somnus, with his oculus open:</p>
<p>I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not nigh: there shall come a Stella out of Jacob, and a Scepter shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the angulus of Moab, and destroy all the filii of tumultus.</p>
<p>And when he looked on Amalech, he took up his parabola, and said, Amalech was the first among the gentes; but his novissimus state shall be that he perish for ever.</p>
<p>And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parabola, and said, Strong is thy habitatio, and thou puttest thy nidus in a petra.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted, until Asshur shall carry thee away captive.</p>
<p>And he took up his parabola, and said, Alas, who shall live when Deus doth this?</p>
<p>And there shall be a navis coming from the litus of Chittim, and shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber, and he also shall perish for ever.</p>
<p>And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his locus: and Balak also went his way.</p>
