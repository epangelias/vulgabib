                    <p>1 And the Dominus spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p>2 Command the filii Israel, and say unto them, My oblation, and my bread for my sacrifices made by fire, for a sweet odorem unto me, shall ye observe to offer unto me in their due season.</p>
<p>3 And thou shalt say unto them, This is the ignis which ye shall offer unto the Dominus; two agni of the first year without spot day by day, for a holocaustum perpetuum.</p>
<p>4 The one agnus thou shalt offer in the morning, and the other agnus thou shalt offer between the two vespers;</p>
<p>5 And a tenth part of an ephah of flour for a sacrifice, mingled with the fourth part of an hin of oil.</p>
<p>6 It is a holocaustum perpetuum, which was ordained in mount Sinai for a sweet odorem, a sacrificium made by fire unto the Dominus.</p>
<p>7 And the libation thereof shall be the fourth part of an hin unto one agnus: in the locum sanctum thou shalt cause the libation of potentissimus vinum to be poured unto the Dominus.</p>
<p>8 And the second agnus thou shalt offer between the two vespers: according to the oblation of the morning, and according to the libation thereof, thou shalt offer it an holocaustum, a sweet odorem unto the Dominus.</p>
<p>9 And on the dies sabbati two agni of the first year without spot, and two tenth deals of flour for a sacrifice, mingled with oil, and the libation thereof:</p>
<p>10 This is the holocaustum of every dies sabbati, beside the perpetual holocaustum, and his libation.</p>
<p>11 And in the calends of your menses ye shall offer a holocaustum unto the Dominus, two young bucoli, and one aries of the greges:</p>
<p>12 And three tenth deals of flour for a sacrifice, mingled with oil, for one buculus;</p>
<p>13 And two tenth deals of flour for a sacrifice, mingled with oil, for one aries;</p>
<p>14 And one tenth deal of flour for a sacrifice, mingled with oil, for one agnus: it is a holocaustum of a sweet odorem, a sacrificium made by fire unto the Dominus.</p>
<p>15 And their libation shall be the fifth part of an hin of vinum unto the buculus, and the third part of an hin unto the aries, and the fourth part of an hin unto the agnus: this is the holocaustum of every calends in your menses.</p>
<p>16 And on the fourteenth day of the first mense shall be the pascha of the Dominus.</p>
<p>17 And in the fifteenth day of this mense is the festum: seven dies shall unleavened panis be eaten.</p>
<p>18 In the first day shall be an holy convocatio; ye shall do no servile opus:</p>
<p>19 But ye shall offer a sacrificium made by fire for a holocaustum unto the Dominus; two bucoli, and one aries, and seven agni of the first year: they shall be unto you without macula.</p>
<p>20 And their oblation shall be of flour mingled with oil: three tenth deals shall ye offer for a buculus, and two tenth deals for a aries;</p>
<p>21 A tenth deal shalt thou offer for every agnus, throughout the seven agni:</p>
<p>22 And one caper hircorum for a peccatum, to make propitiation for you:</p>
<p>23 Beside the holocaustum of the morning, which is for a perpetual holocaustum, ye shall offer these.</p>
<p>24 After this manner ye shall offer daily, throughout the seven dies, the bread of the oblation made by fire of a sweet odorem unto the Dominus: it shall be offered beside the perpetual holocaustum, and his libation.</p>
<p>25 And on the seventh day ye shall have an holy convocatio; ye shall do no servile opus.</p>
<p>26 Also in the day of the primitias, when ye bring a new frumentum unto the Dominus, after your weeks be out, ye shall have an holy convocatio; ye shall do no servile opus:</p>
<p>27 But ye shall offer the holocaustum for a sweet odorem unto the Dominus; two bucoli, and one aries, and seven agni of the first year;</p>
<p>28 And their oblation of flour mingled with oil, three tenth deals unto one buculus, two tenth deals unto one aries;</p>
<p>29 A tenth deal unto one agnus, throughout the seven agni;</p>
<p>30 One caper hircorum, to make propitiation for you;</p>
<p>31 Beside the perpetual holocaustum, and the oblation thereof, ye shall offer them (they shall be unto you without macula) and their libation.</p>
