  "Against Egypt, concerning the army of Pharaoh-necho king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, which Nebuchadrezzar rex Babylonis smote in the fourth year of Jehoiakim filius Josiah rex Iudah.",
  "Order ye the buckler and shield, and draw near to battle.",
  "Harness the horses; and get up, ye equites, and stand in your helmets; furbish the lance, put on the brigandines.",
  "Why have I seen it? they are terrified, they are turned backward, and their fortes are broken; yea, they are fled afoot, and they did not respect their lives; for the pavor of the Lord, and the gloria of his potentia.",
  "The swift shall not flee away, neither shall the fortes escape; they shall stumble, and fall toward the aquilon; and they shall be atque exhausted.",
  "Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I will give the terra Aegypti into the hand of the destructor, and the turbatio of the gentes shall be destroyed.",
  "And I will sell the terra into the hand of cruelissimi destructores; and the terra shall be desolate, et omnia quae in ea sunt, per manus exterorum.",
  "Thus saith the Lord; Lo, I will destroy the reliquiae of the Aegyptii, and the superbias of their fortitudinem shall cease from the terra of the Nili; and they shall be destroyed by the hand of destructores.",
  "And the terra of Aegyptus shall be desolate et solitaria; and they shall know that I am the Lord, because he hath spoken, I will put a finis to the multitudo of the Nili."
