                    <p>1 Forasmuch as we know, brethren, your felicitas, and our apostolus, and the ministerium of the Evangelium of Christ, to commend you to God, and to pray your perseverantia in Christ.</p>
<p>2 But we have this treasure in vasculum, that the excellentia of the virtus may be of God, and not of us.</p>
<p>3 We are troubled on every side, yet not in angustia; perplexed, but not in desperatione;</p>
<p>4 Persecuted, but not destroyed; cast down, but not perditus;</p>
<p>5 Always bearing about in the corpus our mortificatio of the Lord Jesus, that the vita also of Jesus might be made manifest in our corpus.</p>
<p>6 For we which live are always delivered unto mortem for Jesus' sake, that the vita also of Jesus might be made manifest in our corpus.</p>
<p>7 But we have this treasure in vasculum, that the excellentia of the virtus may be of God, and not of us.</p>
<p>8 We are troubled on every side, yet not in angustia; perplexed, but not in desperatione;</p>
<p>9 Persecuted, but not destroyed; cast down, but not perditus;</p>
<p>10 Always bearing about in the corpus our mortificatio of the Lord Jesus, that the vita also of Jesus might be made manifest in our corpus.</p>
<p>11 For we which live are always delivered unto mortem for Jesus' sake, that the vita also of Jesus might be made manifest in our corpus.</p>
<p>12 So then death worketh in us, but vita in you.</p>
<p>13 But we having the same spirit of fides, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak;</p>
<p>14 Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present us with you.</p>
<p>15 For all things are for your sakes, that the abundantia of gratia might through the gratiarum actionem of many redound to the gloria of God.</p>
<p>16 For which cause we faint not; but though our exterior homo perish, yet the interior homo is renewed day by day.</p>
<p>17 For our light afflictio, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a weight of gloria far beyond comparison;</p>
<p>18 While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are aeternal.</p>
