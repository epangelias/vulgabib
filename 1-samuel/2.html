                    <p>And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in Domino, my horn is exalted in Jehova, my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation.</p>
<p>There is none holy as Jehova, for there is none beside thee: neither is there any rock like Deus noster.</p>
<p>Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancia proceed out of your mouth: for Jehova is a Deus of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.</p>
<p>The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are girt with fortitudo.</p>
<p>They that were full have hired out themselves for panis, and they that were hungry ceased: so that the barren hath born septem, and she that hath many children is waxed feeble.</p>
<p>Jehova killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to sepulchrum, and bringeth up.</p>
<p>Jehova maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up.</p>
<p>He raiseth up the poor out of pulvis, and lifteth up the beggar from dunghill, to set them among principes, and maketh them inherit the thronus of glory: for the pillars of terra are Jehova's, and he hath set the mundus upon them.</p>
<p>He will keep the pedes of his sancti, and the wicked shall be silent in tenebrae; for by fortitudo shall no man prevail.</p>
<p>The adversaries of Jehova shall be broken to pieces; out of caelum shall he thunder upon them: Jehova shall judge the ends of terra, and he shall give fortitudo to his rege, and exalt the horn of his christus.</p>
<p>And Elkanah went to Ramath his domus, and the puer Samuel ministered to Jehova before Eli sacerdos.</p>
<p>Now the filii of Eli were filii of Belial; they knew not Jehova.</p>
<p>And it was so, when any man offered sacrificium, the filii of Eli came, while the carnem was in coctura, with a furca of tres unciae in his manu;</p>
<p>And he struck it into the caldron, or pot, or pan, or olla, all that the furca could reach: thus they did in Israel unto all the people that came thither.</p>
<p>Also before they burnt the adipem, the puer minister of sacerdos came, and said to the man that sacrificabat, Give carnem to roast for the sacerdos; for he will not have sodenum of thee, but crude.</p>
<p>And if any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn adipem to die, as to die; then take as much as thy animus desireth; he would answer them, Nay; but thou shalt give it me now: and if not, I will take it by fortis manus.</p>
<p>Wherefore the sin of the filii of Eli was very grandis before Jehova; for men abhorred the sacrificium of Jehova.</p>
<p>But Samuel ministered before Jehova, being a puer, girded with a ephod linen.</p>
<p>Moreover his mater made him a parva tunic, and brought it to him from annum to annum, when she came up with her maritus to sacrificare the sacrificium annuum.</p>
<p>And Eli blessed Elkanah and his uxorem, saying, Jehova give thee semen of this mulier, for the petition which was asked of Jehova. And they went unto their domus.</p>
<p>And Jehova visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and born tres filii, and duas filias. And the puer Samuel grew before Jehova.</p>
<p>Now Eli was very senex, and heard all that his filii did unto all Israel; and how they lay with the mulieres that assembled at the door of the tabernaculum of the congregation.</p>
<p>And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your malae ways by all this people.</p>
<p>Nay, my filii; for it is no bona fama that I hear: ye make Jehova's people to transgress.</p>
<p>If one man sin against another, Deus shall judge him: but if a man sin against Jehova, who shall orare for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not to the vox of their pater, because Jehova would slay them.</p>
<p>And the puer Samuel grew on, and was in gratia both with Jehova, and also with men.</p>
<p>And there came a man of Deus to Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith Jehova, I plainly appeared unto the domus of thy pater, when they were in Aegypto in domus of Pharaonis:</p>
<p>And I chose him out of all the tribus of Israel to be my sacerdos, to ascend upon the altare of Jehova, to burn incensum, to wear the ephod before me, and I gave unto the domus of thy pater all the sacrificia of Israel by ignem.</p>
<p>Why kick ye at my sacrificia and at mine offering, which I have commanded in my tabernaculum, and honourest thy filii above me, to make ipsis selves grosse of the primae fruges of every oblation of Israel?</p>
<p>Wherefore Jehova Deus of Israel saith, I said indeed that thy domus, and the domus of thy pater, should walk before me for ever: but now Jehova saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be vile.</p>
<p>Behold, the dies come, that I will cut off thy armus, and the armus of thy pater's domus, that there shall not be an senex in thy domus.</p>
<p>And thou shalt see an afflictio in my tabernaculum: in all the things wherein Israel shall be glorified, and there shall not be an senex in thy domus.</p>
<p>And the man of Deus said unto him, Thus saith Jehova, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the aures of every man that heareth it shall tingle.</p>
<p>In that die I will perform against Eli all things which I have spoken concerning his domus: when I begin, I will also make an finis.</p>
<p>For I have told him that I will judge his domus for ever for the iniquitas: because his filii made themselves detestabilis, and he did not restrain them.</p>
<p>Therefore I have sworn unto the domus of Eli, that the iniquitas of Eli's domus shall not be expiated for ever with sacrificia nor oblation.</p>
<p>And what shall be the thing that shall be done unto thee, and to all thy domus?</p>
<p>And thou shalt see an afflictio of my tabernaculum, even among all the Israelitas, and there shall not be an senex in thy domus for ever.</p>
<p>And the man of Deus went his way, after he had spoken these words unto Eli.</p>
<p>But Samuel grew on, and was accepted: Jehova was with him, and did let none of his verba fall to terra.</p>
<p>And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a propheta of Jehova.</p>
<p>And Jehova appeared again in Silo; for Jehova revealed himself to Samuel in Silo by the vox of Jehova.</p>
