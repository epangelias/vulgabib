  "1. And afterwards Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith Dominus, Rex of Israel, Let my populus go, that they may hold a festum unto me in desertum.",
  "2. And Pharaoh said, Quis est Dominus, ut obediam ei, and send Israel away? I know not Dominus, neither will I let Israel go.",
  "3. And they said, Deus of the Hebraei hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, tria dies journey into desertum, and sacrifice unto Deus our Deus; lest he fall upon us with pestis, or gladius.",
  "4. And the rex of Aegyptus said unto them, Quare do you, Moses and Aaron, dissolere populum ab operibus suis? get you to your onera.",
  "5. And Pharaoh said, Behold, the populus of the terra is now much, and ye make them cease from their onera.",
  "6. And Pharaoh commanded the same die, saying, 7. Ye shall no more give the populus straw to make lateres, as heretofore: let them go and colligere straw for themselves.",
  "7. And the quantitas of lateres, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be ignavi, therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrificare unto Deus our Deus.",
  "8. Let them labour more, and load them with onera, that they may occupare therein, and not regard vana verba.",
  "9. And the ministri populi, and the praepositi, spoke unto the populus, saying, Pharaoh commandeth, saying, Give them not straw.",
  "10. Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not aught of your onera shall be diminished.",
  "11. So the populus were dispersi throughout omnis terra Aegypti, colligere straw for straw.",
  "12. And the praepositi urgebant eos, saying, Completere your onera, as beforetime, when ye had straw.",
  "13. And the ministri populi, and the praepositi, did beat them, saying, Why have ye not completere your onera, as heretofore, and yesterday, and the die before?",
  "14. And the praepositi of the filii Israel came and clamabant unto Pharaoh, saying, Why dealest thou thus with thy servos?",
  "15. There is no straw given unto thy servos, and they say to us, Make lateres: and behold, thy servos are beaten; but the culpa is in thy populus.",
  "16. He said, Ye are ignavi, therefore ye say, Let us go and sacrificare unto Deus.",
  "17. Go therefore now, and operamini; for there shall no straw be given you, yet ye shall deliver the tale of lateres.",
  "18. And the praepositi of the filii Israel did see, that they were in afflictio, and they said, Deus videat vos, and judicet: for ye have made our odium apud Pharaoh, and apud his servos, and put a gladius in eorum manibus to kill nos.",
  "19. And Moses returned unto Deus, and said, Domine, cur affligis populum istum? and why hast thou sent me?",
  "20. For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy nomine, he hath afflictus populum istum; neque autem liberasti populum tuum.",
  "21. And Deus said unto Moses, Nunc videbis, quae faciam Pharaoni: per manum enim fortissimam, et brachium extentum, eiciciam eum, et populum suum ex terra sua."
