                    <p>The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchrum of Jesus, and seeth the lapidem taken away from the sepulchrum.</p>
<p>Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Petrus, and to the other discipulus, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken the Dominum out of the sepulchrum, and we know not where they have laid him.</p>
<p>Petrus therefore went forth, and that other discipulus, and came to the sepulchrum.</p>
<p>So they ran both together: and the other discipulus did outrun Petrus, and came first to the sepulchrum.</p>
<p>And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the lintea ligata, but he went not in.</p>
<p>Then cometh Simon Petrus following him, and went into the sepulchrum, and seeth the lintea ligata,</p>
<p>And the sudarium, that was about his caput, not ligatum with the lintea, but wrapped together in a place by itself.</p>
<p>Then went in also that other discipulus, which came first to the sepulchrum: and he saw, and believed.</p>
<p>For as yet they knew not the Scriptura, that he must rise a mortuis.</p>
<p>Then the discipuli went away again unto themselves.</p>
<p>But Mary stood without at the sepulchrum weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchrum,</p>
<p>And seeth two Angeli in albis sitting, the one at the caput, and the other at the pedes, where the corpus of Jesus had been laid.</p>
<p>And they say unto her, Mulier, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Dominum, and I know not where they have laid him.</p>
<p>And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.</p>
<p>Jesus saith unto her, Mulier, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the hortulanus, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.</p>
<p>Jesus saith unto her, Maria. She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Magister.</p>
<p>Jesus saith unto her, Noli me tangere; for I am not yet ascensus to the Pater: but go to my fratres, and say unto them, I ascend to my Pater, and your Pater; and to my Deus, and your Deus.</p>
<p>Mary Magdalene came and told the discipuli that she had seen the Dominum, and that he had spoken these things unto her.</p>
<p>Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the discipuli were assembled for fear of the Iudaei, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Pax vobis.</p>
<p>And when he had so said, he shewed them his manus, and the costas also.</p>
<p>Then were the discipuli glad, when they saw the Dominum.</p>
<p>Then said Jesus to them again, Pax vobis: as the Pater hath sent me, even so send I you.</p>
<p>And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Accipite Spiritum Sanctum:</p>
<p>Whose peccata you remitt, they are remitted unto them; and whose peccata you retain, they are retained.</p>
<p>But Thomas, one of the duodecim, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.</p>
<p>The other discipuli therefore said unto him, We have seen the Dominum. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his manus the vestigium of the clavi, and put my digitus into the vestigium of the clavi, and thrust my manus into his costas, I will not credere.</p>
<p>And after eight dies again his discipuli were within, and Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Pax vobis.</p>
<p>Then saith he to Thomas, Infer digitum tuum huc, et vide manus meas; et infer manum tuam, et mitte in latus meum: et noli esse incredulus, sed fidelis.</p>
<p>Thomas responded, and said unto him, Dominum meum, et Deus meus.</p>
<p>Jesus saith unto him, Quia vidisti me, Thomas, credidisti: beati qui non viderunt, et crediderunt.</p>
<p>And many other signa truly did Jesus in the presence of his discipuli, which are not written in this libro.</p>
<p>But these are written, that ye might credere that Jesus is the Christus, the Filius Dei; and that credendo ye might have vitam in nomine eius.</p>
<p>And they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward vesper, and the dies is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.</p>
<p>And it came to pass, as he sat at mensa with them, he took panem, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.</p>
<p>And their oculi were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.</p>
<p>And they said one to another, Did not our cordia burn within us, while he talked with us by the via, and while he opened to us the Scripturas?</p>
<p>And they rose up the same hora, and returned to Ierusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,</p>
<p>Saying, The Dominum is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.</p>
<p>And they told what things were done in the via, and how he was known of them in the fractione of the panis.</p>
<p>And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Pax vobis.</p>
<p>But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spiritus.</p>
<p>And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do cogitationes arise in your cordia?</p>
<p>Behold my manus and my pedes, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spiritus hath not caro, and ossa, as ye see me have.</p>
<p>And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his manus and his pedes.</p>
<p>And while they yet believed not for gaudeo, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any cibus?</p>
<p>And they gave him a piece of broiled piscis, and of a honeycomb.</p>
<p>And he took it, and did eat before them.</p>
<p>And he said unto them, These are the verba which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the Lex Mosis, and in the Prophetis, and in the Psalmis, concerning me.</p>
<p>Then opened he their intellectus, that they might understand the Scripturas,</p>
<p>And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christum to suffer, and to rise a mortuis the third die:</p>
<p>That remissio of peccata should be preached in his nomine among all gentes, beginning at Ierusalem.</p>
<p>And ye are testes of these things.</p>
<p>And, behold, I send the promissio of my Pater upon you: but tarry ye in the civitas, until ye be endued with virtus from on high.</p>
<p>And he led them out as far as Bethania, and lifting up his manus, he blessed them.</p>
<p>And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into caelum.</p>
<p>And they worshipped him, and returned to Ierusalem with great gaudeo:</p>
<p>And were continually in the templo, praising and blessing Deus. Amen.</p>
