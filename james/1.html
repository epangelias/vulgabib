                    <p>James, a servant of Deus, and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.</p>
<p>My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;</p>
<p>Knowing this, that the trying of your fides is the evidence of patience.</p>
<p>But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.</p>
<p>If any of you lack sapiencia, let him ask of Deus, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.</p>
<p>But let him ask in fides, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.</p>
<p>For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord;</p>
<p>A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.</p>
<p>Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:</p>
<p>But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the field he shall pass away.</p>
<p>For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.</p>
<p>Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of vita, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.</p>
<p>Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of Deus: for Deus cannot be tempted with malum, neither tempteth he any man:</p>
<p>But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own cupiditas, and enticed.</p>
<p>Then when cupiditas hath conceived, it bringeth forth peccatum; and peccatum, when it is finished, bringeth forth mortem.</p>
<p>Do not err, my beloved brethren.</p>
<p>Every bona gift and perfect donum is from above, and cometh down from the Pater of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.</p>
<p>Of his own voluntas begat he us with the word of veritas, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.</p>
<p>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to ira:</p>
<p>For the ira of man worketh not the justitia of Deus.</p>
<p>Therefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of malum, and receive with meekness the ingrafted word, which is able to save your animas.</p>
<p>But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own yourselves.</p>
<p>For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural facies in a glass:</p>
<p>For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.</p>
<p>But whoso looketh into the perfect law of libertas, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.</p>
<p>If any man among you seem to be religiosus, and bridleth not his lingua, but deceiveth his own cor, this man's religio is vain.</p>
<p>Pure religio and undefiled before Deus and the Pater is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the mundus.</p>
