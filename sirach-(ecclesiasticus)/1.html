                    <p>All wisdom cometh from the Lord Deus, and is with him for ever.</p>
<p>In wisdom is the spirit of vita, and they that possess it are blessed.</p>
<p>For she is more precious than gemmae, and all the things thou canst desire are not comparable unto her.</p>
<p>Length of vita, and years of vita, are in her right hand: and in her left hand riches and honours.</p>
<p>She is more precious also than pearls: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.</p>
<p>Get wisdom, because it is better than the treasure of aurum, and precious than precious pearls.</p>
<p>No precious stone is like her worth: for all gold and silver, and whatsoever is desirabile, are in comparison of her as it were a little sand and a stone of the street.</p>
<p>Blessed is the man that findeth sapientiam, and the man that getteth prudentiam.</p>
<p>For the sale of it is better than the sale of argenti, and the gain thereof than the gain of auri.</p>
<p>She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not comparable to her.</p>
