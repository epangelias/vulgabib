                    <p>And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain dives, who had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his dominus's goods.</p>
<p>And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy negotiatio; for thou mayest be no longer steward.</p>
<p>Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my dominus taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed.</p>
<p>I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their domus.</p>
<p>So he called every one of his dominus's debtors unto him, and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my dominus?</p>
<p>And he said, An hundred measures of oleum. And he said unto him, Take thy scriptura, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.</p>
<p>Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of triticum. And he said unto him, Take thy scriptura, and write fourscore.</p>
<p>And the dominus commended the unjust steward, because he had done prudentiam; for the sons of this world are in their generation more prudent than the sons of lumen.</p>
<p>And I say unto you, Make to yourselves amici of the mammon of iniquity; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitacula.</p>
<p>He that is fidelis in that which is least is fidelis also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.</p>
<p>If therefore ye have not been fidelis in the unjust mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?</p>
<p>And if ye have not been fidelis in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own?</p>
<p>No servant can serve two domini: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve Deus and mammon.</p>
<p>And the Pharisees also, who were amici of pecunia, heard all these things: and they derided him.</p>
<p>And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but Deus knoweth your corda: that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of Deus.</p>
<p>The lex and the prophets were until John: since that time the kingdom of Deus is preached, and every man presseth into it.</p>
<p>And it is easier for caelum and terra to pass, than one tittle of the lex to fail.</p>
<p>Whosoever putteth away his uxor, and marrieth another, committeth adulterium: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her maritus, committeth adulterium.</p>
<p>There was a certain dives, who was clothed in purpura and fine linum, and fared sumptuously every day:</p>
<p>And there was a certain mendicus named Lazarus, who was laid at his porta, full of ulcera,</p>
<p>And desiring to be fed with the panis which fell from the mensa of the dives: moreover the canes came and licked his ulcera.</p>
<p>And it came to pass, that the mendicus died, and was carried by the angeli into Abraham's sinum: the dives also died, and was buried;</p>
<p>And in infernus he lift up his oculi, being in tormentos, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarum in his sinu.</p>
<p>And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have misericordia on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the apex of his digitus in aqua, and cool my lingua; for I am tormented in this flamma.</p>
<p>But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy vita receivedst thy bona things, and likewise Lazarus malum things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.</p>
<p>And beside all this, between us and you there is a great chaos: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence.</p>
<p>Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my domus:</p>
<p>For I have five fratres; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this locus tormentos.</p>
<p>Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.</p>
<p>And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the mortui, they will repent.</p>
<p>And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the mortui.</p>
