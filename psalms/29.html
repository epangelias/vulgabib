                    <p>Give unto the Lord, Dominus, O ye mighty, give unto the Lord glory and strength.</p>
<p>Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name; worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness.</p>
<p>The voice of the Lord is upon the waters: the God of glory thundereth: the Lord is upon many waters.</p>
<p>The voice of the Lord is powerful; the voice of the Lord is full of majesty.</p>
<p>The voice of the Lord breaketh the cedars; yea, the Lord breaketh the cedars of Lebanon.</p>
<p>He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young unicorn.</p>
<p>The voice of the Lord divideth the flames of fire.</p>
<p>The voice of the Lord shaketh the wilderness; the Lord shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh.</p>
<p>The voice of the Lord maketh the hinds to calve, and discovereth the forests: and in his temple doth every one speak of his glory.</p>
<p>The Lord sitteth upon the flood; yea, the Lord sitteth King for ever.</p>
<p>The Lord will give strength unto his people; the Lord will bless his people with pace, pacem.</p>
