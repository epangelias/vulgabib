                    <p>And Dinah the filia of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, went out to see the filiae of the land.</p>
<p>And when Shechem the filius of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the terra, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her.</p>
<p>And his animus clave unto Dinah the filia of Jacob, and he loved the puella, and spake kindly unto the puella.</p>
<p>And Shechem spake unto his pater Hamor, saying, Get me this puella to uxor.</p>
<p>Now Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his filia: and his filii were with his pecus in the ager, and Jacob held his pacem until they were come.</p>
<p>And Hamor the pater of Shechem went out unto Jacob to loqui with him.</p>
<p>And the filii of Jacob came out of the ager when they heard it: and the viri were grieved, and they were very angry, because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's filia: which thing ought not to be done.</p>
<p>And Hamor communed with them, saying, The animus of my filius Shechem longeth for your filia: I pray you, give her him to uxor.</p>
<p>And make ye marriages with us, and give your filiae unto us, and take our filiae unto you.</p>
<p>And ye shall dwell with us: and the terra shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get possessions therein.</p>
<p>And Shechem said unto her pater and unto her fratres, Let me find gratia in your oculi, and what ye shall say unto me I will give.</p>
<p>Ask me multus dowry and donation, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me: but give me the puella to uxor.</p>
<p>And the filii of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his pater deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their soror:</p>
<p>And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our soror to one that is incircumcisus; for that were a reproach unto us:</p>
<p>But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be, that every masculus of you be circumcisus;</p>
<p>Then will we give our filiae unto you, and we will take your filiae to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will be unus populus.</p>
<p>But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcisi, then will we take our filia, and depart.</p>
<p>And their verba pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's filius.</p>
<p>And the iuvenis deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's filia: and he was honoratus above all the domus of his pater.</p>
<p>And Hamor and Shechem his filius came unto the porta of their civitas, and communed with the viri of their civitas, saying,</p>
<p>These homines are pacifici with us; therefore let them dwell in the terra, and trade therein; for the terra, behold, it is larga enough for them; let us take their filiae unto us for uxores, and let us give them our filiae.</p>
<p>Only herein will the homines consent unto us for to dwell with us, to be unus populus, if every masculus among us be circumcisus, as they are circumcisi.</p>
<p>Shall not their pecus, and their substance, and every animal of theirs be ours? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us.</p>
<p>And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his filius hearkened all that went out of the porta of his civitas; and every masculus was circumcisus, all that went out of the porta of his civitas.</p>
<p>And it came to pass on the tertius dies, when they were sore, that two of the filii of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah fratres, took each man his gladius, and came upon the civitas boldly, and slew all the masculi.</p>
<p>And they slew Hamor and Shechem his filius with the oralis of the gladius, and took Dinah out of Shechem's domus, and went out.</p>
<p>The filii of Jacob came upon the interfecti, and spoiled the civitas, because they had defiled their soror:</p>
<p>They took their pecus, and their asini, and their pecus, and that which was in the civitas, and that which was in the ager.</p>
<p>And all their divitiae, and all their pueri, and their uxores took they captive, and spoiled even all that was in the domus.</p>
<p>And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make me odious among the incolae of the terra, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I being few in numero, they shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my domus.</p>
<p>And they said, Should he deal with our soror as with a meretrix?</p>
