                    <p>1 His fundamentum is in the montibus of sanctification, the Lord loveth the portae of Sion more than all the tabernacula of Jacob.</p>
<p>2 Glorious things are spoken of thee, O civitas Dei. Selah.</p>
<p>3 I will make mention of Rahab and Babel to them that know me: behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this man was born there.</p>
<p>4 And of Sion it shall be said, This and that man was born in her: and the highest himself shall establish her.</p>
<p>5 The Lord shall count, when he writeth up the populus, that this man was born there. Selah.</p>
<p>6 As well the singers as the players on instruments shall be there: all my fons are in thee.</p>
<p>7 But as for me, I will declare it from henceforth: I will behold thy facies, O Dei, for I have sought thy faciem.</p>
<p>8 O love the portae of Sion: more than all the tabernacula of Jacob.</p>
<p>9 I will bless the Lord, qui docet me, and my renes also instruct me in the nocte.</p>
<p>10 I have set the Lord always before me: because he is at my dexter, I shall not be moved.</p>
<p>11 Therefore my cor shall be glad, and my lingua shall rejoice: my caro also shall rest in spem.</p>
<p>12 For thou wilt not relinquere my animam in sepulchrum, neither wilt thou suffer thy Sanctus to vide corruption.</p>
<p>13 Thou wilt shew me the semita of vita: in thy praesentia is plenitudo of letitia: at thy dexter there are deliciae for evermore.</p>
