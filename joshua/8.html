                    <p>And the LORD said unto Joshua, 'Veni, vide, vici' (Come, see, conquer), behold, I have given into thy manus (hand) Jericho, and the rex (king) thereof, and the fortis (strong) men of war.</p>
<p>And ye shall compass the civitas (city), all ye viri (men) of war, and go round about the civitas (city) once: thus shalt thou do sex (six) dies (days).</p>
<p>And septem (seven) sacerdotes (priests) shall bear before the arca (ark) septem (seven) buccinae (trumpets) of cornu (horn): and the septimus (seventh) day ye shall compass the civitas (city) septies (seven) times, and the sacerdotes (priests) shall clangere (blow) with the buccinae (trumpets).</p>
<p>And it shall be, when they make sonus (sound) with the buccina (trumpet) of cornu (horn), and when ye hear the vox (voice) of the buccina (trumpet), that all the populus (people) shall clamare (shout) with a great clamor: and the murus (wall) of the civitas (city) shall cadere (fall) downe platum (flat), and the populus (people) shall ascendere (ascend) every man rectus (straight) before him.</p>
<p>And Joshua filius (son) of Nun called the sacerdotes (priests), and said unto them, 'Tollite' (Take) the arca (ark) of the pactum (covenant), and septem (seven) sacerdotes (priests) shall bear septem (seven) buccinae (trumpets) of cornu (horn) before the arca (ark) of the LORD.'</p>
<p>And he said unto the populus (people), 'Ascendere' (Ascend), and compass the civitas (city), and let the armatus (armed) men go before the arca (ark) of the LORD.'</p>
<p>And it came to passe, when Joshua had spoken unto the populus (people), that the septem (seven) sacerdotes (priests) bearing the septem (seven) buccinae (trumpets) of cornu (horn) passed on before the arca (ark) of the LORD, and blew with the buccinae (trumpets): and the arca (ark) of the pactum (covenant) of the LORD followed them.</p>
<p>And the armatus (armed) men went before the sacerdotes (priests) that blew with the buccinae (trumpets), and the coda (rearward) went after the arca (ark), the buccinae (trumpets) sounding, as they went.</p>
<p>And Joshua had commanded the populus (people), saying, 'Vox' (Voice) shall not be heard among you, neither clamor, nor vox (voice) of any kind shall procedere (proceed) out of your os (mouth), until the dies (day) I bid you clamare (shout); then shall ye clamare (shout).'</p>
<p>So the arca (ark) of the LORD compassed the civitas (city), going about it once: and they came into the castra (camp), and lodged in the castra (camp).</p>
<p>And Joshua rose early in the mane (morning), and the sacerdotes (priests) took up the arca (ark) of the LORD.</p>
<p>And the septem (seven) sacerdotes (priests) bearing the septem (seven) buccinae (trumpets) of cornu (horn) before the arca (ark) of the LORD passed on, and blew with the buccinae (trumpets): and the armatus (armed) men went before them; but the coda (rearward) came after the arca (ark) of the LORD, the buccinae (trumpets) sounding, as they went.</p>
<p>And the secundus (second) day they compassed the civitas (city) once, and returned into the castra (camp): so they did sex (six) dies (days).</p>
<p>And it came to passe on the septimus (seventh) day, that they rose early, according to their consuetudo (custom), and compassed the civitas (city) septies (seven) times.</p>
<p>And it came to passe at the septimus (seventh) circuit, when the sacerdotes (priests) blew with the buccinae (trumpets), Joshua said unto the populus (people), 'Clamare' (Shout); for the LORD hath delivered the civitas (city) into your manus (hand).'</p>
<p>And the civitas (city) shall be anathema, it and all that are therein, to the LORD: only Rahab the meretrix (harlot) shall vivere (live), she and all that are with her in the domus (house), because she abscondit (hid) the nuntii (messengers) whom we sent.</p>
<p>And ye, in all sagacitas (wisdom) and industria (industry), get you into the civitas (city), and behold where the murus (wall) is lowest, and there shall ye ascendere (ascend).'</p>
<p>So the populus (people) shouted when the sacerdotes (priests) blew with the buccinae (trumpets): and it came to passe, when the populus (people) heard the vox (voice) of the buccinae (trumpets), and the populus (people) shouted with a great clamor, that the murus (wall) fell downe platum (flat), and the populus (people) went up into the civitas (city), every man rectus (straight) before him, and they took the civitas (city).</p>
<p>And they utterly destruxerunt (destroyed) all that was in the civitas (city), both hominem (man) and mulierem (woman), infantem (infant) and senem (old man), and bos (ox) and asinus (ass), and ovem (sheep), with the mouth of the gladius (sword).</p>
<p>And Joshua saved Rahab the meretrix (harlot) alive, and her domus (house), and all that she had, and she dwelt in the midst of Israel even unto this dies (day); because she hid the nuntii (messengers), whom Joshua sent to explorare (explore) Jericho.</p>
<p>And Joshua adjuravit (adjured) them at that time, saying, 'Maledictus' (Cursed) be the homo (man) before the LORD, that riseth up and rebuildeth this civitas (city) Jericho: with the loss of his primogenitus (firstborn) shall he lay the fundamentum (foundation) thereof, and with the loss of his novissimus (youngest) son shall he set up the portae (gates) thereof.'</p>
<p>So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fama (fame) was in all the terra (land).</p>
