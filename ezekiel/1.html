                    <p>Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river of Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of Deus.</p>
<p>And I looked, and, behold, a tempestuous wind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of electrum, out of the midst of the fire.</p>
<p>Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance; they had the similitude of homines.</p>
<p>Every one had four facies, and every one had four alas. Their pedes were straight pedes; and the solea of their pedes were like the solea of a calf to walk, and they sparkled like the appearance of polished electrum.</p>
<p>And they had manus under their alas on their four sides; and they four had their facies and their alas.</p>
<p>Their alas were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward.</p>
<p>As for the similitude of their facies, they four had the facies of a leo, on the right side: they four had also the facies of a vitulus on the left side; they four also had the facies of a aquila.</p>
<p>Thus were their facies: and their alas were stretched upward; two alas of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their corpora.</p>
<p>And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; and they turned not when they went.</p>
<p>As for the similitude of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of ignis, and like the appearance of lampades: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth fulmen.</p>
<p>And the living creatures ran and returned like the appearance of a fulmen.</p>
<p>Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one rota upon the terra by the living creatures, with his four facies.</p>
<p>The appearance of the rotas and their work was like unto the colour of a berillus: and they four had one similitude: and their appearance and their work was as it were a rota in the midst of a rota.</p>
<p>When they went, they went upon their four sides: and they turned not when they went.</p>
<p>As for their circuli, they were full of oculi round about them four. And when the living creatures went, the rotas went by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the terra, the rotas were lifted up.</p>
<p>Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither was their spirit to go; and the rotas were lifted up along with them: for the spirit of the living creatures was in the rotas.</p>
<p>When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the terra, the rotas were lifted up along with them: for the spirit of the living creatures was in the rotas.</p>
<p>And the similitude of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature was as the colour of the firmament in the aspect of crystal, stretched forth over their heads above.</p>
<p>And under the firmament were their alas straight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their corpora.</p>
<p>And when they went, I heard the noise of their alas, like the noise of many aquae, as the voice of the Omnipotens, the voice of tumult, as the noise of an exercitus: when they stood, they let down their alas.</p>
<p>And there was a voice from the firmament that was over their heads, when they stood, and had let down their alas.</p>
<p>And above the firmament that was over their heads was the similitude of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphirus stone: and upon the similitude of the throne was the similitude as the appearance of a homo above upon it.</p>
<p>And I saw as the colour of electrum: as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his lumbi even upward, and from the appearance of his lumbi even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about.</p>
<p>This was the appearance of the similitude of the glory of the Deus of Israel. And when I saw it, I fell upon my facies, and I heard a voice of one that spake.</p>
