                    <p>Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neque irascaris, for they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb.</p>
<p>Trust in the Lord, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the land, and veritas, thou shalt be fed.</p>
<p>Delight thyself also in the Lord; and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart.</p>
<p>Commit thy way unto the Lord; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass.</p>
<p>And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday.</p>
<p>Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.</p>
<p>Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any wise to do evil.</p>
<p>For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the Lord, they shall inherit the earth.</p>
<p>For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be.</p>
<p>But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of pacis.</p>
<p>The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth.</p>
<p>The Lord shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is coming.</p>
<p>The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy, and to slay such as be of recta animus.</p>
<p>Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.</p>
<p>A little that a justus man hath is better than the riches of many wicked.</p>
<p>For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the Lord upholdeth the justus.</p>
<p>The Lord knoweth the days of the upright, and their inheritance shall be for ever.</p>
<p>They shall not be ashamed in the time of malum, and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.</p>
<p>But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the Lord shall be as the fat of lambs; they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away.</p>
<p>The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the justus sheweth mercy, and giveth.</p>
<p>For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off.</p>
<p>The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord: and he delighteth in his way.</p>
<p>Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand.</p>
<p>I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the justus forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.</p>
<p>He is ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed is blessed.</p>
<p>Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore.</p>
<p>For the Lord loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.</p>
<p>The righteous shall inherit the earth, and dwell therein for evermore.</p>
<p>The mouth of the justus speaketh sapientia, and his tongue talketh of judgment.</p>
<p>The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall slide.</p>
<p>The wicked watcheth the justus, and seeketh to slay him.</p>
<p>The Lord will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged.</p>
<p>Wait on the Lord, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to inherit the earth: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it.</p>
<p>I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green bay tree.</p>
<p>Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not: yea, I sought him, but he could not be found.</p>
<p>Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of that man is pacis.</p>
<p>But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of the wicked shall be cut off.</p>
<p>But the salvation of the justus is of the Lord: he is their strength in the time of trouble.</p>
<p>And the Lord shall help them, and deliver them: he shall deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they trust in him.</p>
