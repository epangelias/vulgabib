  "In principio, God created the caelum and the terra.",
  "And the terra was without forma, and void; and tenebrae was upon the facies of the profundum. And the Spiritus of God moved upon the facies of the aquae.",
  "The earth was void, and vacuus; and tenebrae was upon the facies of the abyssus. And the Spiritus of God moved upon the facies of the aquae.",
  "And God said, Fiat lux; and facta est lux.",
  "And God saw the lux, that it was bonum; and God divided the lux from the tenebrae.",
  "And God called the lux, Dies; and the tenebrae, he called Nox. And there was vespere, and there was mane, Dies unus.",
  "And God said, Fiat firmamentum in medio aquarum; and it was so.",
  "And God called the firmamentum, Caelum. And there was vespere, and there was mane, Dies secundus.",
  "And God said, Congregentur aquae, quae sub caelo sunt, in locum unum; et appareat arida.",
  "And it was so. And God called the arida, Terra; and congregationes aquarum, he called Maria.",
  "And God saw that it was bonum.",
  "And God said, Germinent terra herbam virentem, and facientem semen, and lignum pomiferum faciens fructum iuxta genus suum, cuius semen in semetipso sit super terram; et factum est ita.",
  "And the terra produxit herbam virentem, and facientem semen iuxta genus suum, and lignum faciens fructum, et habens semen secundum genus suum; et vidit Deus quod esset bonum.",
  "And there was vespere, and there was mane, Dies tertius."
