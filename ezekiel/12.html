                    <p>1. The word of the LORD also came unto me, saying, 2. Son of homo, thou dwellest in the midst of domus rebellis, that have eyes to see, and see not; they have aures to hear, and hear not: for they are gens rebellis.</p>
<p>3. Therefore, thou son of homo, prepare thee stuff for removing, and remove by day in their sight; and thou shalt remove from thy place to another place in their sight: it may be they will consider, though they be gens rebellis.</p>
<p>4. Then shalt thou bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight, as stuff for removing: and thou shalt go forth at even in their sight, as they that go forth into captivitas.</p>
<p>5. Dig thou through the wall in their sight, and carry out thereby.</p>
<p>6. In their sight shalt thou bear it upon thy shoulders, and carry it forth in the dark: thou shalt cover thy face, that thou see not the terra: for I have set thee for a sign unto domus Israel.</p>
<p>7. And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by day, as stuff for removing, and in the even I digged through the wall with mine hand; I brought it forth in the dark, and I bare it upon my shoulder in their sight.</p>
<p>8. And in the morning came the word of the LORD unto me, saying, 9. Son of homo, hath not domus Israel, the rebellis, said unto thee, What doest thou?</p>
<p>10. Say thou unto them, Thus saith Dominus Deus; This burden concerneth the prince in Jerusalem, and all domus Israel that are among them.</p>
<p>11. Say, I am your sign: as I have done, so shall it be done unto them: they shall remove and go into captivitas.</p>
<p>12. And the prince that is among them shall bear upon his shoulder in the dark, and shall go forth: they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby: he shall cover his face, that he see not the terra.</p>
<p>13. My net also will I spread upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare: and I will bring him to Babylon to the terra of the Chaldeans; yet he shall not see it, though he shall die there.</p>
<p>14. And I will scatter toward every ventus all that are about him to help him, and all his cohorts: and I will draw out the gladius after them.</p>
<p>15. And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall scatter them among the gentes, and disperse them in the terrae.</p>
<p>16. But I will leave a few hommes of them from the gladius, from the famis, and from the pestis; that they may declare all their abomination among the gentes whither they come; and they shall know that I am the LORD.</p>
<p>17. Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 18. Son of homo, eat thy bread with quaking, and drink thy water with trembling and with carefulness;</p>
<p>19. And say to the people of the terra, Thus saith Dominus Deus of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and of the terra of Israel; They shall eat their panem with carefulness, and drink their water with astonishment, that her terra may be desolate from all that is therein, because of the violence of all them that dwell therein.</p>
<p>20. And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the terra shall be desolate; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.</p>
<p>21. And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 22. Son of homo, what is that proverb that ye have in the terra of Israel, saying, The dies are prolonged, and every visio faileth?</p>
<p>23. Tell them therefore, Thus saith Dominus Deus; I will make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel; but say unto them, The dies are at hand, and the effect of every visio.</p>
<p>24. For there shall be no more any vana visio nor flattering divinatio within domus Israel.</p>
<p>25. For I am the LORD: I will speak, and the word that I shall speak shall come to pass; it shall be no more prolonged: for in your dies, O rebellis domus, will I say the word, and will perform it, saith Dominus Deus.</p>
<p>26. Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 27. Son of homo, behold, they of the domus of Israel say, The visio that he seeth is for many dies to come, and he prophesieth of the times that are far off.</p>
<p>28. Therefore say unto them, Thus saith Dominus Deus; There shall none of my words be any more prolonged, but the word which I have spoken shall be done, saith Dominus Deus.</p>
