  "Lord, remember David, and all his afflictiones,",
  "How he sware unto the Lord, and vowed unto the Deus of Jacob,",
  "Surely I will not come into the tabernaculum of my domus, nor go up into my lectus;",
  "I will not give somnus to mine oculi, or slumber to mine eyelids;",
  "Until I find out a locum for the Lord, an habitation for the Deus of Jacob.",
  "Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the nemus of the forest;",
  "We will go into his tabernaculum: we will worship at his pedes.",
  "Arise, O Lord, into thy requies: thou, and the arca of thy potentia.",
  "Let thy sacerdotes be clothed with iustitia; and let thy sancti rejoice;",
  "For thy servus David's sake turne not away the facies of thine unctus.",
  "The Lord hath sworn in veritate unto David; he will not turne from it; Of the fructus of thy ventris will I set upon thy thronus.",
  "If thy filii will keep my pactum and my testimonium that I shall teach them, their filii shall also sit upon thy thronus for evermore.",
  "For the Lord hath elected Sion; he hath desired it for his habitaculum.",
  "This shall be my requies for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it.",
  "I will abundantly bless her victum: I will satisfie her pauperes with panis.",
  "I will also clothe her sacerdotes with salvus: and her sancti shall shout for iucunditas.",
  "There will I make the potentia of David to ascend: I have ordained a lucerna for mine unctus.",
  "His inimici I will clothe with confusio: but upon himself shall his coronet florish."
