  "Pilatus therefore took Jesus, and scourged him, with flagellis.",
  "And the soldiers plaited a corona of thorns, and put it on his caput, and they put on him a purple garment, and said, Hail, Rex of the Judaei!",
  "And they came to him, and said, Hail, Rex of the Judaei! and they gave him a basium.",
  "Pilatus therefore went out again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no culpa in him.",
  "Then came Jesus forth, wearing the corona of thorns, and the purple garment: and Pilatus saith unto them, Ecce Homo!",
  "When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucifige, crucifige him. Pilatus saith unto them, Take ye him, and crucify him: for I find no culpa in him.",
  "The Judaei answered him, We have a lex, and by our lex he ought to die, because he made se ipse Filius Dei.",
  "When Pilatus therefore heard that saying, he was the more metus: and going into the hall of judgment he saith unto Jesus, Unde es tu? But Jesus gave him no responsio.",
  "Then saith Pilatus unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have potestas to crucify thee, and have potestas to release thee?",
  "Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no potestas at all against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater peccatum.",
  "From thenceforth Pilatus sought to release him: but the Judaei cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar's friend: whosoever maketh himself Rex, speaketh against Caesar.",
  "When Pilatus therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the tribunal in the place that is called Lithostrotos, but in the Hebrew tongue Gabbatha.",
  "And it was the parasceve of the pascha, and about the sexta hora: and he saith unto the Judaei, Ecce Rex vester!",
  "But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him. Pilatus saith unto them, Shall I crucify your Rex? The chief priests answered, We have no rex but Caesar.",
  "Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him away.",
  "And he bearing his crux went forth into a place called Calvaria, but in Hebrew Golgotha:",
  "Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.",
  "And Pilatus wrote a titulus, and put it on the crux. And the writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE REX OF THE JUDAEI.",
  "This titulus then read many of the Judaei: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the civitas: and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin.",
  "Then said the chief priests of the Judaei to Pilatus, Write not, The Rex of the Judaei; but that he said, I am Rex of the Judaei.",
  "Pilatus answered, What I have written I have written.",
  "Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his vestes, and made four partes, to every soldier a parte; and also his tunic, which was without seam, woven from the top throughout.",
  "They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the Scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my vestes among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.",
  "Now there stood by the crux of Jesus his mater, and his mater's soror, Maria the wife of Cleophas, and Maria Magdalene.",
  "When Jesus therefore saw his mater, and the discipulus standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mater, Mulier, behold thy filius!",
  "Then saith he to the discipulus, Behold thy mater! And from that hora that discipulus took her unto his own domus.",
  "After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now consummated, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst.",
  "Now there was set a vas full of acetum: and they filled a spunge with acetum, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his os.",
  "When Jesus therefore had received the acetum, he said, Consummatum est: and he bowed his caput, and gave up the spirit.",
  "The Judaei therefore, because it was the parasceve, that the bodies should not remain upon the crux on the sabbatum, (for that sabbatum was a great dies,) besought Pilatus that their ossa might be broken, and that they might be taken away.",
  "Then came the soldiers, and brake the ossa of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him.",
  "But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was already mortuus, they brake not his ossa:",
  "For these things were done, that the Scripture should be fulfilled, A os non comminuetis ex eo.",
  "And again another Scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.",
  "And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a discipulus of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Judaei, besought Pilatus that he might take away the corpus of Jesus: and Pilatus gave him leave. He came therefore, and took the corpus of Jesus.",
  "And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by nocte, and brought a mixture of myrrha and aloes, about an hundred pound weight.",
  "Then took they the corpus of Jesus, and wound it in linteis with the aromata, as the manner of the Judaei is to bury.",
  "Now in the place where he was crucified there was a hortus; and in the hortus a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid.",
  "There laid they Jesus therefore because of the parasceve of the Judaei; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand."
