  "Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hamus, or his lingua with a funis, which thou lettest down?",
  "Canst thou put a circulus in his nasus, or perforare his maxilla with an hamus?",
  "Shall he make many supplicationes unto thee? shall he speak soft sermones unto thee?",
  "Shall he make a foedus with thee? shalt thou take him for a servus for ever?",
  "Shall thou play with him as with a passer, or bind him for thy puellae?",
  "Shall the socii make a banquet of him? shall they partire him among the negotiatores?",
  "Shall he fill his pelagus with his scutum? or his caput with his spina?",
  "Lay thine hand upon him, remember the pugna, and do no more.",
  "Behold, the sperare of him is in vaine: shall not one be cast down even at the aspectus of him?",
  "None is so audax as to stirre him up: who then is able to stand before me?",
  "Who hath prevented me, that I should retribuere him? what is under the totum caelum is mine.",
  "I will not conceal his partes, nor his potentia, nor his elegantia of his cutis.",
  "Who can discover the faciem of his vestimentum? or who can come to him with a morsus?",
  "Who can open the ostia of his faciem? his dentes are terribiles round about.",
  "His laus are his vestimentum, shut up together as with a sigillum.",
  "One is so neare to another, that no air can come betweene them.",
  "They are ioyned one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be separated.",
  "His nebulosus are a spreading of his lumina, they are as the aurora in the morning.",
  "Out of his mouth go burning lampades, and sparulae of fire are cast abroad.",
  "Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a great ollae or caldron.",
  "His halitus kindleth coals, and there is a flamma that goeth out of his os.",
  "In his collo is strength, and power is in the nucha of his cervix.",
  "The flexura of his renes is not broken.",
  "His cor is as a petra, and his renes are as a mola.",
  "When he raiseth up himselfe, the potentissimi are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves.",
  "The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the lance, the sagitta, or the habergeon.",
  "He esteemeth iron as straw, and bronz as rotten wood.",
  "The archus cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stipula.",
  "He laugheth at the shaking of a lance, and at the sound of a tuba.",
  "He maketh the profundum to boile like a pot: he maketh the mare to seeth like a pot of unguentum.",
  "He maketh a path to shine after him, he maketh the profundum to be hoary as the albus caput.",
  "Upon terre he is not, for all he is king over all the filii of superbia."
