                    <p>Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek: and the Israelites pitched by a fountain which is in Jezreel, valles Iezrahelis.</p>
<p>And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands: but David and his men passed on in the rereward with Achish.</p>
<p>Then said the princes of the Philistines, What do these Hebraei here? And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines, Is not this David, the servus of Saul the king of Israel, which hath been with me these dies, or this secundus year, and I have found no fault in him since he fell unto me unto this dies?</p>
<p>And the princes of the Philistines were angry with him; and the princes of the Philistines said unto him, Make this homo return, that he may go again to his locum, which thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he be our inimicus.</p>
<p>Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in choros, saying, Saul slew his mille, and David his decem milia?</p>
<p>And Achish called David, and said unto him, Surely, as Jehovah liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the castris is bonus in my eyes: for I have not found in thee malum since the dies of thy coming unto me unto this dies: nevertheless the princes do not favere thee.</p>
<p>Wherefore now return, and go in pacem, that thou displease not the princes of the Philistines.</p>
<p>And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what hast thou found in thy servus since the dies that I have been with thee unto this dies, that I may not go fight against the inimici of my domine the king?</p>
<p>And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou art bonus in my eyes, like an angel of Deus: notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the bellum.</p>
<p>Now therefore rise up early in the morning with thy domus of thy pater, and the reliqui, and go to the locum which I have appointed you, and go not thou in malum in my eyes, since thou art bonus in my eyes, and rise up in mane to viam, and go in lumine.</p>
<p>So David and his homines rose up early to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel.</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when David and his homines were come to Ziklag on the tertius dies, that the Amalekites had invaded the austral part, and Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burned it with ignis;</p>
<p>And had taken the mulieres captivas, that were therein: they slew not any, either great or small, but carried them away, and went on their viam.</p>
<p>So David and his homines came to the civitas, and, behold, it was burned with ignis; and their uxores, and their filii, and their filiae were taken captivi.</p>
<p>Then David and the populus that was with him lifted up their vocem, and wept, until they had no more lacrimae to weep.</p>
<p>And David's uxor, Ahinoam, the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite, had been taken captivas.</p>
<p>And David was greatly distressed; for the populus spake of lapidando him, because the animus of all the populus was bitter, every homo for his filii and for his filiae: but David encouraged himself in Jehovah his Deus.</p>
<p>And David said to Abiathar the sacerdos, Bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David.</p>
<p>And David inquired at Deus, saying, Shall I pursue after this troop? shall I overtake them? And he answered him, Pursue: for thou shalt surely overtake them, and without fail recover all.</p>
<p>So David went, he and the sexcenti homines that were with him, and came to the rivus Besor, where those that were left behind stayed.</p>
<p>But David pursued, he and quadringenti homines: for duo centum abided behind, which were so fatigati that they could not go over the rivus Besor.</p>
<p>And they found an Aegyptius in the ager, left behind of the host, and brought him to David, and gave him panis, and he did eat; and they made him drink aqua;</p>
<p>And they gave him a partem of mel, and two cakes of figs, and when he had eaten, his spirit returned to him: for he had eaten no panis, nor drunk aqua, three dies and three noctes.</p>
<p>And David said unto him, To whom belongest thou? and whence art thou? And he said, I am a puer of an Aegyptius, servus to an Amalekite; and my domine left me behind, when I fell sick tres dies ago.</p>
<p>I was in the ager gathering stickes: and we departed from our castra, and the Amalekites had invaded the austral part, and Ziklag, and had smitten Ziklag, and burned it with ignis;</p>
<p>And they took the mulieres captivas that were in it, whom they did not interficere, and they went on their viam.</p>
<p>Now therefore, as Jehovah liveth, who hath delivered me out of all angustia, if I shall smite the terram of the Philistines this nocte, and we shall overtake them, till they waxe calidi in the mane of the dies;</p>
<p>If I shall not interficere him of the juvenes unto the seniorem, nor reservare femellas of them: then will I shew you what Deus will do unto my domine, and unto his hereditas.</p>
<p>So David and the sexcenti homines that were with him went to the rivus Besor, where those that were left behind stayed.</p>
<p>But David pursued, he and quadringenti homines, for duo centum stayed behind, which were so fatigati that they could not go over the rivus Besor.</p>
<p>And when David came to the duo centum homines that were so fatigati that they could not follow David, whom they had made to stay at the rivus Besor, they went forth to meet David, and to the populus that were with him: and when David came near to the populus, he saluted them in pacem.</p>
<p>And when they of David's homines that went with him said unto him, seeing the Amalekites had spread themselves upon the terra, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the magna praeda they had taken out of the terra of the Philistines, and out of the terra of Judah;</p>
<p>And David smote them from the mane of the dies even unto the vespera of the altera dies: and there escaped not a homo of them, save quadringenti pueri, which rode upon cameli, and fled.</p>
<p>And David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken away: and David rescued his uxor Ahinoam.</p>
<p>And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither filii nor filiae, neither spolia, nor any thing that they had taken to them: David recovered all.</p>
<p>And David took all the ovium, and the bobes, and drove them before the pecus, and said, This is David's praeda.</p>
<p>And David came to the duo centum homines, which were so fatigati that they could not follow him, whom they had made to stay at the rivus Besor: and they went forth to meet David, and to the populus that were with him: and when David came near to the populus, he saluted them in pacem.</p>
<p>And when they of David's homines that went with him said unto him, seeing the Amalekites had spread themselves upon the terra, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the magna praeda they had taken out of the terra of the Philistines, and out of the terra of Judah;</p>
<p>Then David said, Ye shall not do so, my fratres, with that which Deus hath delivered unto us, who hath preserved us, and delivered into our manus the company that came against us.</p>
<p>For who will hearken unto you in this materia? for as his pars is that goeth down to the bellum, so shall his pars be of the spolia.</p>
<p>And it shall be, when we come into the terra of the filii Israel, that we will divide our possession with them, and with them that went down to the bellum.</p>
<p>So all the populus gave a clamor, and all the Israelites went to their civitas, and every homo went to his domus.</p>
<p>And David and his homines came to Ziklag, and sent of the praeda unto the seniorem of Judah, and unto his amici, saying, Behold a praeda for you of the inimici of Deus;</p>
<p>To them which were in Bethel, and to them which were in south Ramoth, and to them which were in Jattir,</p>
<p>And to them which were in Aroer, and to them which were in Siphmoth, and to them which were in Eshtemoa,</p>
<p>And to them which were in Rachal, and to them which were in the civitas of the Jerahmeelites, and to them which were in the civitas of the Kenites,</p>
<p>And to them which were in Hormah, and to them which were in Chorashan, and to them which were in Athach,</p>
<p>And to them which were in Hebron, and to all the loca where David himself and his homines were wont to haunt.</p>
<p>And it came to pass after this, that David inquired of Deus, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into mine manus? And Deus said unto him, Go up; for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into thy manus.</p>
<p>And David came to Baalperazim, and David smote them there, and said, Deus hath divided mine inimicos before me, as the divisio of aqua. Therefore they called the nomine of that locum Baalperazim.</p>
<p>And they left their idola there, and David and his homines took them away.</p>
<p>And the Philistines yet again spread themselves in the vallis Rephaim.</p>
<p>And David inquired again of Deus; and Deus said unto him, Go not up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over against the baca mulierum:</p>
<p>And it shall be, when thou hearest the sonus of marching in the baca mulierum, that thou shalt bestir thyself: for then shall Deus gone forth before thee to smite the castrum of the Philistines.</p>
<p>Then did David as Deus had commanded him: and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gazer.</p>
