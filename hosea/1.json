  "1 The word of the Dominus that came unto Hosea, the son of Beeri, in the dies of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the dies of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.",
  "2 The beginning of the word of the Dominus by Hosea. And the Dominus said to Hosea, Go, take unto thee a woman of whoredoms and children of whoredoms: for the terra hath committed great whoredom, departing from the Dominus.",
  "3 So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; which conceived, and bare him a filium.",
  "4 And the Dominus said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will visit the blood of Jezreel upon the domus of Jehu, and will cause to cease the regnum of the domus of Israel.",
  "5 And it shall come to pass at that die, that I will break the arcus of Israel in the valle of Jezreel.",
  "6 And she conceived again, and bare a filiam. And God said unto him, Call her name Loruhamah: for I will no more have misericordia upon the domus of Israel; but I will utterly take them away.",
  "7 But I will have misericordia upon the domus of Judah, and will save them by the Dominus their Deus, and will not save them by arcus, nor by gladius, nor by equus, nor by currus.",
  "8 Now when she had weaned Loruhamah, she conceived, and bare a filium.",
  "9 Then said God, Call his name Loammi: for ye are not my populus, and I will not be your Deus.",
  "10 Yet the numero of the filii of Israel shall be as the arena of the mari: which cannot be mensurata nor numerata; and it shall come to pass, that in the loco where it was said unto them, Ye are not my populus, there it shall be said unto them, Ye are the filii of the viventis Deus."
