  "Hear, O Israel: The Lord our Deus is one Lord: Ye shall love the Lord thy Deus with all thine heart, and with all thy animus, and with all thy potentia.",
  "Ye shall not make thee any sculptura, or imago of any thing that is in caelum above, or that is in terra beneath, or that is in aqua beneath the terra.",
  "Thou shalt not adore them, nor servire them: I am the Lord thy Deus, a Deus zelotes, visiting the iniquitas of patres upon filii unto the third and fourth generatio of them that hate me.",
  "Thou shalt not take the nomen of the Lord thy Deus in vanum: for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his nomen in vanum.",
  "Remember the dies Sabbati, to keep it sanctum.",
  "Six dies thou shalt labor, and do all thy opus: But the seventh dies is the Sabbatum of the Lord thy Deus: in it thou shalt not do any opus, thou, nor thy filius, nor thy filia, nor thy servus, nor thy ancilla, nor thine asinus, nor thy peregrinus that is within thy portae.",
  "That thy servus and thy ancilla may rest as well as thou.",
  "And thou shalt remember that thou wast a servus in terra Aegypti, and that the Lord thy Deus brought thee out thence through a manum fortis and a brachium extentum: therefore the Lord thy Deus commanded thee to keep the dies Sabbati.",
  "Honora patrem tuum and matrem tuam, as the Lord thy Deus hath commanded thee; that thy dies may be prolonged, and that it may go well with thee, in the terra which the Lord thy Deus giveth thee.",
  "Non occides.",
  "Non moechaberis.",
  "Non furtum facies.",
  "Non loqueris contra proximum tuum falsum testimonium.",
  "Non concupisces uxorem proximi tui, non domum, non agrum, non servum, non ancillam, non bovem, non asinum, et omnia quae sunt proximi tui."
