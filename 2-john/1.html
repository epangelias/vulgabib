                    <p>The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in veritas, and not I only, but also all they that have known the veritas;</p>
<p>Because of the veritas which abideth in us, and shall be with us for ever.</p>
<p>Grace be with you, mercy, and pax, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in veritas and caritas.</p>
<p>I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in veritas, as we have received a mandatum from the Father.</p>
<p>And now I beseech thee, lady, not as writing a new mandatum unto thee, but that which we had from the principio, that we love one another.</p>
<p>And this is the love, that we walk after his mandata. This is the mandatum, That, as ye have heard from the principio, ye should walk in it.</p>
<p>For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in carne: this is a deceiver and an antichrist.</p>
<p>Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.</p>
<p>Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrina of Christ, hath not Deus: he that abideth in the doctrina of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.</p>
<p>If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrina, receive him not into your domus, neither bid him Ave.</p>
<p>For he that biddeth him Ave is partaker of his malum deeds.</p>
<p>Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our gaudeo may be full.</p>
<p>The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen.</p>
