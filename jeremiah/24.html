                    <p>The word of the Lord came unto me again, saying, O domus Israel, Thus saith the Lord; As the vinum in the cluster is found, so have I caused the filii Israel to find, saith the Lord.</p>
<p>Behold, the eyes of the Lord, which are upon the Regnum malum, to destroy it utterly from off the facies of the terra, saith the Lord.</p>
<p>And I will give them into the manum of those that seek their vita, and into the manus of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the manum of his servos: but after that, it shall be given into the manus of the filii Israel, saith the Lord.</p>
<p>Hark, a tumultuous noise cometh from the terra septentrionalis, to make the civitates of Judah desolate, and a lair of dragons.</p>
<p>And I will make Jerusalem piles of lapides, a lair of dragons; and I will lay the civitates of Judah waste, without an inhabitant.</p>
<p>And I will take away from them the vocem of gaudium and the vocem of laetitiam, the sponsum and the sponsam, the sweete sounde of the tibiarum, and the lumina of the candelabrum.</p>
<p>And it shall be, when they shall say unto thee, Whither shall we go? then thou shalt tell them, Thus saith the Lord, Such as are for morte, to morte; and such as are for gladium, to gladium; and such as are for famis, to famis; and such as are for captivitas, to captivitas.</p>
<p>And I will visit upon them, in anno visitationis, saith the Lord, and I will make the gladius to visit them, because of the malitia of their iniquitas, quia peccaverunt contra me, and against my nomen maledixerunt.</p>
<p>Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will command, and I will bring upon them the gentem, a nation mighty and potent, from the terra septentrionalis, upon the inhabitantes of the terra, from the extremity of the terre, against them.</p>
<p>And they shall slay them with gladio, and with famis, and with pestis: and I will give their cadavera to be meat for the avis coelestis, and for the bestias of the terra.</p>
<p>And I will make this civitas desolate, and a hissing; every passer by shall be astonished at her plagas, and shall hiss at all her vulnera.</p>
<p>And I will take away from this place, saith the Lord, the vocem of gaudium and the vocem of laetitiam, the sponsum and the sponsam, the sweet sound of the tibiarum.</p>
<p>And the whole terra shall be desolate, and they shall serve among the gentes septem annis, for the peccata of their iniquitas, quia peccaverunt against me.</p>
<p>And it shall come to pass, when septem anni are accomplished, that I will send against them the cucumis, and the locusta, to devour the reliquiae of her herba, and the fructus of the terra, which is left by the army of the gentes, saith the Lord.</p>
<p>Thus saith the Lord, Ye shall not say, The Lord liveth, that brought up the filii Israel out of the terra of Egypt;</p>
<p>But, The Lord liveth, that brought up the domum Israel from the terra septentrionalis, and from all the terrae, to which he had expulsed them: and I will bring them againe into their terra, which I gave unto their patres.</p>
<p>Behold, I will send for many fishers, saith the Lord, and they shall fish them; and after that, I will send for many venatores, and they shall hunt them from every monte, and from every collem.</p>
<p>For mine oculus are upon all their viae, they are not hid from my facie, neither is their iniquitas hidden from mine oculis.</p>
<p>First, I will retribuere double unto them their iniquitas, and their peccata, because they have pollutum my nomen maledicto, and they have sacrificatum in the montibus, and have reproachfully blasphemed in the colles: thus I will retribuere their via in their sinew, saith the Lord.</p>
<p>O Lord, thou art just, for I have receaved thy judicia, and have put my fiduciam in thee, and have not been confusus.</p>
