                    <p>Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes rex of Persia, Ezra the sacerdos, the filius of Seraiah, the filius of Azariah, the filius of Hilkiah,</p>
<p>The filius of Shallum, the filius of Zadok, the filius of Ahitub, the filius of Amariah, the filius of Azariah, the filius of Meraioth,</p>
<p>The filius of Zerahiah, the filius of Uzzi, the filius of Bukki, the filius of Abishua, the filius of Phinehas, the filius of Eleazar, the filius of Aaron the pontifex maximus:</p>
<p>This Ezra went up from Babylon; and he was a sacerdos, a scriptor in the libros of the mandata of Deus, and a veritas of the verbum of Deus, which was given unto him in Israel.</p>
<p>And the rex gave him according to the manus of Deus his Deus upon him.</p>
<p>And there went up some of the filii of Israel, and of the sacerdotes, and the Levites, and the cantores, and the portatores, and the Nethinims, unto Ierusalem, in the septimus year of Artaxerxes the rex.</p>
<p>And he came to Ierusalem in the quintus mensis, which was in the septimus year of the rex.</p>
<p>For upon the primus die of the mensis he began to ascend from Babylon, and on the primus die of the quintus mensis came he to Ierusalem, according to the bonus manus of his Deus upon him.</p>
<p>For Ezra had prepared his cor to inquire the lex of Deus, and to do it, and to docere in Israel the statuta and the iudicia.</p>
<p>Now this is the copia of the epistula of the rex Artaxerxes given unto Ezra the sacerdos, the sacerdos, a scriptor of the verbum of Deus, and of the mandata of Deus, and of the statuta of the sacerdotes and Levites, unto Israel in Ierusalem:</p>
<p>Artaxerxes, rex of reges, unto Ezra the sacerdos, a perfectus scriptor of the lex of Deus of caelum, salus.</p>
<p>Forasmuch as thou art sent of the rex, and of his septem consiliarii, to inquire concerning Iudaea and Ierusalem, according to the lex of Deus thy Deus, which is in thy manus;</p>
<p>And to bear the argentum and aurum, which the rex and his consiliarii have offered unto the Deus of Israel, whose tabernaculum is in Ierusalem:</p>
<p>And all the argentum and aurum that thou shalt find in all the provincia of Babylon, with the voluntas of the populus, and of the sacerdotes, offering willingly for the domus of Deus which is in Ierusalem:</p>
<p>That thou mayest buy speedily with this argentum boves, arietes, agni, with their sacrificia, and libamina, and offer them upon the altare of the domus of your Deus which is in Ierusalem.</p>
<p>And whatsoever shall seem bonus unto thee and to thy fratres, to do with the rest of the argentum and aurum, that do after the voluntas of your Deus.</p>
<p>The vascula also that are given thee for the ministerium of the domus of Deus, those deliver thou before the Deus of Ierusalem.</p>
<p>And whatsoever more shall be needful for the domus of Deus, which thou shalt have occasion to bestow, bestow it out of the regis thesaurus.</p>
<p>And I, even I Artaxerxes the rex, do make a decretum to all the thesaurarii which are beyond the flumen, that whatsoever Ezra the sacerdos, the scriptor of the lex of Deus of caelum, shall require of you, it be done speedily,</p>
<p>Unto an hundred talenta of argentum, and to an hundred choroi of wheat, and to an hundred bati of vinum, and to an hundred bati of oleum, and salt without reckoning.</p>
<p>Whatsoever is commanded by the Deus of caelum, let it be diligently done for the domus of the Deus of caelum: for why should there be indignatio against the regnum of the rex and his filii?</p>
<p>Also we certify you, that touching any of the sacerdotes, and Levites, singers, porters, Nethinims, or ministers of this domus of Deus, it shall not be lawfull to impose toll, tribute, or custom, upon them.</p>
<p>And thou, Ezra, after the sapientia of Deus that is in thy manus, thou shalt appoint iudices and magistrates, which may iudicia in all Israel, that is beyond the flumen, of them that knowe the libros of Deus, and those that are ignorant, ye shall teach them.</p>
<p>And whosoever will not do the lex of Deus, and the lex of the rex, let iudicium be executed speedily upon him, whether it be unto mortem, or to exilium, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment.</p>
<p>Blessed be Deus the Pater of our patres, who hath put such a thing as this in the rex heart, to beautify the domus of Deus which is in Ierusalem:</p>
<p>And hath extended mercia unto me before the rex, and his consiliarii, and before all the rex potentissimi: thus I was confirmed in the spirit to goe up to Ierusalem. And when I came to Ierusalem, and had been there three dies,</p>
<p>Then I rose up in the nocte, I and some few men with me; neither told I any man what Deus had put in my cor to do at Ierusalem: neither was there any beast with me, save those that I rode upon.</p>
<p>And I went out by the porta of the vallis toward the fontis of the drag√≥n, and to the porta of the dung-port, and viewed the muri of Ierusalem, which were broken down, and the portae thereof were consumed with ignis.</p>
<p>Then I went on to the porta of the fontis, and to the regia piscina: but there was no locus for the beast that was under me to pass.</p>
<p>Then went I up in the nocte by the torrent of the vallis, and viewed the murus, and turned back, and entered by the porta of the vallis, and so returned.</p>
<p>And the magistratus said unto me, From whence dost thou come? And I said unto them, I am of the semina of the regnum of Iudaea, and I came to inquire concerning the domus of Deus, and to do his voluntas.</p>
<p>And I told them according to the manus of Deus my Deus upon me, and according to the bonus manus of the rex towards me, and they gave me magistratus and equites to accompany me.</p>
<p>Then I came to the flumen of Ahava, where I beheld a multitude of mulieres and filii, and beasts, but there was no argentum nor aurum to bring to Ierusalem.</p>
<p>Then I rebuked the magistratus, and said, What is this wickedness that ye do, and why do ye forsake the domus of Deus, and go every man to his domus?</p>
<p>And I gathered them together to the flumen of Ahava, and we pitched there in the tabernacula three dies: and I viewed the populus and the sacerdotes, and found there none of the filii of Levi.</p>
<p>Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, principes; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, men of sapientia.</p>
<p>And I gave them mandata unto Iddo the prince in the locus Casiphia, and I put in their bucca the verba that they should speak unto Iddo, and to his fratres the Nethinims, in the locus Casiphia, to bring unto us ministri for the domus of our Deus.</p>
<p>And by the bonus manus of our Deus upon us, they brought us a vir prudentissimus of the filii of Mahli, the filius of Levi, the filius of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his filii and fratres, eighteen;</p>
<p>And Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the filii of Merari, his fratres and filii, twenty;</p>
<p>Also of the Nethinims, whom David and the principes had appointed for the ministerium of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinims: all of them were expressed by nomina.</p>
<p>Then I sanctified them for the ministerium of the domus of Deus, and for the ministerium of the rex, and for the ministerium of the principes, and for the ministerium of the Levites.</p>
<p>And I viewed the populus for the ministerium of the domus of Deus, and I found there none of the filii of Levi.</p>
<p>Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, principes; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, men of sapientia.</p>
<p>And I gave them mandata unto Iddo the prince in the locus Casiphia, and I put in their bucca the verba that they should speak unto Iddo, and to his fratres the Nethinims, in the locus Casiphia, to bring unto us ministri for the domus of our Deus.</p>
<p>So we fasted and besought our Deus for this, and he was exauditus unto us.</p>
<p>Then I separated twelve of the principes of the sacerdotes, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their fratres with them,</p>
<p>And weighed unto them the argentum, and the aurum, and the vascula, even the oblation of the domus of our Deus, which the rex, and his consiliarii, and his magistratus, and all Israel that were present, had offered:</p>
<p>I even weighed unto their manus six hundred and fifty talenta of argentum, and in argentum vascula of one hundred talenta, one hundred talenta of aurum;</p>
<p>And twenty vascula of aurum, of a thousand drachmas; and two vascula of faire argentum, precious than gold.</p>
<p>And I said unto them, Ye are sancti unto Deus, the vascula are sancti also; and the argentum and the aurum are voluntas unto Deus of your patres.</p>
<p>Watch ye, and keep them, until ye weigh them before the principes of the sacerdotes, and the Levites, and the principes of the patres of Israel, at Ierusalem, in the tabernacula of the domus of Deus.</p>
<p>So the sacerdotes and the Levites took the ponderation of the argentum and the aurum, and the vascula, to bring them to Ierusalem unto the domus of our Deus.</p>
<p>Now on the twelfth die of the primus mensis, we removed from the flumen of Ahava, to goe unto Ierusalem, and the manus of our Deus was upon us, and he freed us from the manus of the inimicus, and of such as lay in wait by the via.</p>
<p>And we came to Ierusalem, and abode there three dies.</p>
<p>Now on the quartus die was the argentum and the aurum weighed in the domus of our Deus by the manus of Meremoth the filius of Uriah the sacerdos; and with him was Eleazar the filius of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad the filius of Jeshua, and Noadiah the filius of Binnui, Levites;</p>
<p>By number and by ponderation of every thing: and all the ponderation was written at that time.</p>
<p>Also the filii of those that had been in exilium offered burnt sacrificia unto the Deus of Israel, twelve young boves for all Israel, ninety and six arietes, seventy and seven agni, twelve he goats for sinne, all for a burnt sacrificium unto Deus.</p>
<p>And they delivered the edicta of the rex unto his ducem, and to the regis ducem that were beyond the flumen, and they promoted the populus and the domus of Deus.</p>
