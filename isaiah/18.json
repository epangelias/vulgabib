  "Woe to the land shadowing with wings, which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia:",
  "That sendeth ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels of bulrushes upon the waters, saying, Go, ye swift messengers, to a nation scattered and peeled, to a people terrible from their beginning hitherto; a nation metuenda, and trodden down, whose land the rivers have spoiled!",
  "All ye inhabitants of the world, and dwellers on the earth, see ye, when he lifteth up an ensign on the mountains; and when he bloweth a tuba, hear ye.",
  "For so the Lord said unto me, I will take my rest, and I will consider in my dwelling place like a burning heat of sol, and like a cloud of ros in the day of harvest.",
  "For afore the harvest, when the bud is perfect, and the flower is become a maturing grape, he shall both cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks, and take away and cut down the branches.",
  "They shall be left together unto the fowls of the mountains, and to the beasts of the earth: and the fowls shall summer upon them, and all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them.",
  "And it shall be, that the fowls of every wing, and the beasts of the earth, shall be upon them to eat, and to destroy, and there shall be none to fray them away.",
  "In that time shall they give presents unto the Lord of hosts of a people scattered and peeled, and from a people terrible from their beginning hitherto; a nation metuenda, and trodden down, whose land the rivers have spoiled, to the place of the name of the Lord of hosts, the mount Zion."
