  "For behold the 'libellum' of the execratio is put forth upon the face of the whole 'terra', and every 'fur' that stealeth shall be as it were absoltus; and every 'periurus' shall be as it were absoltus.",
  "And I will bring forth it, saith the Lord of the 'coelestia', and it shall enter into the house of the 'fur', and into the house of him that 'periurat' by my nomen",
  "And the 'spiritus' took me up, and brought me unto the portam orientalem of the 'domus' of the Lord, which looketh eastward: and behold at the 'ingressus' of the portam orientalem there were five et viginti homines",
  "And he said unto me, Son of homo, seest thou what they do? even the execrabile enormitates that the 'domus' of 'Israel' committeth here, that I should go far off from my sanctuarium?"
