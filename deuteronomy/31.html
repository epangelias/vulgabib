                    <p>Then Moses went and spake these verba to all Israel.</p>
<p>And he said unto them, I am centum viginti anni old this day; I can no more egredi and ingredi: also the Lord hath said unto me, Transeas non poteris Jordanem hanc.</p>
<p>The Lord thy Deus, he goeth before thee; he shall destroy these gentes before thee, and thou shalt possess them: Jehoshua, he shall go before thee, as the Lord hath spoken.</p>
<p>And the Lord shall do unto them as he did to Sihon and Og, regibus Amoraeorum, and unto terra eorum, whom he destroyed.</p>
<p>And the Lord shall give them up before your faciem, that ye may do unto them according unto all the mandata which I have commanded you.</p>
<p>Be fortes and robur, fear not, nor dread them: for the Lord thy Deus, he it is that goeth with thee; he will not leave thee, nor forsake thee.</p>
<p>And Moses called Jehoshua, and said unto him in the sight of all Israel, Be fortes and robur: for thou must go with this people unto terra, which the Lord hath sworn unto their patres to give them; and thou shalt cause them to hereditare it.</p>
<p>And the Lord, he it is that doth go before thee; he will be with thee, he will not leave thee, nor forsake thee: fear not therefore, nor be dismayed.</p>
<p>And Moses wrote this lex, and delivered it unto the sacerdotes the filii Levi, who bare the arca foederis of the Lord, and unto all the seniores of Israel.</p>
<p>And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of septem anni, in the time of anno remissionis, in the feast of Tabernacles,</p>
<p>When all Israel is come to appear before the Lord thy Deus in the loco quem ipse elegerit, thou shalt reade this lex before all Israel in their aures.</p>
<p>Gather the people together, viri and mulieres, and pueri, and peregrinus qui est intra portas tuas, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear the Lord your Deus, and observe to do all the verba of this lex:</p>
<p>And that their filii, who have not known any thing, may hear, and learn to fear the Lord your Deus, as long as ye live in terra, which ye go over Jordan to possess it.</p>
<p>And the Lord said unto Moses, Behold, thy dies are at an end: call Jehoshua, and stande thou in the tabernaculo ordinis, that I may give him a mandatum. So Moses and Jehoshua went, and stood in the tabernaculo ordinis.</p>
<p>And the Lord appeared in the tabernaculo in columna nubis: and columna nubis stood over the ostium of the tabernaculo.</p>
<p>And the Lord said unto Moses, Behold, thou shalt dormire with thy patres; and this people will rise up, and go a fornicari after deos alienos in terra, into which they go to possess it; and they will forsake me, and break my foedus which I have made with them.</p>
<p>Then my furor shall be kindled against them in die illa, and I will forsake them, and hide my faciem from them, and they shall be devoured, and many calamitates and angustiae shall befall them; so that they will say in die illa, Are these calamitates upon me, because Deus non est inter nos?</p>
<p>And I will sure abscondere my faciem in die illa, propter omnia mala quae fecerunt, quia elegerunt se deos alienos, et servierunt eis.</p>
<p>Now therefore writee ye this canticum for yourselves, and docete it the filii Israel: put it in their os, that this canticum may be a testis for me against the filii Israel.</p>
<p>For when I shall have brought them into terra, quam juravi patribus eorum, flowing with lac and mel: and they shall have eaten, and satiated, and grown crassi, then they shall turn aside after deos alienos, and servient eis, and contemnent me, and break my foedus.</p>
<p>And it shall come to pass, when many evils and angustiae shall befall them, that this canticum shall testificari against them as a testis; for it shall not be oblitus out of the os of their semen, for I know their ingenium, and quod cogitent hodie, antequam eos introducam in terram quam juravi.</p>
<p>So Moses wrote this canticum the same day, and taught it the filii Israel.</p>
<p>And he gave Jehoshua filium Nun a mandatum, and said, Be fortes and robur: for thou shalt bring the filii Israel into terram, quam juravi eis: and I will be with thee.</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when Moses finished writing the verba of this lex in libro, until they were consummati,</p>
<p>That Moses commanded the Levites, who bare the arca foederis of the Lord, saying, Take this lex, and put it in the latere of the arca foederis of the Lord your Deus, that it may be there as a testis against thee.</p>
<p>For I know thy rebellion, and thy durum collem: behold, while I am yet vivus with you this day, ye have been rebellious against the Lord; how much more after my mortem?</p>
<p>Gather unto me all the seniores of your tribus, and your magistratus, that I may speake these verba in their aures, and invoke coelum and terram to testificari against them.</p>
<p>For I know that after my mortem ye will sure corrumpi, and turn aside from via quam praecepi vobis; and evil will befall you in novissimo dierum, because ye will do evil in the sight of the Lord, to provoke him to ira with the opera manuum vestrarum.</p>
<p>And Moses spake in the aures of the whole congregation of Israel the verba of this canticum, until their finis.</p>
