                    <p>Thou shalt not sacrifice unto the Lord thy God any bullock, or sheep, wherein is blemish, or any evilfavouredness: for that is an abomination unto the Lord thy God.</p>
<p>If there be found among you, within any of thy gates which the Lord thy God giveth thee, man or woman, that hath wrought wickedness in the sight of the Lord thy God, in transgressing his covenant,</p>
<p>And hath gone and served other deities, and worshipped them, either the sol, or the luna, or any of the caelum, which I have not commanded;</p>
<p>And it be told thee, and thou hast heard of it, and enquired diligently, and, behold, it be true, and the thing certain, that such abomination is wrought in Israel:</p>
<p>Then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman, which have committed that wicked thing, unto thy gates, even that man or that woman, and shalt stone them with lapides until they die.</p>
<p>At the mouth of two testes, or three testes, shall he that is worthy of death be put to death; but at the mouth of one testis he shall not be put to death.</p>
<p>The manus of the testes shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterward the manus of all the people. So thou shalt put the malum away from among you.</p>
<p>If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke, being matters of controversy within thy gates: then shalt thou arise, and get thee up into the place which the Lord thy God shall choose;</p>
<p>And thou shalt come unto the sacerdotes the Levites, and unto the iudex that shall be in those days, and enquire; and they shall shew thee the sentence of judgment:</p>
<p>And thou shalt do according to the sentence, which they of that place which the Lord shall choose shall shew thee; and thou shalt observe to do according to all that they inform thee:</p>
<p>According to the sentence of the lex which they shall teach thee, and according to the iudicium which they shall tell thee, thou shalt do: thou shalt not decline from the sentence which they shall shew thee, to the right hand, nor to the left.</p>
<p>And the man that will do presumptuously, and will not hearken unto the sacerdote that standeth to minister there before the Lord thy God, or unto the iudex, even that man shall die: and thou shalt put away the malum from Israel.</p>
<p>And all the people shall hear, and fear, and do no more presumptuously.</p>
<p>When thou art come unto the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee, and shalt possess it, and shalt dwell therein, and shalt say, I will set a king over me, like as all the gentes that are about me;</p>
<p>Thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee, whom the Lord thy God shall choose: one from among thy brethren shalt thou set king over thee: thou mayest not set a stranger over thee, which is not thy frater.</p>
<p>Only he shall not multiply equos to himself, nor cause the people to return to Aegyptum, to the end that he should multiply equos: forasmuch as the Lord hath said unto you, Ye shall henceforth return no more that way.</p>
<p>Neither shall he multiply uxores to himself, that his cor may turn not aside: neither shall he greatly multiply argentum and aurum.</p>
<p>And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the solium of his regnum, that he shall write him a copy of this lex in a book out of that which is before the sacerdotes the Levites:</p>
<p>And it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the dies of his vita: that he may learn to fear the Lord his God, to keep all the words of this lex and these statuta, to do them:</p>
<p>That his cor be not lifted up above his brethren, and that he turn not aside from the commandment, to the right hand, or to the left: to the end that he may prolong his dies in his regnum, he, and his filii, in the midst of Israel.</p>
