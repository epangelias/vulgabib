                    <p>And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the plains of Moab on this side Iordan by Iericho verus solis occasum.</p>
<p>And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.</p>
<p>And Moab feared the people exceedingly, because they were multus, and Moab was in angustia because of the children of Israel.</p>
<p>And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Nunc shall this congregation lingo all that are about us, as the bos taurus linquit the herb of the field, until nothing is left.</p>
<p>And Balak the son of Zippor was rex Moab at that time.</p>
<p>And he sent messengers unto Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor, which is by the flumen Euphrates, unto the terra filiorum suorum, to call him, saying, Ecce populus qui egressus est de Aegypto, operit superficiem terrae, et inhabitant contra me.</p>
<p>Nunc veni, et maledic populo huic, quia fortis est quam ego, si forte possim percutere eum, et eicere eum de terra, quae dedit mihi.</p>
<p>And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian went cum mercede in manu sua, and they came unto Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak.</p>
<p>And he said unto them, Manete hic nocte, and I shall know quid loquatur Dominus ad me.</p>
<p>And the principes Moab and the principes of Midian abode with Balaam.</p>
<p>And Deus venit ad eum, and said, Who are these homines apud te?</p>
<p>And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, rex Moab, hath sent unto me, saying,</p>
<p>Behold, there is a populus come out of Aegyptus, which covereth the facies terrae, come now, curse me them, peradventure I shall be able to smite them, and eicere eum.</p>
<p>And Deus said unto Balaam, Non vadas cum eis, nec maledicas populo, quia benedictus est.</p>
<p>And Balaam rose up in the mane, and said unto the principes of Balak, Go unto your dominus, quia refugit me Dominus, ut non irem vobiscum.</p>
<p>And the principes Moab rose up, and came unto Balak, and said, Balaam refugit ire nobiscum.</p>
<p>And Balak misit rursum principes maiores, et honoratiores quam priores.</p>
<p>And they came unto Balaam, and said unto him, Sic dicit Balak the son of Zippor, Noli obsequi recusare veniendo ad me,</p>
<p>Quia honoravi te, and whatsoever thou sayest unto me, I will do it, unto the maximum.</p>
<p>And Balaam responded, and said unto the servos of Balak, Si daret mihi Balak plenum domus suae argenti et auri, non potero transgredi iussum Domini Dei mei, ut faciam parvum aut magnum.</p>
<p>Nunc igitur, manete hic vos quoque nocte, and I shall scire quid addat Dominus sermoni suo, quod loquetur in me.</p>
<p>And Deus venit ad Balaam nocte, and said unto him, Si venerunt vocare te homines isti, surge, and vade cum eis, sed verbum quod ego loquar in te, hoc facies.</p>
<p>And Balaam rose up in the mane, and saddled his asinus, and went cum principibus Moab.</p>
<p>And the anger of Deus was kindled, quod ivisset, and angelus Domini stetit in via adversus eum, et asinus tres vice vidit angelum Domini stantem in via.</p>
<p>And the asinus declinavit ab ea, and abiit per agrum, and the virus percussit asinum, ut reduceret eum in viam.</p>
<p>And angelus Domini stetit in angusto, ubi non erat spatium evadendi, nec ad dexteram, nec ad sinistram.</p>
<p>And asinus vidit angelum Domini, et declinavit ad murum, and conterivit pedem viri in muro, and he smote him rursum.</p>
<p>And angelus Domini transivit, and stetit in angusto loco, ubi non poterat evadere, nec ad dexteram, nec ad sinistram.</p>
<p>And asinus vidit angelum Domini, and prostravit se in terra, and the virus iratus percussit asinum cum virga.</p>
<p>And aperuit Dominus os asini, and illo locuto, Dixit ad Balaam, Quid feci tibi, quia percussisti me hac vice tertio?</p>
<p>And Balaam said unto the asinus, Quia ridicule fecisti adversus me, et si haberem in manu mea gladium, nunc occidissem te.</p>
<p>And the asinus said unto Balaam, Nonne sum asinus tuus, qui te portavi semper usque in diem hanc, et numquam facio adversus te, et tibi fidus sum?</p>
<p>Et dixit, Non.</p>
<p>Tunc aperuit Dominus oculos Balaam, et vidit angelum Domini stantem in via, et gladium evaginatum in manu sua, et incurvavit se, et adoravit in terra.</p>
<p>And the angelus Domini dixit ad eum, Cur percussisti asinum tuum hac vice tertio, ecce ego exivi ut adversarer tibi, quia perverse videtur ante me via tua.</p>
<p>And Balaam said unto the angelus Domini, Peccavi, quia nescivi te stare contra me in via, nunc si molestus sum tibi, revertar.</p>
<p>And the angelus Domini said unto Balaam, Vade cum viris, sed verbum quod ego loquar in te, id loqueris.</p>
<p>And Balaam went cum principibus, and Balak went to meet him unto the flumen Arnon, and in extremis finibus terrae sua.</p>
<p>And Balak said unto Balaam, Nonne miseram ad te per nuntios, vocare te ad me, quare non venisti ad me, nonne potens sum promovere te?</p>
<p>And Balaam said unto Balak, Ecce veni ad te, nunc autem si potens es facere quidquid vis, audi sermonem meum.</p>
<p>And Balaam went cum Balak, and venit ad civitatem in Arnon, which is in extremo finibus terrae sua.</p>
<p>And Balak immolavit boves, and arietes, and misit ad Balaam, et principibus qui venerant cum eo.</p>
<p>And the mane Balaam dixit ad Balak, Aedifica mihi hic septem altaria, et para mihi hic septem boves, et septem arietes.</p>
<p>And Balak fecit sicut dixerat Balaam, and they offered a bovem, and an arietem super altare.</p>
<p>And Balaam said unto Balak, Stans in holocaustum tuum, vadam ego, si forte apparuerit mihi Deus, and quidquid ostenderit mihi, tibi renuntiabo.</p>
<p>And he went in solitudinem, and Deus venit ad eum.</p>
<p>And Balaam dixit ad Deus, Aedificavi septem altaria, and I offered a bovem, and an arietem super altare.</p>
<p>Then the Deus put a verbum in Balaam's os, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus shalt thou speak.</p>
<p>And he returned unto him, and ecce, he stetit super holocaustum suum, and principes Moab cum eo, and Balak dixit ad eum, Quid locutus est Dominus?</p>
<p>And he took up his parabola, and said, Surge, Balak, and audi, attende mihi, fili Zippor.</p>
<p>Deus non est homo, ut mentiatur, neque filius hominis, ut paeniteat eum, dixitne, et non faciet, locutusne, et non implebit?</p>
<p>Ecce, venit benedictio, et ego aperire os non valeo, neque potero contradictio.</p>
<p>Non videbit in Iacob iniquitatem, neque aspiciet in Israel laborem.</p>
<p>Dominus Deus eorum est cum eis, and clamor regis in eis.</p>
<p>Deus eduxit eos de Aegypto, virtus cervi illis.</p>
<p>Quia non est augurium in Iacob, neque divinatio in Israel, nunc videbitur quid Dominus fecerit.</p>
<p>Ecce, populus sicut leaena consurgit, and se levabit sicut leo, non dormiet donec devoret praedam suam, et bibet sanguinem occisorum.</p>
<p>And Balak said unto Balaam, Quare non maledicis eis?</p>
<p>And Balaam responded, and said unto Balak, Numquid non verba, quae mittit Dominus in os meum, haec loquor?</p>
<p>And Balak said unto him, Veni mecum in alium locum, unde te videas partem eorum, et omnem videas, sed partem tantum, et maledic eis mihi inde.</p>
<p>And he took him unto the terra in sumitate Phogor, which looketh toward Iesimmon, and built seven altaria.</p>
<p>And he said unto him, Fac holocaustum hic in altare septem boves, and septem arietes, as yesterday.</p>
<p>And Balaam said unto Balak, Fac sicut dixi, and he offered a bovem, and an arietem super altare.</p>
<p>And Balaam vidit, quod placuerit Domino benedicere Israel, and he went not as the former times to seek occasions, but directing his faciem versus desertum.</p>
<p>And he lift up his oculus, and saw Israel tenta in ordine, per tribus suas, and the Spiritus Domini was in eo.</p>
<p>And he took up his parabola, and said, Dicit Balaam filius Beor, dicit virum, cuius apertum est oculus.</p>
<p>Dicit audientem sermones Dei, qui visionem Omnipotentis videbit, qui cadit, et aperitur oculus eius.</p>
<p>Video eum, sed non modo, intueor eum, sed non prope, ascendit stella e Iacob, and surgit virga a Israel, and percussit in tempus cornua Moab, and destruet omnes filios Seth.</p>
<p>And Edom shall be a possessio, Seir also shall be a possessio to his enemies, and Israel shall do valiantly.</p>
<p>Out of Iacob shall come he that shall destroy him that remaineth of the civitas.</p>
<p>And he looked on Amalech, and took up his parabola, and said, Amalech princeps gentium, sed in novissimo deletio eorum.</p>
<p>And he looked on the Cinaei, and took up his parabola, and said, Robustus est locus eorum, in petra collocavit domum suam.</p>
<p>Et sita est domus eorum in petra, sed exaltabitur, quod sit in aeternum, et si bene disponeretur, quod usque ad mortem.</p>
<p>That which Israel shall do, non est qui possit ei contradicere.</p>
<p>Non videbitur in Iacob iniquitas, neque aspicietur labor in Israel, Dominus eorum Deus cum eis, and clamor regis in eis.</p>
<p>Deus qui eduxit eos de Aegypto, virtus cervi illis,</p>
<p>Quia non est augurium in Iacob, neque divinatio in Israel, tempus nunc videbitur, quid faciat Deus.</p>
<p>Ecce, populus sicut leaena consurgit, and se levabit sicut leo, non dormiet donec devoret praedam suam, and bibet sanguinem occisorum.</p>
<p>And he looked on the Aquilon, and took up his parabola, and said, Out of Aquilon veniet timor, and non erit qui effugiat.</p>
<p>He shall destroy him that cometh against him, and he shall pursue his enemies, and he shall not spare, and he shall pursue him in gladio.</p>
<p>And he beheld the Assyrrios, and took up his parabola, and said, Asshur in robore, sed et in labores suis, and non erit qui effugiat.</p>
<p>And the Assyrius shall destroy him that cometh against him, and he shall pursue his enemies, and he shall not spare, and he shall pursue him in gladio.</p>
<p>And he beheld the Aethiopes, and took up his parabola, and said, Aethiopia in manu eius, and he shall destroy him that cometh against him, and he shall not spare, and he shall pursue him in gladio.</p>
<p>And he beheld the Hevaei, and took up his parabola, and said, Hevaei in manu eius, and he shall destroy him that cometh against him, and he shall not spare, and he shall pursue him in gladio.</p>
<p>And he beheld the Sarraceni, and took up his parabola, and said, Sarraceni in manu eius, and he shall destroy him that cometh against him, and he shall not spare, and he shall pursue him in gladio.</p>
<p>And he beheld the Nabathaei, and took up his parabola, and said, Nabathaei in manu eius, and he shall destroy him that cometh against him, and he shall not spare, and he shall pursue him in gladio.</p>
<p>And Balaam rose up, and returned unto his locum, and Balak also went unto his locum.</p>
