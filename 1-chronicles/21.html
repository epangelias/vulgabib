                    <p>And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to numerare Israel.</p>
<p>And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, 'Go, numerate Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring the numerus to me, that I may know it.'</p>
<p>And Joab answered, 'The Lord make his populus a hundred times so many more as they be: but, my lord the king, are they not all my lord's servi? why then doth my lord require this thing? why will he be to Israel for peccatum?'</p>
<p>Nevertheless the king's verbum prevailed against Joab: wherefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>And Joab gave the numerus of the populorum to David: and all Israel were a thousand thousand and a hundred thousand homines, that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred seventy thousand viri, that drew sword.</p>
<p>But Levi and Benjamin numerare he did not among them: for the king's verbum was abomination to Joab.</p>
<p>And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel.</p>
<p>And David said unto God, 'I have sinned greatly, in that I have done this thing: but now, I beseech thee, take away the iniquitas of thy servi; for I have done very foolishly.'</p>
<p>And the Lord spake unto Gad, David's propheta, saying, 'Go and tell David, saying, Thus saith the Lord, I offer thee three things: choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.'</p>
<p>So Gad came to David, and said unto him, and said unto him, 'Thus saith the Lord, Choose thee, either three anni of famis, or three mensis to be destroyed before thy foes, while that the gladius of thine enemies overtaketh thee; or else three dies of the gladius of the Lord, even the pestilentia in the land, and the angel of the Lord destroying throughout all the coasts of Israel.' Now therefore advise thyself what word I shall bring again to him that sent me.</p>
<p>And David said unto Gad, 'I am in a great strait: let me fall now into the manus of the Lord; for his misericordiaes are very great: and let me not fall into the manus of hominem.'</p>
<p>So the Lord sent a pestilentia upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed: and there died of the populus from Dan even to Beersheba seventy thousand viri.</p>
<p>And when the angel stretched out his manus upon Jerusalem to destroy it, the Lord repented him of the malum, and said to the angel that destroyed the populum, 'It is sufficient: stay now thine manus.' And the angel of the Lord was by the threshingfloor of Araunah the Jebusite.</p>
<p>And David spake unto the Lord when he saw the angel that smote the populum, and said, 'Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly: but these sheep, what have they done? let thine ira, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father's domus.'</p>
<p>And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, 'Go up, erect an altare unto the Lord in the threshingfloor of Araunah the Jebusite.'</p>
<p>And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the Lord commanded.</p>
<p>And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servi coming on towards him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king on his facies upon the ground.</p>
<p>And Araunah said, 'Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servi?' And David said, 'To buy the threshingfloor of thee, to build an altare unto the Lord, that the pestilentia may be stayed from the populus.'</p>
<p>And Araunah said unto David, 'Let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto him: behold, here be boves for a holocaust, and threshing instruments and other instruments of the boves for lignum.'</p>
<p>All these things did Araunah, as a king, give unto the king. And Araunah said unto the king, 'The Lord thy God accept thee.'</p>
<p>And the king said unto Araunah, 'Nay; but I will surely buy it of thee at a pretium: neither will I offer holocausts unto the Lord my God of that which doth cost me nothing.' So David bought the threshingfloor and the boves for fifty shekels of argentum.</p>
<p>And David built there an altare unto the Lord, and offered holocausts and pacificas: so the Lord was propitiated for the land, and the pestilentia was stayed from Israel.</p>
