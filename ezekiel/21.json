  "And the word of the Dominus came unto me in the anno of the captivitas of the king, saying,",
  "Son of homo, set thy facies against the montes of Israel, and prophesy against them,",
  "And say, Ye montes of Israel, haec dicit Dominus Deus; Behold, I will take the gladius out of his loculus, the gladius of the occisor, and will make it to cease;",
  "There shall be no more of the occisor, and I will deliver the populus out of the manu of the violenti, and will make them to be secure in terra,",
  "And I will give them unitas in terra, and I will multiply them, and will set my sanctuarium in medio of them for evermore;",
  "And my tabernaculum shall be with them, and I will be Deus unto them, and they shall be populus unto me;",
  "And the gentes shall know that I am the Dominus, the Sanctus of Israel, when I shall be sanctificatus in them before the oculi of the gentes.",
  "And the filii of Israel shall dwell in terra, which I gave unto their patres, and they shall edificare mihi aedes, and I will be Deus unto them, and they shall be populus unto me;",
  "And I will not hide my facies from them any more, for I have poured out my Spirit upon the domus of Israel, saith the Dominus Deus.",
  "Thus saith the Dominus Deus; I will yet for this be inquired of by the domus of Israel, to do it for them, I will increase them with homines like a flock.",
  "As a flock in the dies of the festa, so shall the desolata civitas be replenished with homines, and they shall know that I am the Dominus.",
  "The word of the Dominus came again unto me, saying;",
  "Also, thou son of homo, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Dominus Deus; Say, A gladius, a gladius is sharpened, and also furbished;",
  "To make a sore slaughter, it is furbished that it may glitter, and it is sharpened to make a great caedes, to cause destruction by reason of the caligo of the filius of the vir, with all the tribus of them;",
  "Therefore thus saith the Dominus Deus; Cry and howl, for the gladius shall come upon my populus, it is come upon all the principes of Israel, terrors by reason of the gladius shall be upon my populus, saith the Dominus Deus.",
  "Smite therefore upon thy thigh, for the gladius is come, and for the great caedes which is among them;",
  "For it is a tentatio, and what shall be if the gladius contemn the sceptrem? it shall not be, saith the Dominus Deus.",
  "Thou therefore, son of homo, prophesy, and smite thy manus together, and let the gladius be doubled the third time, the gladius of the mortis, it is the gladius of the magna caedes, which compasseth them about;",
  "That their cor may fail, and the ruinae be multiplied, I have set the nuditas of the gladio, all their fortitudines shall perish, they are given into the manus of the occisor,",
  "Prophesy therefore thou son of homo, say, Thus saith the Dominus; Say, A gladius, a gladio, it is sharpened, and also furbished;",
  "To make a sore slaughter, and it is furbished that it may glitter, and it is sharpened to make a great caedes, to cause destruction by reason of the caligo of the filius of the vir, with all the tribus of them;",
  "Set thee upon the via, son of homo, before them, and smite upon thy manus, and let the gladius be doubled the third time, the gladius of the magna caedes, it is the gladius of the magna caedes which compasseth them about;",
  "That their cor may fail, and the ruinae be multiplied, I have set the nuditas of the gladio, all their fortitudines shall perish, they are given into the manus of the occisor;",
  "Or thus, son of homo, thus saith the Dominus Deus; Say, Shall we not inquire of the idolums of the gentes, to know what they are;",
  "Live, saith the Dominus Deus; They shall know that I am the Dominus when I shall have executed iudiciums in them, behold for iudiciums art thou come, saith the Dominus Deus;",
  "And behold another gladius, sharpened and taken in manus to make a great caedes, to cause destruction by reason of the caligo of the filius of the vir;",
  "It is given to be furbished that it may glitter, and it is sharpened to make a great caedes, to cause destruction by reason of the caligo of the filius of the vir, with all the tribus of them;",
  "I have set the nuditas of the gladio, all their fortitudines shall perish, they are given into the manus of the occisor;",
  "And behold another gladio, sharpened and taken in manus to make a great caedes, to cause destruction by reason of the caligo of the filius of the vir;",
  "It is given to be furbished that it may glitter, and it is sharpened to make a great caedes, to cause destruction by reason of the caligo of the filius of the vir, with all the tribus of them;",
  "I will pour out mine indignatio upon thee, I will blow against thee in the flamma of my ira, and deliver thee into the manus of homines bruti, skilful to destroy;",
  "Thou shalt be for caloris, and thy sanguis shall be in medio of the terra, thou shalt not be remembered, for I the Dominus have spoken it.",
  "And the word of the Dominus came unto me, saying;",
  "Also, thou son of homo, thus saith the Dominus Deus; Say, What is the lignum of the vine more than any lignum, which is among the ligna of the silva;",
  "Shall lignum be taken thereof to make any opus, or will men take a spinum thereof to hang any vasculum thereon;",
  "Behold, it is cast into the ignis for caloris, and the flamma consumeth both ends of it, and the medio of it is burned, is it meet for any opus;",
  "Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no opus, how much less shall it be meet yet for any opus, when the ignis hath consumeth it, and it is burned;",
  "Therefore thus saith the Dominus Deus; As the lignum of the vine among the ligna of the silva, which I have given to the ignis for caloris, so will I give the inhabitants of Ierusalem;",
  "And I will set my facies against them, they shall go out from one ignis, and another ignis shall consumeth them, and ye shall know that I am the Dominus, when I set my manus upon them;",
  "And I will make the terra desolata, because they have committed scelus, saith the Dominus Deus."
