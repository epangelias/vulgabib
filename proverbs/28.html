                    <p>1 A falsus witness shall not be unpunished, and a lying tongue shall be destroyed.</p>
<p>2 When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn.</p>
<p>3 Whoso loveth sapientia is a lover of his own animus: but he that keepeth scientia shall find good.</p>
<p>4 The rex that faithfully judgeth the pauper, his thronus shall be established for ever.</p>
<p>5 They that sunt justi shall be delivered, but the unjust shall be taken in their own malitia.</p>
<p>6 The just shall be recompensed in the terra, but the wicked shall be destroyed in the same.</p>
<p>7 The just considereth the causa of the pauper: but the impious hath no respect unto scientia.</p>
<p>8 Scornful men bring a civitas into contempt: but wise men turn away wrath.</p>
<p>9 If a sapiens man contendeth with a stultus, whether he rage or laugh, there is no rest.</p>
<p>10 The sanguis of the just is precious in the oculi of the Domini: and he spareth their animus.</p>
<p>11 The just man is merciful, and lendeth: and his seminarium is directed by misericordia.</p>
<p>12 He that exalteth his mens, shall be destroyed; and he that is humilis in spiritus, shall obtain honor.</p>
<p>13 He that covereth his peccata shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and relinquit them, shall have misericordia.</p>
<p>14 Happy is the homo that feareth semper: but he that hardeneth his cor, shall fall into malum.</p>
<p>15 As a roaring lea, and a chasing bear; so is a rex that is without prudentia.</p>
<p>16 The prince that wanteth intellectus shall be multiplied in calumnia: but he that hateth avaritia shall prolong his dies.</p>
<p>17 A homo that doth violence to the sanguis of any person, shall flee to the sepulchrum, that no man may lay hands on him.</p>
<p>18 Whoso walketh in integritas shall be saved: but he that is perverse in his via, shall fall at unawares.</p>
<p>19 He that tilleth his terra shall have plenty of panis: but he that followeth vanitates shall have poverty enough.</p>
<p>20 A fidelis man shall abound with benediction: but he that maketh haste to be rich, shall not be innocent.</p>
<p>21 To have respect of personas is not bonus: for a man will transgress for a piece of panis.</p>
<p>22 He that hasteth to be rich, hath an oculus evil: and considereth not that paupertas shall come upon him.</p>
<p>23 He that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favor than he that flattereth with lingua.</p>
<p>24 Whoso robbeth his pater or mater, and saith, It is no peccatum; the same is the companion of a homo perditus.</p>
<p>25 He that is proud in cor, shall stir up contention: but he that putteth his trust in the Domini, shall be fed.</p>
<p>26 He that trusteth in his own cor is a stultus: but whoso walketh in sapientia shall be delivered.</p>
<p>27 He that giveth unto the pauper shall not lack: but he that hideth his oculi shall have many maledictions.</p>
<p>28 When the impious are multiplied, transgressions are multiplied: but the just shall see their ruina.</p>
