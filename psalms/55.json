  "Give ear to my prayer, O Deus, and hide not thyself from my supplication.",
  "Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make a noise;",
  "Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me.",
  "My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death are fallen upon me.",
  "Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me.",
  "And I said, Oh that I had wings like a columba, for then I would fly away, and be at rest.",
  "Lo, then I would wander far off, and remain in the wilderness. Selah.",
  "I would hasten my escape from the windy tempest and tempest.",
  "Destroy, O Deus, and divide their lingua: for I have seen violence and strife in the city.",
  "Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it.",
  "Wickedness is in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart not from her streets.",
  "For it was not an inimicus that reproached me; then I could have borne it: neither was it one that hated me that did magnify himself against me; then I would have hid myself from him:",
  "But it was thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance.",
  "We took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the domus Dei in company.",
  "Let death seize upon them, and let them go down quick into infernus: for wickedness is in their habitations, and among them.",
  "As for me, I will call upon Deus; and the Deus shall save me.",
  "Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud: and he shall hear my voice.",
  "He hath delivered my anima in pace from the battle that was against me: for there were many with me.",
  "Deus shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old. Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not Deus.",
  "He hath put forth his manus against such as be at pace with him: he hath broken his foedus.",
  "The words of his os are smoother than oleum: yet are they daggers.",
  "Cast thy burden upon Deus, and he shall sustain thee: he shall never suffer the justus to be moved.",
  "But thou, O Deus, shalt bring them down into the puteus of destruction: men of sanguis and deceit shall not live out half their dies; but I will trust in thee."
