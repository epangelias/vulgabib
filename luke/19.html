                    <p>And it came to pass, that as Jesus drew near to Iericho, caecus quidam, a certain blind man, sat by the way side, mendicans begging.</p>
<p>And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked, Quid sit hoc? what this meant.</p>
<p>And they told him, that Iesus Nazarenus passeth by.</p>
<p>And he cried, saying, Iesu, Fili David, have mercy on me.</p>
<p>And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more, Thou Fili David, have mercy on me.</p>
<p>And Iesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him, Quid tibi vis faciam? what wilt thou that I shall do unto thee?</p>
<p>And he said, Domine, ut videam: that I may receive my sight.</p>
<p>And Iesus said unto him, Recede, vide: thy faith hath saved thee.</p>
<p>And immediately he received visum, sight, and followed him, glorificans Deum: and all the people, when they saw it, gave laudem Deo.</p>
<p>And Iesus entered and passed through Iericho;</p>
<p>And, behold, there was a vir, man, named Zacchaeus, which was the princeps of the publicani, and he was dives, rich.</p>
<p>And he sought to see Iesum, qui esset: who he was;</p>
<p>And could not for the turba, multitude, because he was parvus, stature.</p>
<p>And he ran before, and ascendit, climbed up into a sycomorus, tree to see him: for he was to pass that way.</p>
<p>And when Iesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said unto him, Zacchaeus, festina, make haste, and descend; to day I must abide in domo tua, thy house.</p>
<p>And he made haste, and came down, and received him iucundus, joyfully.</p>
<p>And when they saw it, they all murmurabant, murmured, saying, That he was gone to be hospes, guest, with a homo, man who is peccator, sinner.</p>
<p>And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto Iesu, Ecce, behold, Domine, the half of my bona, goods I give to pauperes, the poor;</p>
<p>And if I have calumniatus, wronged any man of any thing, I restore him quadruplum, fourfold.</p>
<p>And Iesus said unto him, Hodie salus huic domui facta est: this day is salvation come to this house;</p>
<p>Forsomuch as he also is Filius Abrahae.</p>
<p>For the Filius hominis came to quaerere, and salvare that which was perditum, lost.</p>
<p>And as they heard these things, he added also a parabolam, parable, because he was prope, near to Ierusalem, and because they thought that the regnum Dei should forthwith apparebit, appear;</p>
<p>He said therefore, Homo quidam nobilis, A certain nobleman went into a provinciam, far country to receive for himself a regnum, and to return.</p>
<p>And he called his servos, servants, and delivered them argentum, money, and said unto them, Negotiamini, Occupy till I come.</p>
<p>And his civitas, citizens hated him, and sent a legatio, legation after him, saying, Nolumus illum regnare, We will not have this man to reign over us.</p>
<p>And it came to pass, that when he was reverturus, returned, having received the regnum, he commanded his servos, whom he had given the argentum, to be called unto him, that he might scire, know how much every man had negociatus, gained.</p>
<p>And the primus, first came, saying, Domine, thy pondus, pound hath lucratus, gained decem alia, ten pounds.</p>
<p>And he said unto him, Euge, bone servus, Well, thou good servant: because thou hast been fidelis, faithful in minimo, that which is least, have thou potestatem, power over decem civitates, ten cities.</p>
<p>And the secundus, second came, saying, Domine, thy pondus hath lucratus, gained quinque alia, five pounds.</p>
<p>And he said also to him, Et tu esto super quinque civitates, And thou also be over five cities.</p>
<p>And another came, saying, Domine, behold, thy pondus, which I have servatus, kept in sudario, a napkin:</p>
<p>For I feared thee, quia es homo austerus, for thou art an austere man: thou takest up what thou layedst not down, and reapest what thou didst not seminare, sow.</p>
<p>And he saith unto him, De proprio ore te iudico, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, thou servo prudens, thou wicked servant.</p>
<p>Thou knewest that I am homo austerus, an austere man, taking up what I laid not down, and reaping that which I did not seminare, sow;</p>
<p>Then wherefore gavisti non argentum meum in mensam, didst not thou put my money into the bank, that at my venire, coming I might have exacted it cum usura, with usury?</p>
<p>And he said unto them that stood by, Tollite ab illo pondus, Take from him the pound, and give it to him that hath decem alia, the ten pounds.</p>
<p>For I say unto you, That unto every one which hath, dabitur, shall be given: and from him that hath not, shall be taken away, et quod habet, even that which he hath.</p>
<p>But those mine enemies, which would not that I should regnare, reign over them, adducite illi hic, bring them hither, and interficite, slay them before me.</p>
<p>And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascendens in Ierusalem.</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when he was prope, near to Bethphage and Bethania, at the mons Oliveti, mount of Olives, he sent two of his discipuli, disciples,</p>
