                    <p>O give thanks unto Dominus, for he is bonus, for his misericordia endureth for ever.</p>
<p>Let the redeemed of Dominus say so, whom he hath redeemed from the manus of the enemy;</p>
<p>And gathered them out of the terrae, from the orient and from the occidens, from the septentrio and from the meridies.</p>
<p>They wandered in solitudine, in deserto viae; they found not civitas of habitation.</p>
<p>Famished and thirsty, their anima fainted in them.</p>
<p>Then they cried unto Dominus in their tribulatio, and he delivered them out of their angustia;</p>
<p>And he led them forth by rectus via, that they might go to civitas of habitation.</p>
<p>Oh that men would praise Dominus for his misericordia, and for his mirabilia that he doth for the filii of homines!</p>
<p>For he satisfieth the anima that is famished, and filleth the anima that is vacuus with bonus.</p>
<p>Such as sit in tenebrae and in umbra mortis, being bound in afflictio and ferreus;</p>
<p>Because they rebelled against the verba of Dominus, and contemned the consilium of the Altissimus;</p>
<p>Therefore he brought down their cor by labour; they fell down, and there was none to help.</p>
<p>Then they cried unto Dominus in their tribulatio, and he saved them out of their angustia;</p>
<p>He brought them out of tenebrae and the umbra mortis, and brake their vincula in sunder.</p>
<p>Oh that men would praise Dominus for his misericordia, and for his mirabilia that he doth for the filii of homines!</p>
<p>For he hath broken the portae of ferreus, and cut the barras of ferreus in sunder.</p>
<p>Fools because of their transgressio, and because of their iniquitates, are afflicted.</p>
<p>Their anima abhorreth all cibus, and they draw near unto portae of mortis.</p>
<p>Then they cry unto Dominus in their tribulatio, and he saveth them out of their angustia;</p>
<p>He sent his verbum, and healed them, and delivered them from their sepulchra.</p>
<p>Oh that men would praise Dominus for his misericordia, and for his mirabilia that he doth for the filii of homines!</p>
<p>And let them offer sacrificia of laudis, and declare his opera with gaudeo;</p>
<p>That they may go to mare in navibus, that do business in many aquae;</p>
<p>These see the opera of Dominus, and his mirabilia in the profundum.</p>
<p>For he commandeth, and raiseth the ventus of tempestas, which lift up the undae thereof.</p>
<p>They mount up to caelum, they go down again to abyssus; their anima melteth away in malum.</p>
<p>They reel to and fro, and stagger like a ebrius, and are at their wits' end.</p>
<p>Then they cry unto Dominus in their tribulatio, and he bringeth them out of their angustia;</p>
<p>He maketh the tempestas a tranquillus, so that the undae thereof are still.</p>
<p>Then are they gaudeo because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto the haven of their desiderium.</p>
<p>Oh that men would praise Dominus for his misericordia, and for his mirabilia that he doth for the filii of homines!</p>
<p>And let them exalt him in ecclesia of populus, and praise him in sedes of seniores.</p>
<p>He turneth flumina into desertum, and the fontes of aquae into siccitas;</p>
<p>A fruitful terra into salinas, for the malitia of them that dwell therein.</p>
<p>He turneth the desertum into stagna of aquae, and the terra aridus into fontes of aquae;</p>
<p>To make him a civitas of habitation, and to sow the terra with semina;</p>
<p>That they may make fructus in the terra, and have the fructus of their manus.</p>
<p>He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and he suffereth not their iumentum to diminuere.</p>
<p>Again, they are minuere and brought low through oppression, afflictio, and dolor;</p>
<p>He poureth contempt upon principes, and causeth them to err in solitudine, where there is no via.</p>
<p>Yet he saveth the pauper from afflictio, and maketh him familiae like a grex;</p>
<p>The recti shall see it, and be gaudeo; and all iniquitas shall stop her os.</p>
<p>Who is sapiens, and he shall attend to these things, and they shall intelligere the misericordia of Dominus.</p>
