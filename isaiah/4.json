  "In that day septem mulieres shall take hold of one vir, saying, We will eat our own panis, and wear our own vestis: only let us be called by thy nomen, to take away our reproachum.",
  "In that day the planta of the Lord shall be splendidus and gloriosus, and the fructus of the terra shall be excellentissimus and formosus for those that are escaped of Israel.",
  "And it shall come to pass, that he that is left in Zion, and remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called sanctus, even every one that is written among the viventes in Jerusalem:",
  "When the Domine shall have washed away the sordes of the filiae of Zion, and shall have purged the sanguinem of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of iudicium, and by the spirit of ignis.",
  "And the Domine will create upon every locum of mount Zion, and upon her conventus, a nubem and smoke by day, and the splendor of ignis flammas by night: for upon all the gloria shall be a protection.",
  "For above every locum of protection, and above every locum of conventus, shall be a tabernaculum for a umbraculum against tempestas, and for a velamen against imber.",
  "And there shall be a tabernaculum for a velamen against the sol, and for a scutum and buckler against the grandinem and contra sagittas."
