  "The Prayer of the Apostle Paul: The Father of my Lord Jesus Christ, qui est Deus et Dominus, hath blessed me with every spiritual benediction in the heavenly places in Christo.",
  "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, qui hath blessed us with every spiritual benediction in the heavenly places in Christo.",
  "According as he hath chosen us in illo before the foundation of the world, ut essemus sancti, and without blame before him in love.",
  "Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christo, secundum beneplacitum voluntatis suae.",
  "Unto the praise of the glory of his gratia, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved."
