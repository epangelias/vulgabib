                    <p>For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins: who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the via, because he himself also is compassed with infirmitas.</p>
<p>Who can non sine timore offer the donum, who hath need, as we, of quotidie oblationem for peccata.</p>
<p>For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from peccatores, and made higher than the caelos;</p>
<p>Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrificium for his own peccata, and then for the people's: for this he did once, quando se ipsum obtulit.</p>
<p>For the lex maketh men high priests which have infirmitas; but the word of the oath, which was since the lex, maketh the Son, who is perfectus in perpetuum.</p>
<p>And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest: (For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware, and will not repent, Thou art a sacerdos for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)</p>
<p>And forasmuch as is in that better testament, he is the mediator of a melior testament, which was established upon meliora promissa.</p>
<p>For if that prima testament had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the secunda.</p>
<p>For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the dies come, saith the Lord, when I will consummate a novum testamentum with the domus of Israel and the domus of Judah;</p>
<p>Not according to the testamentum that I made with their patres in the die when I took them by the manus to lead them out of the terra of Aegypt; because they continued not in my testamentum, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.</p>
<p>For this is the testamentum that I will make with the domus of Israel after those dies, saith the Lord; I will put my leges into their mens, and write them in their cordibus: and I will be their Deus, and they shall be my populus:</p>
<p>And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his fratrem, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the minimus unto the maximus.</p>
<p>For I will be merciful to their iniquitates, and their peccata and their iniquitates I will remember no more.</p>
<p>In that he saith, A novum testamentum, he hath made the prima old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away.</p>
