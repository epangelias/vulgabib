  "The words of Enoch, a iustus and faithful witness, are these.",
  "Who beheld the vision of the Holy One in the heavens, which the angels showed me, and from whence I heard every word of the Lord.",
  "From that which hath been, and from that which is, and from that which shall be, and from that which is before, I will declare.",
  "The Great and Holy One, qui inhabiteth on high, hath sent unto us His angels, and hath propounded to them, that they should come and testify.",
  "And behold, He cometh with ten thousand of His saints, to execute iudicium upon them, and to destroy the impious, and to contend with all flesh, concerning all the hard and wicked deeds, which they have done, and concerning all the hard and wicked words, which the sinners and impious have spoken against Him.",
  "This is the nativitas of the Book of the words of Enoch.",
  "And it shall be in the consummatio of the days, that the elect shall be in the light of days, and the elect in the light of days shall be inviolable.",
  "And the elect shall be the torches of the righteous and the holy, and the elect shall shine, and the darkness shall depart, which hath been until this time, and the light shall be before them until the endless days, and the number of the days of the righteous shall be without number."
