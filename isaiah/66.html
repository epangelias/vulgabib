                    <p>Thus saith the Lord, The heaven is my throne, and the terra is my footstool: where is the domus that ye build unto me? and where is the locus of my rest?</p>
<p>For all those things hath mine hand made, and all those things have been, saith the Lord: but to this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my verbum.</p>
<p>He that killeth an ox is as if he slew a homo; he that sacrificeth a sheep, as if he cut off a cane's neck; he that offereth an oblation, as if he offered swine's blood; he that burneth incense, as if he blessed an idol. Yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their animus delighteth in their abomination.</p>
<p>I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon them; because when I called, none did respond; when I spake, they did not hear: but they did evil before mine oculi, and chose that in which I delighted not.</p>
<p>Hear the verbum of the Lord, ye that tremble at his verbum; Your fratres that hated you, that cast you out for my nomine's sake, said, Let the Lord be glorified: but he shall appear to your gaudium, and they shall be ashamed.</p>
<p>A voice of clamor from the urbs, a voice from the templum, a voice of the Lord that rendereth retribution to his enemies.</p>
<p>Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her dolor came, she was delivered of a male child.</p>
<p>Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? Shall the terra be made to bring forth in one die, or shall a nation be born at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her filii.</p>
<p>Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? saith the Lord: shall I cause to bring forth, and shut the womb? saith thy Deus.</p>
<p>Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all ye that love her: rejoice for joy with her, all ye that mourn for her:</p>
<p>That ye may suck, and be satisfied with the ubera of her consolation; that ye may milk out, and be delighted with the abundance of her gloria.</p>
<p>For thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a flumen, and the gloria of the gentes like an overflowing torrent: and ye shall suck, ye shall be borne upon the umerus, and dandled upon the genu.</p>
<p>As one whom his mater comforteth, so will I comfort you; and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>And when ye see this, your cor will rejoice, and your ossa shall flourish like an herba: and the manus of the Lord shall be known toward his servi, and his indignatio toward his enemies.</p>
<p>For, behold, the Lord will come with ignis, and his currus like a turbine, to render his ira with indignation, and his reprehension with flammaes of ignis.</p>
<p>For by ignis and by gladius will the Lord judge all caro; and the slain of the Lord shall be many.</p>
<p>They that sanctificabant and purified themselves in the horti behind one tree in the midst, eating swine's flesh, and such abomination, even the talpa and the mustela, shall be consumed together, saith the Lord.</p>
<p>For I know their opera and their cogitationes: it shall come, that I will gather all gentes and linguae: and they shall come, and see my gloria.</p>
<p>And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that escape of them unto the gentes, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the arcus, to Tubal, and Javan, to the insulae afar off, that have not heard my fama, neither have seen my gloria; and they shall declare my gloria among the gentes.</p>
<p>And they shall bring all your fratres for an oblation unto the Lord out of all gentes upon equis, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon mules, and upon dromedaries, to my sanctuarium in the montem of my sanctificatio, saith the Lord, as the filii of Israel bring an oblation in a mundus vessel to the domus of the Lord.</p>
<p>And I will also take of them for sacerdotes and for Levites, saith the Lord.</p>
<p>For as the novus caelum and the nova terra, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the Lord, so shall your semen and your nomine remain.</p>
<p>And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbatum to another, shall all caro come to worship before me, saith the Lord.</p>
<p>And they shall go forth, and look upon the cadavera of the homines that have transgressed against me: for their vermis shall not die, neither shall their ignis be quenched; and they shall be an abomination unto all caro.</p>
