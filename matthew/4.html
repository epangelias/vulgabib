                    <p>Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be temptatus by the diabolus.</p>
<p>And when he had fasted forty dies and forty noctes, he was afterward hungarius.</p>
<p>And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou art the Filius Dei, command that these lapides be made panis.</p>
<p>But he answered and said, It is scriptum, Man shall not live by panis alone, but by omni verbum that proceedeth out of the os Dei.</p>
<p>Then the diabolus taketh him up into the holy civitas, and setteth him on a pinnaculum of the templum.</p>
<p>And saith unto him, If thou art the Filius Dei, cast thyself down: for it is scriptum, He shall give his angelis charge concerning thee: and in their manus they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a lapide.</p>
<p>Jesus said unto him, It is scriptum again, Thou shalt not temptare the Dominus Deus tuus.</p>
<p>Again, the diabolus taketh him up into an exceeding high montem, and showeth him omnes regna mundi, and the gloria of them;</p>
<p>And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and adoreare me.</p>
<p>Then saith Jesus unto him, Begone, Satana: for it is scriptum, Thou shalt adoreare the Dominus Deus tuus, and him only shalt thou servire.</p>
<p>Then the diabolus leaveth him, and, behold, angelis came and ministrated unto him.</p>
<p>Now when Jesus had heard that John was delivered up, he departed into Galileam;</p>
