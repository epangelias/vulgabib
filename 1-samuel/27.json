  "And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul: there is nothing better for me than that I should speedily escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul shall despair of me, to seek me any more in any coast of Israel: so shall I escape out of his hand.",
  "And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men that were with him unto Achish, the son of Maoch, which was king of Gath.",
  "And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's widow.",
  "And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he sought no more again for him.",
  "And David said unto Achish, If I have now found grace in thine eyes, let them give me a place in some town in the country, that I may dwell there: for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee?",
  "Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: wherefore Ziklag pertaineth unto the kings of Judah unto this day.",
  "And the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months.",
  "And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites, and the Gezrites, and the Amalekites: for those nations were of old the inhabitants of the land, as thou goest to Shur, even unto the land of Egypt.",
  "And David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel, and returned, and came to Achish.",
  "And Achish said, Whither have ye made a road to day? And David said, Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the Jerahmeelites, and against the south of the Kenites.",
  "And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring tidings to Gath, saying, Lest they should tell on us, saying, So did David, and so will be his manner all the while he dwelleth in the country of the Philistines.",
  "And Achish believed David, saying, He hath made his people Israel utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant for ever.",
  "Et factum est in diebus illis, et congregati sunt Philisthim, ut venirent et pugnarent contra IsraÃ«l. Et ait Achis ad David, Scias autem tu et populus tuus, quod veniatis mecum in castra, ut pugnemus contra inimicos regis.",
  "And David said, Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying, Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten thousands?",
  "Et audivit Saul, et congregavit populum, et abiit ad occursum David, et ad bellum contra eum.",
  "And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them.",
  "And there went out a champion named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.",
  "And he had an helmet of brass upon his head, and he was armed with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass.",
  "And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of brass between his shoulders.",
  "And the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam; and his spear's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron: and one bearing a shield went before him.",
  "And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto them, Why are ye come out to set your battle in array? am not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me.",
  "If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our servants, and serve us."
