  "For in him dwelleth all the plenitudo of the Deity corporally.",
  "And ye are complete in him, qui est the caput of all principality and potestas:",
  "In quem also ye are circumcised with the circumcisio Christi, in putting off the body of the carne of peccatum, by the circumcision of Christ:",
  "Baptizati in Christo, and clothed with Christum, wherein also ye are risen with Christum through the fides of the operation of Dei, qui raised him from the mortui.",
  "Even when ye were mortui in peccatis, and in the uncircumcision of your carne, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;",
  "Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrario to us, and took it out of the via, nailing it to the cruce;",
  "And having spoiled principality and potestas, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in him.",
  "Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of a festival day, or of the novilunium, or of the sabbatum:",
  "Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christi.",
  "For in him dwelleth all the plenitudo of the Deity corporally.",
  "And ye are complete in him, qui est the caput of all principality and potestas:"
