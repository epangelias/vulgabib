                    <p>Then cometh Iesus from Galilaea to Iordane to be baptized of Ioannes.</p>
<p>But Ioannes forbad him, saying, I haue need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?</p>
<p>And Iesus answering said vnto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becommeth vs to fulfill all iustitia.</p>
<p>Then he suffered him. And Ioannes baptized Iesus, and he tarried behinde in the water: and loe, the Coelum was opened vnto him, and he saw the Spirit of Deus descending like a Columba, and lighting vpon him:</p>
<p>And loe a voyce from Coelum, saying, This is my filius dilectus, in whom I am well pleased.</p>
<p>Then was Iesus led vp of the Spirit into the desert, to be tempted of Sathan.</p>
<p>And when he had fasted fourty dies and fourty noctes, he was afterward hungered.</p>
<p>And when the temptator came to him, he said, If thou be the filius Dei, say that these lapides be made panis.</p>
<p>But he answering said, It is written, Man shall not liue by panis alone, but by omni verbo that proceedeth out of the os of Deus.</p>
<p>Then the diabolus taketh him vp into the Sanctuarium, and setteth him on a pinnaculum of the Sanctuarium,</p>
<p>And saith vnto him, If thou be the filius Dei, mitte te downe: for it is written, He shall giue his Angeli charge concerning thee, and in their manus they shall beare thee vp, lest at any time thou dashest thy ped against a lapide.</p>
<p>Iesus said vnto him, It is written againe, Thou shalt not tempt the Dominum Deus.</p>
<p>Againe the diabolus taketh him vp into an exceeding high montem, and sheweth him all the regna of the mundus, and the gloria of them;</p>
<p>And saith vnto him, All these things will I giue thee, if thou wilt fall downe and worship me.</p>
<p>Then saith Iesus vnto him, Begone Sathan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Dominum Deus, and him onely shalt thou seruice.</p>
<p>Then the diabolus leaueth him: and behold, Angeli came and ministred vnto him.</p>
<p>Now when Iesus had heard that Ioannes was deliuered vp, he departed into Galilaea,</p>
<p>And leauing Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capharnaum, which is vpon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:</p>
<p>That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the propheta, saying,</p>
<p>The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of the sea, beyond Iordane, Galilaea of the Gentiles;</p>
<p>The people which sate in tenebris, saw great lux: and to them which sate in the region and shadow of mors, lux is risen.</p>
<p>From that time Iesus began to preach, and to say, PÅ“nitentiam agite: for the regnum Coelorum is at hand.</p>
<p>And Iesus walking by the sea of Galilaea, saw two brethren, Simon who was called Petrus, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were piscatores.</p>
<p>And he saith vnto them, Follow me, and I will make you piscatores of homines.</p>
<p>And they straightway leauing their retia, followed him.</p>
<p>And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, Iacobus the sonne of Zebedeus, and Iohn his brother, in a nauis with Zebedeus their father, mending their retia: and he called them.</p>
<p>And they immediatly leauing the nauis and their father, followed him.</p>
<p>And Iesus went about all Galilaea, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the euangelium of the regnum, and healing all manner of sordes and infirmitas among the people.</p>
