                    <p>And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went both together into the synagogue of the Iudaei, and so spake, that a great multitude both of the Iudaei and also of the Graeci believed.</p>
<p>But the unbelieving Iudaei stirred up the Gentiles, and made their minds evil affected against the fratres.</p>
<p>Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Dominius, which gave testimonium unto the word of his gratia, and granted signa and prodigia to be done by their hands.</p>
<p>But the multitude of the city was divided: and part held with the Iudaei, and part with the apostoli.</p>
<p>And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and also of the Iudaei with their principes, to use them despitefully, and to stone them,</p>
<p>They were ware of it, and fled unto Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and unto the region that lieth round about:</p>
<p>And there they preached the evangelium to the people that were there.</p>
<p>And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotens in the pedes, being a cripple from his mater's womb, who never had walked:</p>
<p>The same heard Paulus speak: who stedfastly beholding him, and perceiving that he had fiducia to be made whole,</p>
<p>Said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy pedes. And he leaped and walked.</p>
<p>And when the multitude saw what Paulus had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in Lycaonitis, The dii are come down to us in the similitude of homines.</p>
<p>And they called Barnabas Iuppiter, and Paulus Mercurius, because he was the princeps of the oratio.</p>
<p>Then the sacerdos of Iuppiter, which was before their civitas, brought oxen and coronas unto the portae, and would have done sacrificium with the multitude.</p>
<p>Which when the apostoli Barnabas and Paulus heard of, they rent their vestes, and ran in among the people, crying out,</p>
<p>And saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are homines of like passions with you, and preach to you that ye should turn from these vanitates unto the Deus vivus, which made caelum and terram, and mare, and all things that are therein:</p>
<p>Who in temporibus praeteritis suffered all gentes walk in their own via.</p>
<p>Nevertheless he left not himself without testimonium, in that he did beneficia, giving pluviam from caelum, and tempora fructifera, and implens corda vestra with alimenta and gaudeo.</p>
<p>And with these sayings scarce restrained they the populares, that they had not sacrificed unto them.</p>
<p>And there came thither certain Iudaei from Antiochia and Iconium, who persuaded the multitudinem, and having stoned Paulus, drew him out of the civitas, supposing he had been mortuus.</p>
<p>Howbeit, as the discipuli stood round about him, he arose up, and came into the civitas: and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.</p>
<p>And when they had preached the evangelium to that city, and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and Antiochia,</p>
<p>Confirming the animus of the discipuli, and exhorting them to remain in the fide, and that we must through multa tribulationes ingredi in the regnum Dei.</p>
<p>And when they had ordained sacerdotes for them in every ecclesia, and had orated and ieiunium with them, they commended them to the Dominius, in whom they believed.</p>
<p>And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.</p>
<p>And when they had preached the verbum in Perga, they went down into Attalia:</p>
<p>And thence sailed to Antiochia, from whence they had been recommended to the gratia of Deus for the opus which they fulfilled.</p>
<p>And when they were come, and had gathered the ecclesia together, they rehearsed all that Deus had done with them, and how he had opened the ostium fidei unto the gentibus.</p>
<p>And there they abode a long time with the discipuli.</p>
