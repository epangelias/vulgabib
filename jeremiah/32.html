                    <p>The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Pharaoh's  aegyptius, saying,</p>
<p>Thus speaketh the Lord God of Israel, saying, Write thee in a libellus this, for thus speaketh the Lord of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah.</p>
<p>Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I will give this urbs into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with ignis.</p>
<p>And thou shalt not escape out of his manus, but shalt surely be taken, and delivered into his manus, and thine oculi shall behold the oculi of the king of Babylon, and he shall loqui with thee mouth to mouth, and thou shalt go to Babylon.</p>
<p>Yet hear the word of the Lord, O Zedekiah rex of Judah; Thus saith the Lord of thee, Thou shalt not die by gladius in manus of the Chaldees,</p>
<p>But thou shalt die in pace, and with ignis of thy patres, the anterior rex which were before thee, so shall they burn ignis for thee; and they shall lamentare for thee, saying, Alas rex; for I have promissum the word, saith the Lord.</p>
<p>Then Jeremiah the prophet spake all these sermonem unto Zedekiah rex of Judah in Jerusalem,</p>
<p>When the king of Babylon's exercitus fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cives that were left in the urbs, and against the reliquus who were fled, and against those that had remansisse in the urbs.</p>
<p>And afterward, saith the Lord, I will give Zedekiah rex of Judah, and his servus, and the people, and such as are left in this urbs from the pestis, from the gladius, and from the famis, into the manus of Nebuchadrezzar rex of Babylon, and into the manus of their inimicus, and into the manus of those that seek their anima.</p>
<p>And thou shalt not escape out of their manus, but shalt surely be taken, and delivered into their manus, and thou shalt be given into the manus of the king of Babylon, and he shall interficere thee in the urbs which thou hast given him.</p>
<p>But the oculi of the house of Israel shall not be closed, that they should not see the terra which I have given them, saith the Lord.</p>
<p>Thus speaketh the Lord; This urbs shall surely be given into the manus of the king of Babylon's exercitus, which shall take it.</p>
<p>Therefore the princes said unto the king, We beseech thee, let this homo be put to death, for thus he weakeneth the manus of the homines of war that remain in this urbs, and the manus of all the people, in speaking such sermonem unto them; for this homo seeketh not the prosperitas of this people, but the malum.</p>
<p>Then Zedekiah rex said, Behold, he is in your manus; for the rex is not he that can do any thing against you.</p>
<p>Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the cisterna of Malchiah the filius of Hammelech, that was in the atrium of the prison; and they let down Jeremiah with funes.</p>
<p>And in the cisterna there was no aqua, but mire; so Jeremiah sunk in the mire.</p>
<p>Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchi which was in the domus of the king, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the cisterna; the king then sitting in the porta of Benjamin;</p>
<p>Ebedmelech went forth out of the domus of the king, and spake to the king, saying,</p>
<p>My lord O king, these homines have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the cisterna; and he is like to die for the famis in the place where he is; for there is no panis in the urbs.</p>
<p>Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from hence thirty viri with thee, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the cisterna, before he die.</p>
<p>So Ebedmelech took the viri with him, and they took up Jeremiah out of the cisterna with funes, and let him remain in the porta of the prison.</p>
<p>Then the king called Jeremiah, and said unto him, I will ask thee a quaestio, hide nothing from me.</p>
<p>Jeremiah said unto the king, If I declare it unto thee, wilt thou not surely put me to death? and if I give thee consilium, thou wilt not hearken unto me.</p>
<p>So the king sware a iuramentum unto Jeremiah, saying, As the Lord liveth that made us this anima, I will not put thee to death, neither will I give thee into the manus of these homines that seek thy anima.</p>
<p>Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel; If thou wilt assuredly go forth unto the principes of the king of Babylon's exercitus, then thy anima shall live, and this urbs shall not be burned with ignis; and thou shalt live, and thine domus;</p>
<p>But if thou wilt not go forth to the principes of the king of Babylon, then shall this urbs be given into the manus of the Chaldees, and they shall burn it with ignis, and thou shalt not escape out of their manus.</p>
<p>And Zedekiah rex said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Iudaei that are fallen to the Chaldees, lest they deliver me into their manus, and they mock at me.</p>
<p>But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver thee; obey, I beseech thee, the voice of the Lord, which I speak unto thee; so it shall be bene for thee, and thy anima shall live.</p>
<p>But if thou refuse to go forth, this is the word that the Lord hath shewed me;</p>
<p>And, behold, all the mulieres that are left in the domus of the king of Judah shall be brought forth to the principes of the king of Babylon's exercitus, and those mulieres shall say, When they have brought them unto the principes of the king of Babylon's exercitus, Thy frendi have deceived thee, and have prevailed against thee; thy pedes are sunk in the mire, and they are turned away back.</p>
<p>So they shall bring out all thy mulieres and thy filii to the Chaldees; and thou shalt not escape out of their manus, but shalt be taken by the manus of the king of Babylon.</p>
<p>And thou shalt cause this urbs to be burned with ignis, and the urbs shall be destroyed before your oculi;</p>
<p>Thus speaketh the Lord, This urbs shall surely be given into the manus of the king of Babylon's exercitus, which shall take it.</p>
<p>Therefore the princes said unto the king, We beseech thee, let this homo be put to death; for thus he weakeneth the manus of the homines of war that remain in this urbs, and the manus of all the people, in speaking such sermonem unto them; for this homo seeketh not the prosperitas of this people, but the malum.</p>
<p>Then Zedekiah rex said, Behold, he is in your manus; for the rex is not he that can do any thing against you.</p>
<p>Then they took Jeremiah, and cast him into the cisterna of Malchiah the filius of Hammelech, that was in the atrium of the prison; and they let down Jeremiah with funes into the cisterna; and there was no aqua in the cisterna, but mire; so Jeremiah sunk in the mire.</p>
<p>Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchi which was in the domus of the king, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the cisterna;</p>
<p>Ebedmelech went forth out of the domus of the king, and spake to the king, saying,</p>
<p>My lord O king, these homines have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the cisterna; and he is like to die for the famis in the place where he is; for there is no panis in the urbs.</p>
<p>Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from hence thirty viri with thee, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the cisterna, before he die.</p>
<p>So Ebedmelech took the viri with him, and they took up Jeremiah out of the cisterna with funes, and let him remain in the porta of the prison.</p>
<p>Then the king called Jeremiah, and said unto him, I will ask thee a quaestio, hide nothing from me.</p>
<p>Jeremiah said unto the king, If I declare it unto thee, wilt thou not surely put me to death? and if I give thee consilium, thou wilt not hearken unto me.</p>
<p>So the king sware a iuramentum unto Jeremiah, saying, As the Lord liveth that made us this anima, I will not put thee to death, neither will I give thee into the manus of these homines that seek thy anima.</p>
<p>Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel; If thou wilt assuredly go forth unto the principes of the king of Babylon's exercitus, then thy anima shall live, and this urbs shall not be burned with ignis; and thou shalt live, and thine domus;</p>
<p>But if thou wilt not go forth to the principes of the king of Babylon, then shall this urbs be given into the manus of the Chaldees, and they shall burn it with ignis, and thou shalt not escape out of their manus.</p>
<p>And Zedekiah rex said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Iudaei that are fallen to the Chaldees, lest they deliver me into their manus, and they mock at me.</p>
<p>But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver thee; obey, I beseech thee, the voice of the Lord, which I speak unto thee; so it shall be bene for thee, and thy anima shall live.</p>
<p>Then Zedekiah rex said unto Jeremiah, I have sinned against the Lord, I have transgressed against the voluntas of the Lord my God, and I have not hearkened unto the sermonem of the prophet Jeremiah, whom the Lord hath sent unto me, and I have not obeyed the voice of the Lord;</p>
<p>Therefore the Lord hath brought upon me all this malum, and behold, I am in the manus of the Chaldees, as thou seest this day.</p>
<p>Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will give this urbs into the manus of the king of Babylon's exercitus, and he shall take it;</p>
<p>And thou shalt not escape out of his manus, but shalt surely be taken, and delivered into his manus, and thine oculi shall behold the oculi of the king of Babylon, and he shall loqui with thee mouth to mouth, and thou shalt go to Babylon.</p>
<p>Yet hear the word of the Lord, O Zedekiah rex of Judah; Thus saith the Lord of thee, Thou shalt not die by gladius in manus of the Chaldees;</p>
<p>But thou shalt die in pace, and with ignis of thy patres, the anterior rex which were before thee, so shall they burn ignis for thee; and they shall lamentare for thee, saying, Alas rex; for I have promissum the word, saith the Lord.</p>
<p>Then Jeremiah the prophet spake all these sermonem unto Zedekiah rex of Judah in Jerusalem,</p>
<p>When the king of Babylon's exercitus fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cives that were left in the urbs, and against the reliquus who were fled, and against those that had remansisse in the urbs.</p>
<p>And afterward, saith the Lord, I will give Zedekiah rex of Judah, and his servus, and the people, and such as are left in this urbs from the pestis, from the gladius, and from the famis, into the manus of Nebuchadrezzar rex of Babylon, and into the manus of their inimicus, and into the manus of those that seek their anima.</p>
<p>And thou shalt not escape out of their manus, but shalt surely be taken, and delivered into their manus, and thou shalt be given into the manus of the king of Babylon, and he shall interficere thee in the urbs which thou hast given him.</p>
<p>But the oculi of the house of Israel shall not be closed, that they should not see the terra which I have given them, saith the Lord.</p>
