[
  "1 Hear me when I call, O Deus meus, and graciously hear me, and give ear unto me, when I call.",
  "2 O filii hominum, how long will ye turn my gloria into ignomia, how long will ye love vanitatem, and seek after mendacium?",
  "3 But know that Dominus hath set apart the sanctus for himselfe: the Dominus will hear when I call unto him.",
  "4 Stand in awe, and sinne not: commune with your own cor, upon your lectus, and be still. Selah.",
  "5 Offer the sacrificia of iustitiam, and put your trust in Dominus.",
  "6 There be many that say, Quis ostendit nobis bona? but thou, O Dominus, hast lifted up the lumen vultus tui upon us.",
  "7 Thou hast put gloria in my cor, more than in the tempus when their frumentum and vinum increased.",
  "8 I will both lay me downe in pace, and take my somnus: for thou, O Dominus, only makest me dwell in securitate."
