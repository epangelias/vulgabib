                    <p>Hear ye this, O priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and give ye ear, O house of the rex, for judgment is toward you, because ye have been a snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor.</p>
<p>And the revolters are profundus in slaughter, though I have been a castigator of them all.</p>
<p>I know Ephraim, and Israel is not absconditus from me: for now, O Ephraim, thou committest fornication, and Israel is polluted.</p>
<p>They will not frame their cogitationes to return to their Deus: for the spirit of fornication is in the midst of them, and they have not known the Dominus.</p>
<p>And the superbia of Israel doth testify to his faciem: therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquitas: Judah also shall fall with them.</p>
<p>They shall go with their greges and with their armenta to seek the Dominus; but they shall not find him; he hath withdrawn himself from them.</p>
<p>They have dealt treacherously against the Dominus: for they have begotten filios that are alienos; now shall a month devour them with their portiones.</p>
<p>Blow ye the bucina in Gibeah, the trumpet in Ramah: cry out at Bethaven, after thee, O Benjamin.</p>
<p>Ephraim shall be desolatus in the die of reprehension: among the tribus of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be.</p>
<p>The princes of Judah were like them that remove the metas; therefore I will pour out my indignatio upon them like water.</p>
<p>Ephraim is oppressed and broken in judicio, because he willingly walked after the vanitas.</p>
<p>Therefore will I be unto Ephraim as a musca, and the house of Judah as a musca that destroyeth.</p>
<p>When Ephraim saw his morbus, and Judah saw his vulnus, then went Ephraim to the Assyrii, and sent to rex Jareb: yet could he not heal you, nor cure you of your vulnus.</p>
<p>For I will be unto Ephraim as a leo, and as a young leo to the house of Judah: I, even I, will tear and go away; I will take away, and none shall rescue him.</p>
<p>I will go and return to my locus, till they acknowledge their iniquitas and seek my faciem: in their afflictio they will seek me early.</p>
