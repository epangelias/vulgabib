  "And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his casa in pace.",
  "And Jehu the filius of Hanani the prophet went out to meet him, and said to king Jehoshaphat, Shouldst thou help the impium, and love them that hate Dominum? therefore is the indignatio of Dominus upon thee.",
  "Nevertheless there are boni in thee, in that thou hast taken away the luci out of the land, and hast prepared thy cor to seek Deus.",
  "And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again through the populus from Beersheba to mount Ephraim, and brought them back unto Dominum Deus of their patres.",
  "Therefore he set judices in the land throughout all the fortified civitates of Judah, city by city,",
  "And said to the judices, Take heed what ye do: for ye judge not for hominem, but for Dominum, who is with you in the judicium.",
  "Wherefore now let the timor Domini be upon you; take heed and do it: for there is no iniquitas in Dominus our Deus, nor respect of personae, nor acceptance of dona.",
  "Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites, and of the sacerdotes, and of the chief patres of Israel, for the judicium of Dominus, and for controversies, when they returned to Jerusalem.",
  "And he charged them, saying, Thus shall ye do in the timore Domini, faithfully, and with a cor integrum.",
  "And what cause soever shall come to you of your fratres that dwell in their civitates, between sanguinem and sanguinem, between lex and mandatum, statutis, and judiciis, ye shall even warn them that they trespass not against Dominus, and so wrath come upon you, and upon your fratres: this do, and ye shall not trespass.",
  "And, behold, Amariah the filius of Jehoiada, the filius of the chief sacerdotes, shall be over you in all matters of Dominus; And Zebadiah filius of Ishmael, the dux of the domus of Judah, for all the king's matters: also the Levites shall be officiales before you. Deal courageously, and Dominus shall be with the bonus."
