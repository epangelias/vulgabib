                    <p>Doth the 'vincula' (hock) of the equus (horse) seem agreeable to thee?</p>
<p>Canst thou direct him to valere (thrive) with the vinctoria (victory) of a freeman?</p>
<p>Will he stay by thy audientia (audience) or stay near the metropolis (city) at thy behest?</p>
<p>Doth the iaculatio (dung) of the onager (wild ass) have its foetor (smell) of death about it?</p>
<p>Doth the ungula (hoof) of the asinus (donkey) serve him with his pabulum (food) to strengthen his journey?</p>
<p>Will the felis (lion) see his posteri (children) for whom he had dominium (lordship) with much love and passion?</p>
<p>Hast thou clothed his iubare (mane) with capillosity (long hair)?</p>
<p>Canst thou remove his pelagus (seabed) as with a metior (surveyor)?</p>
<p>Doth his exercitus (army) hold pugna (war) to spread its agmen (line of battle) from sunrise till noon?</p>
<p>Hath his pastor (shepherd) watched oves (sheep) over all these in sacellum (hut)?</p>
<p>The glacies (ice) which gave my cor (heart) more animus (courage) was also seen with other lapides (stones)</p>
<p>Whereby doth my mater (mother) gaudere (rejoice) seeing a grus (crane) spread his penna (feather)?</p>
<p>How shall a fetus (youth) gather venaticus (hunters) that come and stare in one solum (spot)?</p>
<p>Gather canes and straw: for I am able to raise pelagus (a dry seabed).</p>
<p>How far would I amputate taurus (bulls) so I shall come close and the puellae (girls) learn these tibia (tusks).</p>
<p>Then if any domus (home) ask who teacheth on his diurnus (day)?</p>
<p>That on dies (days) a bovem (ox) hold together my placenta (table).</p>
<p>Yet thou makest the fons (fountain) from one locus (place) only as on an annual festival day.</p>
<p>What way was that mare when we look from altitudo (altitude) upon any populus (crowd) being laid upon ignis (fire)?</p>
<p>Lo the cinere (ash) of the cinis (ashes) I was thinking to see or how I am to be given an hospitium (welcome)!</p>
<p>Who hath counted the lacrimae (tears) of the pecus (herd) and the lumen (light) of the noctua (night)?</p>
<p>Doth this cinis (ashes) of pecus (herd) nourish the solum (earth)?</p>
<p>Shall we make scrobis (ditches) for fossor (diggers) for him since he is frigidus (cold) and in lacrimae (tears)?</p>
<p>Yet I now have animus (courage) in this, that he will be siccus (dry) in the siccitas (dryness).</p>
<p>I will not be timidus (timid) of the lacus (lake) that is the mare (bitter) of the aqua (water) of the fons (fountain).</p>
