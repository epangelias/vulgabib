                    <p>Hold not thy peace, O Deus meus, for the os of the malus and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me:</p>
<p>They have spoken against me with lingua that is dolosus:</p>
<p>They compassed me about also with verba odiosi, and fought against me without causa.</p>
<p>For my amor they are adversarii mei: but I ora for them:</p>
<p>And they have rendered me malum pro bono, and odium pro dilectio:</p>
<p>Set thou malus over him: and let Satanas stand at his dexter manus.</p>
<p>When he shall be iudicatus, let him be condemnatus: and let his oratio become peccatum:</p>
<p>Let his dies be pauci: and let another take his episcopatus:</p>
<p>Let his filii be orphani, and his uxor vidua:</p>
<p>Let his filii be vagabundi, and beg for panem: and let them be ejected from their domus desolata:</p>
<p>Let the fenerator be vigilant over all that he hath: and let alieni despoil him of his labor:</p>
<p>Let there be none to extend unto him misericordia: neither let there be any to have pietas upon his orphani:</p>
<p>Let his nomen be deletus from the libellus of the vivi: and let him not be recorded with the iusti:</p>
<p>Let his dies be exigui: and in the same let his nomen be deletus:</p>
<p>He hath not regarded to concitare maledicta in me: and therefore let maledicta be in conspectu eius:</p>
<p>As he delighted in maledicere, so let it come unto him: and as he loved not benedictio, so let it be far from him:</p>
<p>As he was clothed with maledictio like a vestis: so let it come into his interiora like aqua: and like oleum in ossa eius:</p>
<p>Let it be unto him as the vestis which covereth him: and for the cinctura wherewith he is girt about:</p>
<p>Let this be the iudicium of them that iudicate me: and of them that speak malum against me:</p>
<p>But deal thou with me, O Deus Domine, according to thy nomen: because thy misericordia is bonus:</p>
<p>Quia I am pauper and indigens: and my cor is wounded within me:</p>
<p>I am gone like umbra simulacri: and I am shaken off as locusta:</p>
<p>My genua are debilia through ieiunium: and my caro is destituta of pinguedo:</p>
<p>I became also a opprobrium unto them: they looked upon me, and they shaked their capita:</p>
<p>Help me, O Deus Domine: and salvare me for thy misericordia:</p>
<p>Et sciunt quod hoc est manus tua: et quod tu, Domine, fecisti illud:</p>
<p>Maledicta illi qui maledixerunt mihi: sed qui benedicunt te, erunt salvati:</p>
<p>Qui iudicate vos in me, exsultabunt: et super me loquentur lingua: Omnes qui viderunt me, deriserunt me:</p>
