                    <p>Then said the high priest, Are these things so?</p>
<p>And he said, Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran,</p>
<p>And said unto him, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall shew thee.</p>
<p>Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in Haran: and from thence, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell.</p>
<p>And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on: yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child.</p>
<p>And God spake on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and entreat them evil four hundred years.</p>
<p>And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge, said God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place.</p>
<p>And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so Abraham begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat the twelve patriarchs.</p>
<p>And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God was with him,</p>
<p>And delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house.</p>
<p>Now there came a dearth over all the land of Egypt and Chanaan, and great affliction: and our fathers found no sustenance.</p>
<p>But when Jacob heard that there was corn in Egypt, he sent out our fathers first.</p>
<p>And at the second time Joseph was made known to his brethren; and Joseph's kindred was made known unto Pharaoh.</p>
<p>Then sent Joseph, and called his father Jacob to him, and all his kindred, threescore and fifteen souls.</p>
<p>So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he and our fathers,</p>
<p>And were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father of Sychem.</p>
<p>But when the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,</p>
<p>Till another king arose, which knew not Joseph.</p>
<p>The same dealt subtilly with our kindred, and evil entreated our fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to the end they might not live.</p>
<p>In which time Moses was born, and was exceeding fair, and nourished up in his father's house three months:</p>
<p>And when he was cast out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up, and nourished him for her own son.</p>
<p>And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds.</p>
<p>And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel.</p>
<p>And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him that was oppressed, and smote the Egyptian:</p>
<p>For he supposed his brethren would have understood how that God by his hand would deliver them: but they understood not.</p>
<p>And the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren; why do ye wrong one to another?</p>
<p>But he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us?</p>
<p>Wilt thou kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian yesterday?</p>
<p>Then fled Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of Madian, where he begat two sons.</p>
<p>And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sina an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush.</p>
<p>When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near to behold it, the voice of the Lord came unto him,</p>
<p>Saying, I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Then Moses trembled, and durst not behold.</p>
<p>Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet: for the place where thou standest is holy ground.</p>
<p>Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Then Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God.</p>
<p>And the Lord said unto him, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.</p>
<p>Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt:</p>
<p>And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.</p>
<p>And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, The Lord God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us go, we beseech thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the Lord our God.</p>
<p>And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand.</p>
<p>And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go.</p>
<p>And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall be, when ye go, ye shall not go empty:</p>
<p>But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.</p>
<p>And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The Lord hath not appeared unto thee.</p>
<p>And the Lord said unto him, What is that in thine hand? And he said, A rod.</p>
<p>And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.</p>
<p>And the Lord said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand:</p>
<p>That they may believe that the Lord God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee.</p>
<p>And the Lord said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous as snow.</p>
<p>And he said, Put thy hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and, behold, it was turned again as his other flesh.</p>
<p>And it shall be, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign.</p>
<p>And it shall be, if they will not believe also these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.</p>
<p>And Moses said unto the Lord, O my Lord, I am not eloquent, neither before, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant: but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.</p>
<p>And the Lord said unto him, Who hath made man's mouth? or who maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the Lord?</p>
<p>Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say.</p>
<p>And he said, O my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send.</p>
<p>And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well. And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart.</p>
<p>And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do.</p>
<p>And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be, even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of God.</p>
<p>And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do signs.</p>
<p>And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren which are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.</p>
<p>And the Lord said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt: for all the men are dead which sought thy life.</p>
<p>And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in his hand.</p>
<p>And the Lord said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into Egypt, see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have put in thine hand: but Pharaoh shall not hearken unto thee, that I may lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, and my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments.</p>
<p>And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the Lord, Israel is my son, even my firstborn:</p>
<p>And I say unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son, even thy firstborn.</p>
<p>And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the Lord met him, and sought to kill him.</p>
<p>Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband art thou to me.</p>
<p>So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband thou art, because of the circumcision.</p>
<p>And the Lord said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him.</p>
<p>And Moses told Aaron all the words of the Lord who had sent him, and all the signs which he had commanded him.</p>
<p>And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel:</p>
<p>And Aaron spake all the words which the Lord had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people.</p>
<p>And the people believed: and when they heard that the Lord had visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.</p>
