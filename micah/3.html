                    <p>And I said, Hear, I pray you, O principes, of Iudah, and ye that inhabit Ierusalem, give heed unto the vox of the Lord.</p>
<p>For the Lord hath spoken, I will arise, and will ascend unto the montes, and will go unto the fortitudo of Israel.</p>
<p>And the Lord said, Because the peccata of the domus of Israel, and of the domus of Iudah, are magnified, and they will not asserere me.</p>
<p>Therefore will I make Samaria as an ager, and her fructus as a vine in the desert.</p>
<p>And I will ponere the reliquiae of the domus of Israel, as one gathereth the reliquiae of the vindemia.</p>
<p>Therefore they shall not vide the terram of the Lord, and the Lord shall addere the peccata of the domus of Israel, and of the domus of Iudah, and shall consummare the peccata of the domus of Israel, and of the domus of Iudah, for they have provocare me to ira.</p>
<p>Thus saith the Lord, Against the triumvirate of the prophetae, that principes are in Samaria, and against the domus of Israel, that componunt in Ierusalem.</p>
<p>Her prophets are luxurians, and stubble, and the vox of the Lord is not in them; thus they shall confundere, and confundetur.</p>
<p>Thus saith the Lord, Propterea your peccata shall not be delere, nor your iniquitates abstergetur, for your iniquitates are before me, saith the Lord.</p>
