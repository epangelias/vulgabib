  "And they did work wiliness with their neighbours, saying, 'We are not far from you, for in our terra, in the which the Domini your Deus has given you, we shall be servus.'",
  "And the homines of Israel did not interrogate the Domini, but they did simulare the Gibeonites,",
  "And they went to Joshua, and unto the princes, saying, 'From a terra far away we are veni, now therefore facite a foedus with us.'",
  "And the homines of Israel said unto the Hivite, and unto the Canaanite, and unto the Gibeonite, 'Perhaps you dwell inter nos, and how shall we facere a foedus with you?'",
  "And they said unto Joshua, 'We are your servus.' And Joshua said unto them, 'Who are you, and from whence veni you?'",
  "And they said unto him, 'From a terra very far away your fama has been audi, and all that you have facere in the terra of the Amorites, which is beyond the Iordan, and in the terra of the rege of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and the Domini our Deus has tradere them before us, and we did occidere them, as the Domini our Deus has praecepit us.'",
  "And our senior did dimittere us, saying, 'Go and facite a foedus with the homines of Israel, for they are not far from you.'",
  "And now behold, we are in your manus, as it seems bonum in your oculi to do unto us, do.'",
  "And so Joshua did facere a foedus with them, to vivere among them, and to facere them servus, and the principes of the congregation did iurare unto them.",
  "And it came to passe, that when three dies were expirati, after they had facere a foedus with them, they heard that they were their proximi, and that they dwelt inter eos.",
  "And the filii of Israel did proficisci, and came unto their civitas on the tertius dies, and the civitas of the Gibeonites were Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim.",
  "And the filii of Israel did not percuss them, because the principes of the congregation had iurare unto them in the nomine of the Domini Deus of Israel: and all the congregation did murmur against the principes.",
  "And the principes did dicere unto the tota congregation, 'We have iurare unto them in the nomine of the Domini Deus of Israel, and now we may not tangere them.'",
  "Thus we will let them live, and they shall be lignarii and aquarii unto us: and the principes did dicere unto them, and unto the tota congregation.",
  "And Joshua did vocare them, and did dicere unto them, 'Why have you simulare us, saying, You are very far from us, when you dwell inter nos?'",
  "Now therefore you are maledicti, and there shall not be dimissus from you a servus, but you shall be lignarii and aquarii unto the domus of my Deus.'",
  "And they did respond unto Joshua, and did dicere, 'Because it has been nuntiatum unto your servus, that the Domini your Deus has praecepit Moses his servus to give unto you all the terra, and to occidere all the inhabitantes of the terra before you, therefore we did timere for our animae before you, and we did facere this thing.'",
  "And now behold, we are in your manus, as it seems bonum and rectum in your oculi to do unto us, do.'",
  "And so did Joshua unto them, and did save them from the manus of the filii of Israel, that they did not occidere them.",
  "And Joshua did facere them lignarii and aquarii unto the domus of the Domini, unto this dies, for the ligna of the altare of the Domini, and for the aqua of the congregation, and for the lavacrum of the pedes of the congregation, in the loco which the Domini has electus."
