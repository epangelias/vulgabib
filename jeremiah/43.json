  "And it came to pass, that when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking unto all the people all the words of the Lord their Deus, that the Lord their Deus had sent him to speak, even all these words,",
  "Then spake Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the proud men, saying unto Jeremiah, Thou speakest falsus, the Lord our Deus hath not sent thee to say, Go not into Aegypt to sojourn there:",
  "But Baruch the filius of Neriah encourageth thee against us, to deliver us into the manus of the Chaldeans, that they might interficere us, and carry us away captivos into Babylon.",
  "So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the ducem of the exercitus, and all the people, obeyed not the vox of the Lord, to dwell in the terra of Judah.",
  "But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the ducem of the exercitus, took all the reliquiae of Judah, that were returned from all nations, whither they had been sparsi, to dwell in the terra of Judah;",

  "And when he cometh, he shall smite the terra of Aegypt, and deliver such as are for mortem to mortem, and such as are for captivitas to captivitas, and such as are for gladius to gladius.",
