  "And the LORD sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and said unto him, There were two homines in one civitas, the one ricus and the other pauper.",
  "The ricus had exceeding many oves and boves, but the pauper had nothing, save one parvus capra which he had bought and nourished: and it grew up together with him, and with his filii: it did eat of his panis, and drank of his poculum, and lay in his sinu, and was unto him as a filia.",
  "And there came a viator to the ricus, and he spared to take of his own oves and boves, to dress a cena for the viator that was come unto him; but took the parvus capra of the pauper, and dressed it for the homo that was come to him.",
  "And David's animus was exceeding wroth against the hominem; and he said to Nathan, As the LORD vivit, the homo that hath done this thing shall surely mori.",
  "And Nathan said to David, Thou art the homo. Thus saith the LORD Deus of Israel, I anointed thee rex over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the manus of Saul;",
  "And I gave thee the domus of thy dominus, and the uxores of thy dominus into thy sinu, and gave thee the domus of Israel and of Iudah; and if that had been insufficient, I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things.",
  "Wherefore hast thou despised the verbum of the LORD, to do malum in my eyes? thou hast killed Uriah the Chettus, and hast taken his uxor to be thy uxor, and hast slain him with the gladius of the filii of Ammon.",
  "Now therefore the gladius shall never depart from thy domus; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the uxor of Uriah the Chettus to be thy uxor.",
  "Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up malum against thee out of thine own domus, and I will take thy uxores before thine oculi, and give them unto thy proximus, and he shall lie with thy uxores in the oculi of this sol.",
  "For thou didst it secreto: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sol.",
  "And David said unto Nathan, I have peccatum against the LORD. And Nathan said unto David, The LORD also hath put away thy peccatum; thou shalt not mori.",
  "Howbeit, because by this fact thou hast given great occasion to the inimici of the LORD to blaspheme, the filius also that is born unto thee shall surely mori.",
  "And Nathan departed unto his domus. And the LORD struck the puer that Uriah's uxor bare unto David, and it was languid.",
  "David therefore besought Deus for the puer; and David kept a ieiunium, and went in, and lay all nocte upon the terra.",
  "And the anciani of his domus arose, and went to him, to raise him up from the terra: but he would not, neither did he eat panis with them.",
  "And it came to pass on the septimus dies, that the puer died. And the servi of David feared to tell him that the puer was dead: for they said, Behold, while the puer was yet vivus, we spake unto him, and he would not hearken unto our vocem: how will he then vexare himself, if we tell him that the puer is dead?",
  "But when David saw that his servi whispered, David understood that the puer was dead: therefore David said unto his servi, Is the puer dead? And they said, He is dead.",
  "Then David arose from the terra, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his vestis, and came into the domus of the LORD, and adorated. Then he came to his own domus; and when he required, they set panis before him, and he comedit.",
  "Then said his servi unto him, What thing is this that thou hast done? thou didst ieiunium and afflict thy animus, while the puer was vivus; but now the puer is dead, thou dost rise up and comedit panis.",
  "And he said, While the puer was yet vivus, I ieiunium and afflicted my animus, and spake, Who knoweth whether GOD will be gracious to me, that the puer may vivere?",
  "But now he is dead, wherefore should I ieiunium? can I make him returne, that I should ieiunium for him? I shall go to him, but he shall not returne to me.",
  "And David comforted Bathsheba his uxor, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare him a filius, and he called his nomine Solomon: and the LORD loved him.",
  "And he sent by the manus of Nathan the propheta; and he called his nomine Jedidiah, because of the LORD."
