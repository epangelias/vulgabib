                    <p>And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a time of tribulatio, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the liber of life.</p>
<p>And many of them that sleep in the pulvis of the earth shall awake, some to vita aeterna, and some to ignis aeternum.</p>
<p>And they that be sapientes shall shine as the stellae of the firmament, and they that turn many to iustitia as the stellae for ever and ever.</p>
<p>But thou, O Daniel, shut up the sermones, and signa the liber, even to the tempus finis: many shall run to and fro, and scientia shall be increased.</p>
<p>Then I Daniel looked, and, behold, there stood other two, the one on this side of the flumen, and the other on that side of the flumen.</p>
<p>And one said to the man clothed in linen, which was upon the flumen, How long shall it be to the finis of these mirabilia?</p>
<p>And I heard the man clothed in linen, which was upon the flumen, when he held up his right manus and his left manus unto heaven, and sware by him that vivit in aeternum, That it shall be for a tempus, tempora, and a dimidium: and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the manus of the sanctus people, all these things shall be finis.</p>
<p>And I heard, but I understood not: then said I, O my Lord, what shall be the finis of these things?</p>
<p>And he said, Go thy way, Daniel: for the sermones are closed up and signati, till the tempus finis.</p>
<p>Many shall be purified, and made albi, and tried; but the impious shall do impie, and none of the impious shall understand; but the sapientes shall understand.</p>
<p>And from the tempus that the daily sacrificium shall be taken away, and the abominatio desolata set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety dies.</p>
<p>Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty dies.</p>
<p>But go thou thy way till the finis be: for thou shalt rest, and stand in thy lot at the finis of the dies.</p>
