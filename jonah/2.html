                    <p>Then Jonah prayed unto the LORD his Deus out of the fish's belly,</p>
<p>And said, I cried by reason of mine afflictio unto the LORD, and he heard me; out of the belly of gehenna cried I, and thou heardest my vox.</p>
<p>For thou hadst cast me into the profundum, in the midst of the mare, and the flumen compassed me about: all thy billows and thy waves passed over me.</p>
<p>Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again toward thy sanctuarium.</p>
<p>The aquae compassed me about, even to the anima: the profundum closed me round about, the alga was wrapped round my caput.</p>
<p>I went down to the fundamenta of the montes; the terra with her bars was about me for ever: yet hast thou brought up my vita from corruption, O LORD my Deus.</p>
<p>When my anima fainted within me I remembered the LORD: and my prayer came in unto thee, into thine aulam sanctuaria.</p>
<p>They that observe vanitates and lying vanitates, forsake their own misericordia.</p>
<p>But I will sacrifice unto thee with the vox of laudis; I will pay that that I have vowed. Salvation is of the LORD.</p>
<p>And the LORD spake unto the piscis, and it vomited out Jonah upon the terra.</p>
