                    <p>Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob.</p>
<p>Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp with the psaltery.</p>
<p>Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on our solemn feast day.</p>
<p>For this was a statute for Israel, and a law of the God of Jacob.</p>
<p>This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out through the land of Egypt: where I heard a language that I understood not.</p>
<p>I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were delivered from the pots.</p>
<p>Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder: I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. Selah.</p>
<p>Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if thou wilt hearken unto me;</p>
<p>There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship any foreign deus.</p>
<p>I am the LORD thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Aegyptus: open thy mouth wide, and I shall fill it.</p>
<p>But my people would not haudere to my vocem: and Israel would not obedire me.</p>
<p>So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lust: and they walked in their own consiliis.</p>
<p>O that my people had haudere to me, and Israel had walked in my viis!</p>
<p>I should soon have subdued their inimicos, and turned my manus against their adversaries.</p>
<p>The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto him: and that their tempus should have endured for ever.</p>
<p>He should have fed them also with the adipem of frumenti: and with miel out of the petra should I have satisfied thee.</p>
