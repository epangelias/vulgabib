                    <p>And the whole earth was of one lingua, and of one speech.</p>
<p>And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the orient, that they found a plain in the land of Sennaar, and they dwelt there.</p>
<p>And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar.</p>
<p>And they said, Go to, let us build us a civitas, and a turris, whose top may reach unto caelum; and let us make us a nomen, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole terra.</p>
<p>And the Lord came down to see the civitas and the turris, which the filii of men builded.</p>
<p>And the Lord said, Behold, the people is unum, and they have all one lingua; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.</p>
<p>Go to, let us descend, and there confound their lingua, that they may not understand one another's speech.</p>
<p>So the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the terra: and they left off to build the civitas.</p>
<p>Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the Lord did there confound the lingua of all the terra: and from thence did the Lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the terra.</p>
<p>These are the generations of Sem: Sem was the filius of an hundred years old when he begat Arphaxad two years after the diluvium:</p>
<p>And Sem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat filii and filiae.</p>
<p>And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah:</p>
<p>And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years, and begat filii and filiae.</p>
<p>And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:</p>
<p>And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat filii and filiae.</p>
<p>And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:</p>
<p>And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat filii and filiae.</p>
<p>And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:</p>
<p>And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat filii and filiae.</p>
<p>And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:</p>
<p>And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat filii and filiae.</p>
<p>And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:</p>
<p>And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat filii and filiae.</p>
<p>And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:</p>
<p>And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years, and begat filii and filiae.</p>
<p>And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.</p>
