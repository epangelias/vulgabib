                    <p>When the Lord thy Deus hath cut off the gentes, whose land the Lord Deus thy Deus giveth thee, and thou succeedest them, and dwellest in their civitates, and in their domus;</p>
<p>Thou shalt smite them utterly: thou shalt make no foedus with them, nor show them clementia:</p>
<p>Neither shalt thou make marriages cum eis: thy filia thou shalt not give unto his filius, nor his filia shalt thou take unto thy filius.</p>
<p>For they will turn away thy filius from following me, that they may serve other dii: so will the indignation of the Lord be kindled against you, and destroy thee suddenly.</p>
<p>But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall destroy their altaria, and break down their statuas, and cut down their lucus, and burn their imagines with ignis.</p>
<p>For thou art an holy gens unto the Lord Deus thy Deus: the Lord Deus hath chosen thee to be a special gens unto himself, above all gentes that are upon the terra.</p>
<p>The Lord Deus did not set his dilectio upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in numero than any gens; for ye were the fewest of all gentes:</p>
<p>But because the Lord Deus loved you, and because he would keep the iuramentum which he had sworn unto your patres, hath the Lord Deus brought you out with a manus potentia, and redeemed you out of the domus servitutis, from the manus of Pharaonis rex of Aegyptus.</p>
<p>Know therefore that the Lord Deus thy Deus, he is Deus, the fidelis Deus, which keepeth foedus and misericordia with them that love him and keep his mandata to a thousand generations;</p>
<p>And repayeth them that hate him to their facies, to destroy them: he will not be late to him that hateth him, he will repay him to his facies.</p>
<p>Thou shalt therefore keep the mandata, and the statuta, and the iudicia, which I command thee this day, to do them.</p>
<p>Wherefore it shall be, when the Lord Deus thy Deus hath given thee rest from all thy inimici round about, in the terra which the Lord Deus thy Deus giveth thee for hereditas to possess it, that thou shalt blot out the memoria of Amalech from under coelum: thou shalt not forget it.</p>
