                    <p>At that time, saith the Lord, they shall bring out the bones of the kings of Judah, and the bones of his principes, and the bones of the sacerdotes, and the bones of the prophetarum, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their sepulchres:</p>
<p>And they shall spread them before the sol, and the luna, and all the host of caelum, whom they have dilectus, and whom they have servitus, and after whom they have ambulatus, and whom they have quaesitus, and whom they have adoratus: they shall not be gathered, nor be buried; they shall be for sterquilinium upon the face of the terra.</p>
<p>Death shall be chosen rather than vita, by all the residue of them that remain of this malus populus, which remain in all the loci that I have reliquus, saith the Lord of hosts.</p>
<p>Moreover thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord; Shall they fall, and not rise? shall he turn away, and not return?</p>
<p>Why then is this populus of Jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual declinatio, and they hold fast deceit, they refuse to return?</p>
<p>I hearkened and heard, but they spake not aright: no man repented him of his malitia, saying, What have I done? every one turned to his proper cursus, as the equus rusheth into the proelium.</p>
<p>Yea, the sterna of the caelum know her station, and the turdi her tempus of coming; but my populus know not the judicia of the Lord.</p>
<p>How do ye say, We are sapientes, and the law of the Lord is with us? Lo, certainly in vain made he it; the calamus of the scriba is in vain.</p>
<p>The sapientes are confusus, they are dismayed and taken: lo, they have rejected the word of the Lord; and what sapientia is in them?</p>
<p>Therefore will I give their uxores unto others, and their agri to them that shall inherit them: for every one from the minimus even unto the maximus is given to cupiditas, from the propheta even unto the sacerdos every one dealeth falsely.</p>
<p>For they have healed the wound of the filia of my populus lightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no pax.</p>
<p>Were they confusus because they committed abomination? nay, they were not confusus with confusion, neither could they blush: therefore shall they fall among them that fall: in the tempus of their visitatio they shall be cast down, saith the Lord.</p>
<p>I will surely consume them, saith the Lord: there shall be no vires, and the vine shall give no flores, and the terra shall not give her fructus, and the olea shall not yield her oleum, and the greges shall not give their pecus: and I will destroy from them the vocem of joy, and the vocem of gaudium, the sponsum and the sponsa shall be taken away.</p>
<p>And it shall come to pass, when they shall say, Why doth the Lord our Deus do all these things unto us? then shalt thou say unto them, As ye have reliquus the Lord, and served alienos deos in your terra, so shall ye serve strangers in terra non vestra.</p>
<p>Declare this in the domus of Jacob, and publish it in Judah, saying,</p>
<p>Hear, O foolish populus, and without cor, which have eyes, and see not; which have aures, and hear not:</p>
<p>Fear ye not me? saith the Lord: will ye not tremble at my facies, who have placed the arena upon the terra, and the lapides of the littus by a perpetual decree, that they cannot transgredi?</p>
<p>Doth not the familia of the mari know the limina of the mari, that they come at the tempus appointed, and the terra trembleth at their veniunt, and all the inhabitants of the terra fall before him?</p>
<p>For the montes truly are montes of God: but the populus of the Lord is a part of the lignum of his hereditas: Israel is the vineyard of the Lord of hosts, and the domus of Israel the lignum of his fructus: and these my populus loved strangers.</p>
<p>I have seen folly in the prophetarum of Samaria; they prophesied in Baal, and caused my populus Israel to err.</p>
<p>In the prophetarum of Jerusalem also I have seen a terrible thing: they commit adulterium, and walk in mendacia, and they strengthen the manus of evildoers, that none doth return from his malitia: they are all of them unto me as Sodoma, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorra.</p>
<p>Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts concerning the prophetarum; Behold, I will feed them with fel, and make them drink venenum: for from the prophetarum of Jerusalem is profanitas gone forth into all the terra.</p>
<p>Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Hearken not unto the words of the prophetarum that prophesy unto you: they make you vain: they speak a vision of their own cor, and not out of the os of the Lord.</p>
<p>They say still unto them that despise me, The Lord hath said, Ye shall have pax; and they say unto every one that walketh after the imagination of his own cor, No malum shall come upon you.</p>
<p>For who hath stood in the consilium of the Lord, and hath perceived, and heard my verbum? who hath marked it, and heard it?</p>
<p>Behold, a tempest of the Lord goeth forth in indignatio, a tempest that shall not be caliginosus, shall lie upon the caput of the impiorum.</p>
<p>The indignatio of the Lord shall not return, until he have executed, and until he have performed the cogitata of his cor: in the novissimo of the dies ye shall consider it perfectly.</p>
<p>I have sent also unto you all my servos the prophetarum, rising up early, and sending them, saying, Return ye now every man from his malus via, and amend your studia, and go not after other deos to serve them, and ye shall dwell in the terra which I have given unto you and to your patres: but ye have not inclined your aures, nor hearkened unto me.</p>
<p>Because ye have not hearkened unto me, behold, I will send and take all the familiae of the aquilon, saith the Lord, and Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon, my servus, and will bring them against this terra, and against the inhabitants thereof, and against all these gentes round about, and will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and an hissing, and perpetual desolation.</p>
<p>Moreover I will take from them the vocem of gaudium and the vocem of laetitia, the sponsum and the sponsa, the vocem of the mole, and the lumen of the lucerna.</p>
<p>And this whole terra shall be a desolatio, and an astonishment; and these gentes shall serve the king of Babylon seventy annos.</p>
