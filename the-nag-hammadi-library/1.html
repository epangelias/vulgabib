                    <p>The Prayer of the Apostle Paul: The Father of my Lord Jesus Christ, qui est Deus et Dominus, hath blessed me with every spiritual benediction in the heavenly places in Christo.</p>
<p>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, qui hath blessed us with every spiritual benediction in the heavenly places in Christo.</p>
<p>According as he hath chosen us in illo before the foundation of the world, ut essemus sancti, and without blame before him in love.</p>
<p>Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christo, secundum beneplacitum voluntatis suae.</p>
<p>Unto the praise of the glory of his gratia, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.</p>
