  "Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her regalia, and stood in the atrium of the regia, over against the porta of the regia.",
  "And it was so, when the king saw Esther the regina, that she obtained favorem in his sight, and he held out to her the golden sceptrum that was in his manus.",
  "And Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptrum.",

  "Then said Esther, If it seem good unto the king, let the king and Haman come this day unto the convivium that I have prepared for him.",
  "And the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as Esther hath spoken: so the king and Haman came to the convivium that Esther had prepared.",
  "And the king said unto Esther at the convivium of vinum, What is thy petitio, Esther the regina? it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? it shall be performed, even to the medietas of the regnum.",

  "If I have found favorem in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petitio, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the convivium that I shall prepare for them, and I will do to morrow as the king hath said.",
  "Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a cor glad, but when Haman saw Mordecai in the porta of the regia, that he stood not up, nor moved for him, he was repletus with indignatio against Mordecai."
