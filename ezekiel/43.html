                    <p>Afterward he brought me to the porta of the templum, even the porta that looketh toward the orient: and, behold, the gloria of the Deus of Israel came from the way of the orient: and his vox was like a vox of many aquae, and the terra shone for his gloria.</p>
<p>And it was according to the apparere of the vision which I saw, even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the civitas: and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the flumen Chebar; and I fell upon my facies.</p>
<p>And the gloria of the Deus of Israel came from the way of the orient: and his vox was like a vox of many aquae, and the terra shone for his gloria.</p>
<p>And it was the apparere of the similitudo of the throne, as the apparere of the lapidem sapphirus; and upon the similitudo of the throne was the similitudo of a figura of a homo from the renes upward.</p>
<p>And I saw as the color of electrum, as the apparere of ignis round about within it, from the renes upward, and from the renes downward I saw as it were the apparere of ignis, and there was splendor round about.</p>
<p>This was the vision of the apparere of the gloria of the Deus of Israel by the flumen Chebar; and I fell upon my facies.</p>
<p>And he spake unto me out of the porta of the templum, saying, Fili hominis, thus saith the Dominus Deus; This porta shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and no homo shall enter in by it; because the Deus of Israel hath entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut.</p>
<p>It is for the prince; the prince, he shall sit in it to eat panem before the Dominus; he shall enter by the via of the vestibulum of the porta, and shall go out by the way of the same.</p>
<p>Then brought he me by the via of the porta of the templum that looketh toward the orient: and behold, the porta was shut.</p>
<p>Then said the Dominus unto me; This porta shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and no homo shall enter in by it: because the Deus of Israel hath entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut.</p>
<p>It is for the prince. The prince, he shall sit in it to eat panem before the Dominus; he shall enter by the via of the vestibulum of the porta, and shall go out by the way of the same.</p>
<p>Afterward he brought me to the porta of the templum, even the porta that looketh toward the orient: and, behold, the gloria of the Deus of Israel came from the way of the orient: and his vox was like a vox of many aquae, and the terra shone for his gloria.</p>
<p>And behold, the man, clothed with lineo, who had the stylus of the scriba by his renes, and he went in, and stood beside the columba of the porta.</p>
<p>And the Dominus said unto me, Fili hominis, behold with thine oculi, and hear with thine aures, and set thy cor upon every thing that I shall shew thee; for thou art brought hither that I might shew them unto thee: declare thou all that thou seest to the domus of Israel.</p>
<p>And behold, the vallum that was without the domus round about, and the length of the mensura of the vallum, five hundred cubitos: and the latitudo five hundred cubitos, to make a separation between the sanctuarium and the locus prophane.</p>
<p>And he measured the porta of the templum that looketh toward the orient: and he measured the porta, five cubitos the one valla, and five cubitos the other valla: and the spatium between the vallae, five cubitos the one, and five cubitos the other.</p>
<p>And the vallae, three on this side, and three on that side. And the spatium of the porta of the templum that looketh toward the orient, was the spatium of the porta of the templum that looketh toward the septentrio.</p>
<p>And he measured the porta of the templum that looketh toward the meridies: and he measured the porta, according to these mensurae.</p>
<p>And the porta toward the orient, and the porta toward the septentrio, and the porta toward the meridies, and the porta toward the occidens were all according to these mensurae.</p>
<p>And he said unto me, Fili hominis, thus saith the Dominus Deus; This porta of the templum that looketh toward the orient shall be shut, the six dies of the hebdomas it shall be shut, but on the diem sabbati it shall be opened, and on the diem of the novilunium it shall be opened.</p>
<p>The prince shall enter by the via of the vestibulum of the porta without, and shall stand by the columba of the porta, and the sacerdotes shall prepare his holocaustum, and his pacifici: and he shall worship at the columba of the porta, and shall go out: but the porta shall not be shut until the vesper, because of the multitude of the populus that shall worship at the domus of the Deus of Israel.</p>
<p>And he brought me to the atrium interior, and behold, there were thirty cameræ round about the atrium.</p>
<p>And the thirty cameræ were upon the spatium of twenty cubitos, and the spatium was centum cubitos: and the porta of the templum was toward the orient; and he measured the porta, according to these mensurae.</p>
<p>And he brought me to the porta of the templum that looketh toward the septentrio: and behold, the gloria of the Deus of Israel came from the way of the septentrio: and his vox was like a vox of many aquae, and the terra shone for his gloria.</p>
<p>And behold, the man clothed with lineo, who had the stylus of the scriba by his renes, and he went in, and stood beside the columba of the porta.</p>
<p>And the Dominus said unto me, Fili hominis, behold with thine oculi, and hear with thine aures, and set thy cor upon every thing that I shall shew thee; for thou art brought hither that I might shew them unto thee: declare thou all that thou seest to the domus of Israel.</p>
