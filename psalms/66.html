                    <p>To the chief Musician, A Song or Psalm. Make a joyful noise unto Deus, all ye lands:</p>
<p>Serve Dominus with fear, and rejoice with trembling.</p>
<p>Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the via of justitia, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.</p>
<p>O Deus, hear my vox, and hearken unto my prayer:</p>
<p>In thee have I put my trust, let me not be confusus for ever: deliver me in thy justitia.</p>
<p>Incline thine aurem unto me, and save me. Be thou my strong Rock, whereunto I may continually resort: thou hast given commandment to save me; for thou art my petra and my fortitudo.</p>
<p>In thee, O Deus, have I put my trust: let me not be ashamed, neither let mine enemies triumph over me.</p>
<p>Yea, none that wait on thee shall be confusus: let them be ashamed which transgress without a causa.</p>
<p>Shew me thy vias, O Deus; teach me thy semitae.</p>
<p>Lead me forth in thy veritas, and learn me: for thou art the Deus of my salvation; on thee do I wait all the day.</p>
<p>Remember, O Deus, thy misericordia and thy pietas; for they have been from aeternum.</p>
<p>Remember not the peccata of my juvenile, nor my rebelliones: according to thy pietas remember thou me for thy bonitas sake, O Deus.</p>
<p>Good and upright is Dominus: therefore will he teach sinners in the via.</p>
<p>The humble he will guide in iudicio: and the humble will he teach his via.</p>
<p>All the semitae of Dominus are misericordia and veritas to such as keep his foedus and testimonium.</p>
<p>For thy nominis sake, O Deus, pardon mine iniquitas; for it is magnus.</p>
<p>Who is the homo that feareth Dominus? him shall he teach in the via that he shall choose.</p>
<p>His animus shall dwell in bonum, and his seed shall inherit the terram.</p>
<p>The secretum of Dominus is with them that fear him; and he will shew them his pactum.</p>
<p>Mine oculi are ever toward Dominus; for he shall pluck my pedes out of the laqueus.</p>
<p>Turn thee unto me, and have pietas on me; for I am solus and pauper.</p>
<p>The troubles of my cor are enlarged: O bring thou me out of my afflictiones.</p>
<p>Look upon mine afflictio and my labour, and forgive all my peccata.</p>
<p>Look upon mine enemies; for they are multipliati: and they bear a violentus odium towards me.</p>
<p>Keep my animus and deliver me; let me not be ashamed, for I put my trust in thee.</p>
<p>Let integrity and justitia keep me; for I wait on thee.</p>
