                    <p>Behold, what manner of amor our Pater hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the filii of Deus: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew Him not.</p>
<p>Beloved, now are we the filii of Deus, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is.</p>
<p>Et quicumque habet spem hanc in eo, purificat se, sicut et ille purus est.</p>
<p>And every man that hath this spes in Him, purifieth himself, even as He is purus.</p>
<p>Whosoever committeth peccatum transgresseth also the lex: for peccatum is the transgression of the lex.</p>
<p>And ye know that He was manifested to take away peccata: and in Him is no peccatum.</p>
<p>Whosoever abideth in Him, sinneth not: whosoever sinneth, hath not seen Him, neither known Him.</p>
<p>Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doth iustitia is iust, even as He is iust.</p>
<p>He that committeth peccatum is of the Diabolus; for the Diabolus sinneth from the principio. For this purpose the Filius Dei was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the Diabolus.</p>
<p>Whosoever is born of Deus, doth not commit peccatum; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of Deus.</p>
<p>In hoc cognoscimus, quia cognovimus eum, et hic est amor, quia cognovimus eum et mandata eius servimus.</p>
<p>In this the charity of Deus was manifested toward us, because Deus sent His only begotten Filius into the world, that we might live through Him.</p>
<p>In hoc est amor, non quod nos dileximus Deus, sed quod ipse dilexit nos, et misit Filius suum propitiationem pro peccatis nostris.</p>
<p>Beloved, if Deus so loved us, we ought also to love one another.</p>
<p>No man hath seen Deus at any time. If we love one another, Deus abideth in us, and His amor is perfected in us.</p>
<p>Herein is our amor made perfect, that we may have fiducia in the die iudicii: because as He is, so are we in this mundus.</p>
<p>There is no timor in amor; but perfectum amor casteth out timor: because timor hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in amor.</p>
<p>We love Him, because He first loved us.</p>
<p>If some man say, I love Deus, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love Deus whom he hath not seen?</p>
<p>And this commandment have we from Him, That he who loveth Deus love his brother also.</p>
