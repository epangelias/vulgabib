                    <p>And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his somnus,</p>
<p>And said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold a candelabrum all of aurum, with a lampas on the top of it, and his septem lucernae thereon, and septem infundibula to the septem lucernae, which were upon the top thereof:</p>
<p>And two olivae by it, one upon the dexter manus of the lampas, and the other upon the sinister manus of it.</p>
<p>So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying, What are these, my dominus? And the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my dominus.</p>
<p>Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the verbum of the Domini to Zorobabel, saying, Not by exercitus, nor by potentia, but by my Spirit, saith the Domini of the exercitus.</p>
<p>Who art thou, O great monticulus? before Zorobabel thou shalt become a planus: and he shall bring forth the caput lapidis with shoutings, crying, Gratia, gratia upon it.</p>
<p>Moreover the verbum of the Domini came unto me, saying,</p>
<p>The manus of Zorobabel have laid the fundamentum of this domus, and his manus shall finish it; and thou shalt know that the Domini of the exercitus hath sent me unto you.</p>
<p>For who hath despised the dies parvos? and they shall rejoice, and shall see the lapidem of tinum in the manus of Zorobabel with the septem oculi of the Domini, they are the oculi of the Domini, which run to and fro through the tota terra.</p>
<p>Then answered I, and said unto him, What are these duo olivae upon the dexter manus of the lampas and upon the sinister manus of it?</p>
<p>And I answered again, and said unto him, What be these duo olivae branches which through the duo aurei tubi empty the aurum out of themselves?</p>
<p>And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my dominus.</p>
<p>Then said he, These are the duo filii olei, that stand by the Dominus of the tota terra.</p>
