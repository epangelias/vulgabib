  "Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be temptatus by the diabolus.",
  "And when he had fasted forty dies and forty noctes, he was afterward hungarius.",
  "And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou art the Filius Dei, command that these lapides be made panis.",
  "But he answered and said, It is scriptum, Man shall not live by panis alone, but by omni verbum that proceedeth out of the os Dei.",
  "Then the diabolus taketh him up into the holy civitas, and setteth him on a pinnaculum of the templum.",
  "And saith unto him, If thou art the Filius Dei, cast thyself down: for it is scriptum, He shall give his angelis charge concerning thee: and in their manus they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a lapide.",
  "Jesus said unto him, It is scriptum again, Thou shalt not temptare the Dominus Deus tuus.",
  "Again, the diabolus taketh him up into an exceeding high montem, and showeth him omnes regna mundi, and the gloria of them;",
  "And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and adoreare me.",
  "Then saith Jesus unto him, Begone, Satana: for it is scriptum, Thou shalt adoreare the Dominus Deus tuus, and him only shalt thou servire.",
  "Then the diabolus leaveth him, and, behold, angelis came and ministrated unto him.",
  "Now when Jesus had heard that John was delivered up, he departed into Galileam;"
