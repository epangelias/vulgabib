                    <p>And when Athaliah the mater of Ahaziah saw that her filius was mortuus, she arose and destroyed all the semina of the domus of Jehu, that she might reign.</p>
<p>But Jehosheba, the soror of Ahaziah, took Joash the filius of Ahaziah and stole him from among the filii of the rex, who were slain, and put him and his nutrix in the cubiculum.</p>
<p>So he was with her in the domus of the Deus, hiding himself, six annos, during which Athaliah reigned over the terra.</p>
<p>And in the septimus annus Jehoiada sent and took the centuriones and the duces of the Cimeliarchi, and brought them to him in the domus of the Deus, and made a foedus with them, and took an oath of them in the domus of the Deus, and shewed them the filius of the rex.</p>
<p>And he commanded them, saying, This is the res which ye shall do; A tertius pars of you that enter in on the Sabbatum, shall be keepers of the watch of the domus of the rex;</p>
<p>And a tertius pars in the porta of Sur, and a tertius pars in the porta behind the Cimeliarchi; so shall ye keep the watch of the domus, and be a fence about the rex.</p>
<p>And the duo partes of you, all that go forth on the Sabbatum, even they shall keep the watch of the domus of the Deus about the rex.</p>
<p>And ye shall compass the rex round about, every man with his arma in his manus; and he that cometh within the rerum, let him be mortuus; and be ye with the rex as he goeth out and as he cometh in.</p>
<p>And the centuriones did according to all things that Jehoiada the pontifex commanded; and they took every man his viros, those that were to come in on the Sabbatum, with those that were to go out on the Sabbatum, and came to Jehoiada the pontifex.</p>
<p>And the pontifex gave to the centuriones the hastae and the scuta which were rex David's, which were in the domus of the Deus.</p>
<p>And the Cimeliarchi stood, every man with his arma in his manus, round about the rex, from the right corner of the templum to the left corner of the templum, along by the altare and the templum.</p>
<p>Then they brought out the filius of the rex, and put upon him the diadema, and gave him the testimonium, and made him rex; and Jehoiada and his filii anointed him, and said, Vivat rex.</p>
<p>Now when Athaliah heard the vox of the populus, running and praising the rex, she came to the populus in the domus of the Deus;</p>
<p>And she looked, and behold, the rex stood by his columna, as the manner was, and the principes and the Buccina with the rex; and all the populus of the terra rejoiced, and blew with Buccinae; and Athaliah rent her vestes, and cried, Proditio, Proditio.</p>
<p>And Jehoiada the pontifex commanded the centuriones that were set over the exercitus, saying, Have her forth without the rerum, and let her be mortua by the manu of the viros; for the pontifex had said, Let her not be mortua in the domus of the Deus.</p>
<p>So they laid hands on her; and she went by the via of the equorum entrance to the domus of the rex, and there was she mortua.</p>
<p>And Jehoiada made a foedus between the Deus and the rex and the populus, that they should be the populus of the Deus; between the rex also and the populus.</p>
<p>And all the populus of the terra went into the domus of Baal, and brake it down; his altaria and his simulacra brake they in pieces thoroughly, and slew Mattan the sacerdos of Baal before the altaria; and the pontifex appointed officia over the domus of the Deus.</p>
<p>And he took the centuriones, and the Cimeliarchi, and the officia of the terra, and they brought down the rex from the domus of the Deus, and came by the via of the porta of the Cimeliarchi to the domus of the rex, and he sat on the thronus of the rex.</p>
<p>And all the populus of the terra rejoiced; and the civitas was in pace, after that they had mortuum Athaliah with the gladius.</p>
