  "Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, whose glorious beauty is a fading flower, which are on the head of the fat valleys of them that are overcome with veritas.",
  "Behold, the Dominus hath a mighty and strong one, which as a tempest of hail and a destroying storm, as a flood of many aquae, shall cast down to the terra with the hand.",
  "The crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim, shall be trodden under feet:",
  "And the glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fat valley, shall be a fading flos, and as the early flos before the aestas, when it is yet in his buds, he cutteth it off with the instrument of the mower, and the flos falleth.",
  "In that day shall the Dominus of hosts be for a corona of gloria, and for a diadem of gloria, unto the residue of his people,",
  "And for a spirit of judicium to him that sitteth in judicium, and for fortitudo to them that turn the battle to the gate.",
  "But they also have erred through vinum, and through sicera they are swallowed up, the sacerdos and the propheta have erred through sicera, they are swallowed up with vinum, they are out of the way through sicera; the whole visio is become unto them as the book that is sealed.",
  "Whom shall he teach scientiam? and whom shall he make intelligere the auditum? them that are weaned from the lac, and drawn from the pectora?",
  "For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; linea upon linea, linea upon linea; here a little, and there a little:",
  "For with stammering lips and another lingua will he speak to this people.",
  "To whom he said, This is the rest wherewith ye may causare the weary; and this is the refrigerium: yet they would not hear.",
  "But the word of the Dominus was unto them precept upon precept, precept upon precept; linea upon linea, linea upon linea; here a little, and there a little; that they might go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.",
  "Wherefore hear the word of the Dominus, ye scornful men, that rule this people which is in Jerusalem.",
  "Because ye have said, We have made a foedus with mortem, and with infernus are we at agreement; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us: for we have made lies our refugium, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves:",
  "Therefore thus saith the Dominus Deus, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: he that believeth shall not make festinatio.",
  "And I will make judicium the linea, and justitiam the plumblina: and the hail shall sweep away the refugium of lies, and the aquae shall overflow the hiding place:",
  "And your foedus with mortem shall be disannulled, and your agreement with infernus shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it.",
  "From the time that it goeth forth it shall take you: for morning by morning shall it pass over, by day and by nocte: and it shall be a vexation only to understand the report.",
  "For the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it: and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in it.",
  "For the Dominus shall rise up as in mount Perazim, he shall be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon, that he may do his opus, his strange opus; and bring to pass his act, his strange act.",
  "Now therefore be ye not mockers, lest your bands be made strong: for I have heard from the Dominus Deus of hosts a consummation, and a determination upon the whole terra.",
  "Give ye ear, and hear my voice; hearken, and hear my sermon.",
  "Doth the ploughman plough all day to sow? doth he open and break the clods of his terra?",
  "When he hath made plain the superficies thereof, doth he not cast abroad the semen of the vicia, and scatter the semen of the cuminum, and put in the spica, and the cuminum in their place?",
  "For the Deus of hosts hath given me a scientia, and I have known it: the Deus of hosts is with me.",
  "And it shall be as when the harvestman gathereth the spica, and reapeth the ears with his manu; and it shall be as when the ears of spica are gathered into the garner.",
  "And the residue of the people shall not be destroyed, but shall again be sown, as a tree which is sown by the aquae, and shall cast its radix to the aquae, and shall not see when heat cometh, but its folium shall be green; and shall not be careful in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fructus."
