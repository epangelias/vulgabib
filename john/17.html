                    <p>These words spake Iesus, and lifted up his eyes to caelum, and said, Pater, the hour is come; glorify thy Filius, that thy Filius also may glorify thee:</p>
<p>As thou hast given him potestatem over all carnem, that he should give aeterna vita to as many as thou hast given him.</p>
<p>And this is aeterna vita, that they might know thee the only verus Deus, and Iesus Christ whom thou hast sent.</p>
<p>I have glorified thee on terra: I have finished the opus which thou gavest me to do.</p>
<p>And now, O Pater, glorify thou me with thine own self with the gloria which I had with thee before the mundus was.</p>
<p>I have manifested thy nomen unto the homines which thou gavest me out of the mundus: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have kept thy verbum.</p>
<p>Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee.</p>
<p>For I have given unto them the verba which thou gavest me; and they have received them, and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me.</p>
<p>I pray for them: I pray not for the mundus, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine.</p>
<p>And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them.</p>
<p>And now I am no more in the mundus, but these are in the mundus, and I come to thee. Holy Pater, keep through thy nomen those whom thou hast given me, that they may be unum, as we are.</p>
<p>While I was with them in the mundus, I kept them in thy nomen: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the Filius perdition, that the Scriptura might be fulfilled.</p>
<p>And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the mundus, that they might have my gaudium fulfilled in themselves.</p>
<p>I have given them thy verbum; and the mundus hath hated them, because they are not of the mundus, even as I am not of the mundus.</p>
<p>I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the mundus, but that thou shouldest keep them from malum.</p>
<p>They are not of the mundus, even as I am not of the mundus.</p>
<p>Sanctify them through thy veritas: thy verbum is veritas.</p>
<p>As thou hast sent me into the mundus, even so have I also sent them into the mundus.</p>
<p>And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the veritas.</p>
<p>Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their verbum;</p>
<p>That they all may be unum; as thou, Pater, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be unum in us: that the mundus may believe that thou hast sent me.</p>
<p>And the gloria which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be unum, even as we are unum:</p>
<p>I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in unum; and that the mundus may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.</p>
<p>Pater, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my gloria, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the fundamentum of the mundus.</p>
<p>O iustus Pater, the mundus hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me.</p>
<p>And I have declared unto them thy nomen, and will declare it: that the amor wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.</p>
