                    <p>1 The transgression of the wicked saith within my cor, There is no timor Dei before his oculi.</p>
<p>2 For he flattereth himself in his own oculi, till his iniquitas be found to be hateful.</p>
<p>3 The words of his os are iniquitas and dolus: he hath left off to be sapient and to do bonum.</p>
<p>4 He deviseth iniquitas upon his lectus: he setteth himself in via that is not bona: he abhorreth not malum.</p>
<p>5 Thy misericordia, O Domine, is in caelis; thy veritas reacheth unto the nubes.</p>
<p>6 Thy iustitia is like the montes of God: thy iudicia are a great profundum.</p>
<p>7 How precious is thy misericordia, O Deus: therefore the filii of men put their trust under the umbra of thy alas.</p>
<p>8 They shall be abundantly satisfied with the pinguedo of thy domus: and thou shalt make them drink of the rivus of thy voluptas.</p>
<p>9 For with thee is the fons of vita: in lumine tuo we see lumen.</p>
<p>10 O continue thy misericordia unto those that know thee; and thy iustitia unto those that are recti corde.</p>
<p>11 Let not the pes of superbus come against me, and let not the manus of impie seize me.</p>
<p>12 There are the operarii of iniquitas fallen: they are cast down, and shall not be able to surgere.</p>
<p>36 The malum of the wicked shall destroy them: because they refused to do iustitia.</p>
<p>37 Mark the perfecte, and behold the iustus: for the finis of that vir is pacem.</p>
<p>38 But the transgressores shall be destroyed together: the posterior of the wicked shall be cut off.</p>
<p>39 But the salvus of the iusti is a Domino: he is their fortitudo in tempore tribulationis.</p>
<p>40 Et Dominus adiuvabit eos, et salvabit eos: et eripiet eos a malis, quia in eo speraverunt.</p>
