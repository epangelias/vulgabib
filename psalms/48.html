                    <p>Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praesidium in the city of our Deus.</p>
<p>Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole terra, is mount Sion, on the sides of the septentriones, the city of the great Rex.</p>
<p>God is known in her palatiums for a refugium.</p>
<p>For, lo, the reges of the earth are gathered together, with the naves of the Tharsis, as if they would conquer it.</p>
<p>They saw it, and so they admirabantur; they were consternati, and hasted away.</p>
<p>Fear took hold upon them there, and pain, as of a woman in partu.</p>
<p>Thou breakest the naves of Tharsis with an east wind.</p>
<p>As we have audied, so have we videre in the city of the Lord of exercituum, in the city of our Deus: Deus will establish it for ever. Selah.</p>
<p>We have pensatum, O Deus, thy misericordia in the midst of thy templum.</p>
<p>According to thy nominis, O Deus, so is thy laus unto the fines of the terra: thy dextera is full of justitia.</p>
<p>Let mount Sion be glad, let the filiae of Judah be joyful, because of thy judicia.</p>
<p>Walk about Sion, and go round about her: tell the towers thereof.</p>
<p>Mark ye well her munition, and consider her palatiums: that ye may tell it to the generation sequens.</p>
<p>For this Deus is our Deus for ever and ever: he will be our ductor even unto death.</p>
