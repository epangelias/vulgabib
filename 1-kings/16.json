  "Then the word of the Lord came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha, saying, 'Arise, and anoint Jehu the son of Nimshi to be rex over Israel in his loco, that he may strike the domus of Baasha, and destroy it, and I will make the domus of Jehu like the domus of Jeroboam the filius of Nebat.'",
  "For I will look upon the malum of Baasha, and upon the malum of the domus of his pater, who have sinned against me to provoke me to ira with their vanitates, and behold, I will consume Baasha, and the domus of his pater, and I will make the domus of Baasha like the domus of Jeroboam the filius of Nebat.'",
  "Him that dieth of Baasha in the civitas shall the canes eat, and him that dieth of his in the ager shall the aves caeli eat.'",
  "Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his fortitudo, are they not written in the libro annalium of the reges of Israel?",
  "So Baasha slept with his patres, and was sepultus in Tirzah, and Elah his filius reigned in his loco.",
  "And also by the manu of the propheta Jehu the filius of Hanani came the word of the Lord against Baasha, and against his domus, even for all the malum that he did in the sight of the Lord, to provoke him to ira with the opera of his manus, in being like the domus of Jeroboam, and because he killed him.",
  "In the vigesimo sexto anno of Asa rex of Judah began Elah the filius of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, two annos.",
  "And his servus Zimri, dux of half his currus, conspired against him, as he was in Tirzah, drinking and ebrius in the domus of Arza, who was over the domus in Tirzah.",
  "And Zimri went in and struck him, and killed him, in the vigesimo septimo anno of Asa rex of Judah, and reigned in his loco.",
  "And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his thronus, that he killed all the domus of Baasha, he left him not one masculus, neither of his cognati, nor of his amici.",
  "Thus did Zimri destroy all the domus of Baasha, according to the word of the Lord, which he spake against Baasha by Jehu the propheta.",
  "For all the peccata of Baasha, and the peccata of Elah his filius, by which they sinned, and by which they made Israel peccare, to provoke the Lord Deum of Israel to ira with their vanitates.",
  "Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his conspiratio which he conspired, are they not written in the libro annalium of the reges of Israel?",
  "In the vigesimo septimo anno of Asa rex of Judah did Zimri reign seven dies in Tirzah, and the castrum was at war.",
  "And it came to pass, when the castrum saw that Zimri had killed the rex, and that all Israel had conspired against him, that all Israel made Omri, dux of the exercitus, rex over Israel that day in the castrum.",
  "And Omri went up from Gilgal, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah.",
  "And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the civitas was taken, that he went into the arx of the domus of the rex, and burned the domus of the rex over him with ignis, and died.",
  "For his peccata which he sinned in doing malum in the sight of the Lord, in walking in the via of Jeroboam, and in his peccatum which he did, to make Israel peccare.",
  "Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his conspiratio which he conspired, are they not written in the libro annalium of the reges of Israel?",
  "Then were the filii of Israel divided into two partes, half of the populus followed Tibni the filius of Ginath, to make him rex, and half followed Omri.",
  "But the populus that followed Omri prevailed against the populus that followed Tibni the filius of Ginath, so Tibni died, and Omri reigned.",
  "In the triginta primo anno of Asa rex of Judah began Omri to reign over Israel, twelve annos, six annos reigned he in Tirzah.",
  "And he bought the mons Samaria of Shemer for two talents of argentum, and built on the mons, and called the nomine of the civitas which he built, Samaria, after the nomine of Shemer, owner of the mons Samaria.",
  "And Omri did malum in the sight of the Lord, and wrought wickedly above all that were before him.",
  "For he walked in all the via of Jeroboam the filius of Nebat, and in his peccata by which he made Israel peccare, to provoke the Lord Deum of Israel to ira with their vanitates.",
  "Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his fortitudo that he shewed, are they not written in the libro annalium of the reges of Israel?",
  "So Omri slept with his patres, and was sepultus in Samaria, and Ahab his filius reigned in his loco.",
  "And in the triginta octavo anno of Asa rex of Judah began Ahab the filius of Omri to reign over Israel, and Ahab the filius of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty two annos.",
  "And Ahab the filius of Omri did malum in the sight of the Lord above all that were before him.",
  "And it came to pass, as if it had been a parum thing for him to walk in the peccata of Jeroboam the filius of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel the filia of Ethbaal rex of the Sidonii, and went and served Baal, and worshipped him.",
  "And he reared up an altare for Baal in the domus of Baal, which he had built in Samaria.",
  "And Ahab made a palma, and Ahab did more to provoke the Lord Deum of Israel to ira than all the reges of Israel that were before him."
