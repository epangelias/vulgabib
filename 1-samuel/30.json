  "And it came to pass, when David and his homines were come to Ziklag on the tertius day, that the Amalekites had invasus Ziklag, and burnt it with ignis,",
  "And had taken the mulieres captivas, that were therein: they slew not any, either parvulus or femina, but carried them away, and went on their via.",
  "So David and his homines came to the civitas, and, behold, it was burnt with ignis; and their mulieres, and their filii, and their filiae were taken captivi.",
  "Then David and the populus that was with him lift up their voces and wept, until they had no more lacrimae to weep.",
  "And David's duas uxores were taken captivi, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the uxor Nabal the Carmelitess.",
  "And David was in angustia: for the populus spake of lapidating him, because the animus of all the populus was bitter, each man for his filii and his filiae: but David encouraged himself in the Domini his Deus.",
  "And David said to Abiathar the sacerdos, O Abiathar, I pray thee, bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David.",
  "And David inquired at the Domini, saying, Shall I pursue after this gregem? shall I overtake them? And he answered him, Persequere: for thou shalt surely overtake them, and recover whatever.",
  "So David went, he and the sexcenti homines that were with him, and came to the torrentem Besor, where those that were left behind stayed.",
  "But David pursued, he and quattuorcenti homines: for duo centena homines were left behind, which were so fatigati that they could not transire the torrentem Besor.",
  "And they found an Aegyptius in campo, and brought him to David, and gave him panis, and he did eat; and they made him drink aqua;",
  "And they gave him a partem of a torta of figs, and duo massae of passum: and when he had eaten, his spirit returned to him: for he had eaten no panis, nor drunk aqua, for tres dies and tres noctes.",
  "And David said unto him, To whom belongest thou? and whence art thou? And he said, I am a juvenile homo of Aegyptus, servant to an Amalekite; and my dominus left me, because tres dies agone I fell sick.",
  "We made an incursio upon the Negev of the Cherethites, and upon that which belongeth to Judah, and upon the Negev of Caleb; and we burnt Ziklag with ignis.",
  "And David said to him, Canst thou bring me down to this gregem? And he said, Swear unto me by Deus, that thou wilt not occidere me, nor deliver me into the manus of my dominus, and I will bring thee down to this gregem.",
  "And he swore unto him, and brought him down to the homines: and, behold, they were spread abroad upon all the terra, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the magna praeda which they had taken out of the terra of the Philistim, and out of the terra of Judah.",
  "And David smote them from the crepusculo even unto the vespera of the sequens die: and there escaped not a homo of them, save quattuorcenti juvenile homines, which fled on camelis, and escaped.",
  "And David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken away: and David rescued his duas uxores.",
  "And there was nothing lacking to them, neither parvulus nor femina, neither filius nor filia, neither spolia, nor any thing that they had taken to them: David recovered all.",
  "And David took all the greges and the armenta of the Amalekites: and David took also those oves and boves, and camelos, and asinos, and pecus, and returned to the torrentem Besor.",
  "And they came to the duo centena homines, which were so fatigati that they could not follow David, whom they had made to stay at the torrentem Besor: and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the populus that was with him: and when David came near to the populus, he saluted them in pacem.",
  "But all the malignant and malicious homines of the populus answered and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give them any of the praeda that we have recovered: except to every homo his uxor and his filii, that they may take them, and go.",
  "Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my fratres, with that which the Domini hath given us, who hath preserved us, and delivered the gregem that came against us into our manus.",
  "For who will hearken unto you in this sermo? for as the pars of him that goeth down to the praelium, so shall be the pars of him that tarrieth by the sarcinae: they shall parte alike.",
  "And it was so from that die forward, that he made it a statutum and a jus in Israel unto this die.",
  "And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the praeda unto the seniores of Judah, even to his amici, saying, Behold a donum for you of the praeda of the inimici of the Domini;",
  "To them which were in Bethel, and to them which were in the Ramathaim, and to them which were in Jattir,",
  "And to them which were in Aroer, and to them which were in Siphmoth, and to them which were in Eshtemoa,",
  "And to them which were in Rachal, and to them which were in the civitates of the Jerahmeelites, and to them which were in the civitates of the Kenites,",
  "And to them which were in Hormah, and to them which were in Chorashan, and to them which were in Athach,",
  "And to them which were in Hebron, and to all the loca where David himself and his homines were wont to haunt."
