  "Likewise, ye wives, be in submissio to your husbands; that, if any obey not the verbum of God, they also may without the verbum be won by the conversation of the wives;",
  "While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear.",
  "Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of jewels of gold, or of putting on of apparel;",
  "But let it be the hidden homo of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of Deus very precious.",
  "For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in Deus, adorned themselves, being in submissio unto their own husbands:",
  "Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him dominus: whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any terror.",
  "Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to scientia, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the gratia of life; that your prayers be not hindered.",
  "Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous:",
  "Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit benedictio.",
  "For he that will love vita, and see dies, let him eschew malum, and do bonum; let him seek pacem, and ensue it.",
  "For the eyes of the Dominus are over the just, and his aures are open unto their prayers: but the facies of the Dominus is against them that do malum."
