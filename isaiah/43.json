  "But now thus saith the Lord that created thee, O Jacob, and he that formed thee, O Israel, Fear not: for I have redemptus thee, I have called thee by thy nomine.",
  "When thou passest through the aqua, I will be with thee; and through the flumen, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the ignis, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flamma kindle upon thee.",
  "For I am the Lord thy Deus, the Holy One of Israel, thy Salvator: I gave Egypt for thy redemptus, Ethiopia and Seba for thee.",
  "Since thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast been honorabilis, and I have loved thee: therefore will I give homines for thee, and gentes for thy vita.",
  "Fear not: for I am with thee: I will bring thy semen from the orient, and gather thee from the occident;",
  "I will say to the aquilon, Give up; and to the austros, Keep not back: bring my filii from far, and my filiae from the ends of the terra.",
  " Omne who is called by nomine, whom I have created for gloria mea, whom I have formed, yea, whom I have made.",
  "Bring forth the caecus people that have oculi, and the surdi that have aures.",
  "Let all the gentes be gathered together, and let the people be assembled: who among them can declarare this, and shew us former things? let them bring forth their testes, that we may know them, that we may know, and understand, and say, Veritas is with you.",
  "Ye are my testes, saith the Lord, and my servus whom I have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am the same, and that there is no Deus besides me; and that there is none besides me.",
  "I am the Lord, and there is none else, there is no Deus besides me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me:",
  "That they may know from the rising of the sol, and from the occident, that there is none besides me. I am the Lord, and there is none else.",
  "I form the lucem, and create the tenebrae: I make the pacem, and create the malum: I the Lord do all these things.",
  "Descendo from the caelum, ye pluiae, and let the nubes rorate justitiam: aperi, terra, and bring forth salvus, and let justitia bud forth with him; I the Lord have created him.",
  "Woe to him that striveth with his factor, the potsherd with the potsherds of the terra! Shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it, What makest thou? or thy work, He hath no manus?",
  "Woe to him that saith to his pater, What begettest thou? or to the mater, What bringest thou forth?",
  "Thus saith the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, and his factor, Ask me of the gentes, and concerning the things to come, concerning my filii, and concerning the work of my manus, command ye me.",
  "I have made the terra, and created man upon it: I, even my manus, have stretched out the caelos, and all their host have I commanded.",
  "I have raised him up in justitia, and I will direct all his viae: he shall build my civitas, and he shall let my captivus go, not for pecunia, nor for munera, saith the Lord of hosts.",
  "Thus saith the Lord, The labor of Egypt, and the negotiatio of Ethiopia and of the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over unto thee, and they shall be thine: they shall come after thee; in catenis they shall come over, and they shall fall down unto thee, they shall make supplication unto thee, saying, Suretly Deus is in thee; and there is none else, there is no Deus.",
  "Verily thou art a Deus that hidest thyself, O Deus of Israel, the Salvator.",
  "They shall be ashamed, and also confounded, all of them: they shall go to confusion together that are makers of idolum.",
  " Israel hath been saved by the Lord with a perpetual salvus: ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded mundo aeterno.",
  "For thus saith the Lord that created the caelos; Deus himself that formed the terra, and made it; He hath established it, He created it not in vanum, He formed it to be inhabited: I am the Lord; and there is none else.",
  "I have not spoken in abscondito, in a place of the terra: I said not unto the semen Jacob, Seek ye me in vanum: I the Lord speak justitiam, I declare things that are rectus.",
  "Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, ye that are saved of the gentes: they have no scientia that set up the lignum of their idolum, and pray unto a deus that cannot salvus.",
  "Declare and bring them near; yea, let them take counsel together: who hath declared this from the antiquus? who hath told it from that time? have not I the Lord? and there is no Deus else besides me; a justus Deus and a Salvator; there is none besides me.",
  "Look unto me, and be saved, all the fines terrae: for I am Deus, and there is none else.",
  "I have sworn by myself, the verbum is gone out of my os in justitia, and shall not return, That unto me every genu shall bow, every lingua shall confess Deus.",
  "Suretly, shall one say, in the Lord have I justitia and potentia: even to him shall men come; and all that are incensed against him shall be ashamed.",
  "In the Lord shall all the semen Israel be justus and shall gloria."
