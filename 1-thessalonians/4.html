                    <p>Furthermore, brethren, we beseech and exhort you in the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us verbum (word) of the testimonium (testimony) of Christ, so ye would walk in it;</p>
<p>Therefore, brethren, we pray and beseech you in the Lord Jesus, that as ye have accepted of us the traditio (tradition) of Christ, so ye would walk in it;</p>
<p>For ye know what mandatum (commandments) we gave you by the Lord Jesus;</p>
<p>For this is the voluntas (will) of Deus (God), your sanctificatio (sanification), that ye should abstain from fornicatio (fornication);</p>
<p>That every unus (one) of you should know how to possess his vas (vessel) in sanctificatio (sanification) and honor;</p>
<p>Not in passionate desiderium (desire) as the gentes (gentiles) who know not Deus (God);</p>
<p>That no homo (man) go beyond or defraud his brother in negotium (business), because the Dominus (Lord) is the vindicator of all;</p>
<p>For Deus (God) hath not called us unto inmunditia (uncleanness), but unto sanctificatio (sanification);</p>
<p>He therefore that rejecteth, rejecteth not homo (man), but Deus (God), who hath also given unto us the Spiritum (Spirit) of gratia (grace);</p>
<p>But we pray always for you, that our Deus (God) would count you worthy of this vocatio (calling), and fulfill all the voluntas (will) of his bonitas (goodness), and the operatio (operation) of the fides (faith) with potentia (power);</p>
<p>That the nomine (name) of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the gratia (grace) of our Deus (God) and of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
