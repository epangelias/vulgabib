                    <p>And it came to pass on the eighth dies, Moses called Aaron and his filii, and the seniores of Israel;</p>
<p>And he said unto Aaron, Take thee a vitulus of the bovine genus for a peccatum, and a ram for a holocaustum, without defectus, and offer them coram Domino.</p>
<p>And unto the filii of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a caper of the goat genus for a peccatum; and a calf, and a lamb, both of the first anno, without defectus, for a holocaustum;</p>
<p>Also a ram, and a bullock, of the bovine genus, for pacification: and offer them coram Domino, with a gift of bread, made of farina of wheat, with oleum, and libations: for today the Dominus will appear unto you.</p>
<p>And they brought that which Moses commanded coram the tabernaculum of the congregation: and all the multitude was collected coram the Lord.</p>
<p>And Moses said, This is the verbum which the Lord commanded to be done. And Moses looked, and behold, they had done it as the Lord had commanded: thus had they done.</p>
<p>And Moses brought Aaron and his filii, and washed them cum aqua.</p>
<p>And he put upon him the tunicam, and girded him with the cincturam, and clothed him with the pallium, and put the ephod thereon, and girded him with the cincturam of the ephod, and bound it unto him therewith.</p>
<p>And he put the pectoral upon him: also he put in the pectoral the Urim and the Thummim;</p>
<p>And he put the mitram upon his caput: also upon the mitram, even upon his forefront, did he put the golden ornament, the coronam sanctitatis; as the Lord commanded Moses.</p>
<p>And Moses took the oleum of unction, and anointed the tabernaculum and all that was therein, and sanctified them.</p>
<p>And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar septies, and anointed the altar and all his vessels, both the laver and his foot, to sanctify them.</p>
<p>And he poured of the oleum of unction upon Aaron's caput, and anointed him, to sanctify him.</p>
<p>And Moses brought Aaron's filii, and put tunics on them, and girded them with cincturas, and put mitras upon them; as the Lord commanded Moses.</p>
<p>And he brought the vitulus of the bovine genus for the peccatum: and Aaron and his filii laid their manus upon the caput of the vitulus of the bovine genus for the peccatum;</p>
<p>And he slew it: and Moses took the sanguis, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured the sanguis at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified it, to make reconciliation upon it.</p>
<p>And he took all the adipem that was upon the intestines, and the lobe that is above the liver, and the two renes, and their adipem, and Moses burned it upon the altar.</p>
<p>But the vitulus of the bovine genus, and his pellis, and his carne, and his dung, he burnt with ignis without the castra, as the Lord commanded Moses.</p>
<p>And he brought the ram for the holocaustum: and Aaron and his filii laid their manus upon the caput of the ram;</p>
<p>And he slew it: and Moses sprinkled the sanguis upon the altar round about;</p>
<p>And he cut the ram into his pieces; and Moses burnt the caput, and the pieces, and the adipem;</p>
<p>And he washed the intestines and the pedes in aqua; and Moses burnt the whole ram upon the altar: it was a holocaustum for a sweet odorem, and an oblatio made by ignis unto the Lord; as the Lord commanded Moses.</p>
<p>And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecratio: and Aaron and his filii laid their manus upon the caput of the ram;</p>
<p>And he slew it: and Moses took of the sanguis of it, and put it upon the tip of Aaron's auris dextra, and upon the pollex of his manus dextra, and upon the pollex of his pes dextra;</p>
<p>And he brought Aaron's filii, and Moses put of the sanguis upon the tip of their aures dextra, and upon the pollices of their manus dextra, and upon the pollices of their pedes dextra: and Moses sprinkled the sanguis upon the altar round about;</p>
<p>And he took the adipem, and the rump, and all the adipem that was upon the intestines, and the lobe above the liver, and the two renes, and their adipem, and the right shoulder;</p>
<p>And out of the basket of azymes, that was coram the Lord, he took one azymum, and a cake of bread oiled with oleum, and one wafer, and put them on the adipem, and upon the right shoulder;</p>
<p>And he put all upon Aaron's manus, and upon the manos of his filii, and waved them for a wave oblatio coram the Lord;</p>
<p>And Moses took them from off their manos, and burnt them upon the altar upon the holocaustum: they were consecrations for a sweet odorem: it was an oblatio made by ignis unto the Lord.</p>
<p>And Moses took the pectoral, and filled it with ignis from off the altar, and put incensum thereon, and brought it within the velum, and put it upon the altar, and put incensum thereon, and made atonement for the filii of Israel.</p>
