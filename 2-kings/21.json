  "Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and five years in Ierusalem, and his mother's name was Hephzibah.",
  "And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, after the abominations of the heathen, whom the Lord cast out before the children of Israel.",
  "For he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down, and he reared up altars for Baal, and made a grove, as did Ahab king of Israel, and worshipped all the host of caelum, and served them.",
  "And he built altars in the house of the Lord, of which the Lord said, In Ierusalem shall my name be for ever.",
  "And he built altars for all the host of caelum in the two courts of the house of the Lord.",
  "And he caused his children to pass through the ignis, in the valley of the son of Hinnom: also he observed times, and used enchantments, and dealt with wizards and familiar spirits, and wrought much evil in the sight of the Lord, to provoke him to anger.",
  "And he set a graven image of the idol which he had made in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Ierusalem, which I have chosen before all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:",
  "Neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from out of the land which I have appointed for your fathers; so that they will take heed to do all that I have commanded them, according to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of Moses.",
  "So Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Ierusalem to err, and to do worse than the heathen, whom the Lord destroyed before the children of Israel.",
  "And the Lord spake to Manasseh, and to his people: but they would not hearken.",
  "Wherefore the Lord brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of Assyria, which took Manasseh among the thorns, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.",
  "And when he was in affliction, he besought the Lord his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers,",
  "And prayed unto him: and he was intreated of him, and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Ierusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the Lord he was God.",
  "Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his God, and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of the Lord God of Israel, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel.",
  "His prayer also, and how God was intreated of him, and all his sin, and his trespass, and the places wherein he built high places, and set up groves and graven images, before he was humbled: behold, they are written among the sayings of the seers.",
  "So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.",
  "Amon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Ierusalem.",
  "But he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, as his father Manasseh did.",
  "And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and worshipped them:",
  "And he forsook the Lord God of his fathers, and walked not in the way of the Lord.",
  "And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and slew the king in his own house.",
  "And the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead."
