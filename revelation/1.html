                    <p>The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his servus (servants) things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servus John:</p>
<p>Who bare record of the Word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw.</p>
<p>Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand.</p>
<p>John to the seven ecclesiae (churches) which are in Asia: Grace be unto you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne;</p>
<p>And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our peccata (sins) in his own blood,</p>
<p>And hath made us kings and sacerdotes (priests) unto God and his Father; to him be gloria and dominium for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p>Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every oculus (eye) shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all the kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.</p>
<p>I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.</p>
<p>I John, who also am your fratres (brother), and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isla (island) that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>I was in the Spirit on the Lord's Day, and heard behind me a great vox (voice), as of a trumpet,</p>
<p>Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What thou seest, write in a libellum (book), and send it unto the seven ecclesiae which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea.</p>
<p>I turned to see the vox that spake with me. And being turned, I saw seven candelabra of aurum (gold);</p>
<p>And in the midst of the seven candelabra one like unto the Filium Hominis (Son of Man), clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the pectora (breast) with a golden zona (girdle).</p>
<p>His caput (head) and his hairs were white like white wool, as white as snow; and his oculi (eyes) were as a flame of ignis (fire);</p>
<p>And his pedes (feet) like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a fornace (furnace); and his vox as the sound of many aquae (waters).</p>
<p>And he had in his dexter (right hand) seven stellae (stars): and out of his os (mouth) went a sharp two-edged gladius (sword): and his facies (face) was as the sol (sun) shineth in his virtus (power).</p>
<p>When I saw him, I fell at his pedes as dead. And he laid his dexter manus (hand) upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last:</p>
<p>I am he that liveth, and was mortuus (dead); and, behold, I am vivus (alive) for evermore, Amen; and have the claves (keys) of morte (death) and of infernum (hell).</p>
<p>Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be after this;</p>
<p>The mystery of the seven stellae which thou sawest in my dexter mano, and the seven candelabra of aurum. The seven stellae are the angels of the seven ecclesiae: and the seven candelabra which thou sawest are the seven ecclesiae.</p>
