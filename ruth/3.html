                    <p>1. Then Naomi her mother in law said unto her, My filia, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be bene with thee?</p>
<p>2. And now is not Boaz of our cognatio, with whose puellae thou wast? Behold, he winnoweth barley to night in the area.</p>
<p>3. Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy vestimenta upon thee, and go down to the area: but make not thyself known to the vir till he shall have consummated to eat and drink.</p>
<p>4. And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt nota the locus where he shall lie, and thou shalt veni and uncover his pedes, and lay thee down; and he shall te dicere what thou shalt do.</p>
<p>5. And she said unto her, All that thou sayest I will do.</p>
<p>6. And she went down unto the area, and did according to all that her mother in law bade her.</p>
<p>7. And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his cor was good, he went to lie down at the extremum of the horreum: and she came softiter, and uncovered his pedes, and laid her down.</p>
<p>8. And it came to pass at midnight, that the vir was terrified, and turned himself, and behold, a mulier lay at his pedes.</p>
<p>9. And he said, Quis es tu? And she answered, I am Ruth thy famula: spread therefore thy vestimenta over thy famula; for thou art a propinquus of mine.</p>
<p>10. And he said, Blessed art thou of the Domini, my filia: thou hast showed more beneficentia in the novissimo than at the principio, in that thou followedst not young viri, whether paucae or multae.</p>
<p>11. And now, my filia, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou requirest: for all the porta of my populus doth know that thou art a mulier of virtus.</p>
<p>12. And now it is vero, that I am thy propinquus: howbeit there is a propinquus nearer than I.</p>
<p>13. Tarry this nocte, and when the mane shall appear, if he will take thee, bene; let him take thee: but if he will not take thee, then will I take thee, as the Domini liveth: lie down until the mane.</p>
<p>14. And she lay at his pedes until the mane: and she rose up before one could nosse another. And he said, Let it not be notum that a mulier came into the horreum.</p>
<p>15. Also he said, Bring the vestimenta that thou hast upon thee, and hold it. And when she held it, he measured six modii of barley, and laid it on her: and she went into the civitas.</p>
<p>16. And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Quis es tu, my filia? And she told her all that the vir had done to her.</p>
<p>17. And she said, These six modii of barley gave he me; for he said to me, Go not empty unto thy mother in law.</p>
<p>18. Then said she, Sit still, my filia, until thou shalt know how the res shall fall: for the vir will not rest, until he shall have finire this res to die.</p>
