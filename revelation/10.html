                    <p>I saw still another mighty angel come down from caelum, clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow was upon his caput, and his facies was as the sol.</p>
<p>And he had in his manus a libellus open: and he set his pedes upon the mare, and on the terra, and cried with a vox magnus, saying, 'It is factus!'</p>
<p>And when he had cried, seven tonitrua uttered their voces.</p>

<p>And I took the libellus out of the angel's manus, and ate it up; and it was in my os sweet as mel: and as soon as I had eaten it, my venter was bitter.</p>
<p>And he said unto me, 'Thou must prophesy again before many peoples, and gentes, and linguae, and reges.'</p>
