  "Moreover the Lord said unto me, Take thee a great roll, and scribere with a man's stylus concerning Maher-shalal-hash-baz.",
  "And I took unto me faithful testes, Uriah the priest, and Zachariah the son of Jeberechiah.",
  "And I went unto the prophetess; and she concepit, and peperit a filium. Then said the Lord to me, Call his nomen Maher-shalal-hash-baz.",
  "For before the puer shall have scientia to cry, Abba, pater, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be taken away before the king of Assyria.",
  "The Lord spake also unto me again, saying,",
  "Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Siloah that flow softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's filius;",
  "Now therefore, behold, the Dominus bringeth up upon them the aquas of the river, strong and many, even the king of Assyria, and all his gloria: and he shall come up over all his flumina, and shall go over all his ripas:",
  "And he shall pass through Judah; he shall overflow and go over, he shall reach even to the cervix; and the stretching out of his alae shall fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel.",
  "Associate vos, ye people, and ye shall be confractus in pieces; and give ear, all ye of far countries: gird yourselves, and ye shall be confractus in pieces; gird yourselves, and ye shall be confractus in pieces.",
  "Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought; speak the word, and it shall not stand: for Deus is with us.",
  "For the Lord spake thus to me with a strong manus, and instructed me that I should not walk in the via of this people, saying,",
  "Say ye not, A confederatio to all them to whom this people shall say, A confederatio; neither fear ye their timorem, nor be afraid.",
  "Sanctify the Lord of hosts himself; and let him be your timor, and let him be your metus.",
  "And he shall be for a sanctuarium; but for a lapidem offendiculi, and for a petram scandali to both the domus of Israel, for a laqueus and for a fossa to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.",
  "And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.",
  "Bind up the testimonium, seal the legem among my discipuli.",
  "And I will wait upon the Lord, that hideth his facies from the domus of Jacob, and I will look for him.",
  "Behold, I and the children whom the Lord hath given me are for signa and for portenta in Israel from the Lord of hosts, which dwelleth in mount Sion.",
  "And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep, and that mutter: should not a people seek unto their Deus? for the living to the dead?",
  "To the legem and to the testimonium: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no lux in them.",
  "And they shall pass through it, hardly bestead and hungry: and it shall come to pass, that when they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves, and curse their rex and their Deus, and look upward.",
  "And they shall look unto the earth; and behold trouble and darkness, dimness of anguish; and they shall be driven to obscurity.",
  "Nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation, when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, and afterward did more grievously afflict her by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, in Galilee of the gentes."
