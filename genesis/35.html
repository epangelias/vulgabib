                    <p>And God said unto Jacob, 'Arise, perge (go) unto Bethel, et habita (and dwell) there: et fac (and make) there an altar Deo (to God), qui apparuit (who appeared) tibi (to you), cum fugeres (when you fled) a facie (from the face) fratris tui (of your brother) Esau.'</p>
<p>Then Jacob said unto his domus (household), and to all who were cum eo (with him), 'Auferite (put away) deos alienos (alien gods) quae sunt in medio vestri (which are among you), et purificamini (and purify yourselves), et mutate (and change) vestimenta (your garments).'</p>
<p>Arise, et ascendamus (and ascend) in Bethel, ut faciam (so that I may make) ibi altare Deo (there an altar to God), qui exaudivit me (who answered me) in die tribulationis meae (in the day of my tribulation), et fuit mecum (and was with me) in via (in the way) qua ambulavi (which I walked).'</p>
<p>Et dedit eis Jacob nomen (and Jacob gave them the name) Lus, eo quod dixerit (because he said), 'Deus me apparuit (God appeared to me) ibi, cum essem solus (when I was alone).'</p>
<p>Postquam autem reversus est (and after he returned) de Mesopotamia Syriae (from Mesopotamia of Syria), ascendit (he went up) in Bethel, ipse et omnis populus qui erat cum eo (he and all the people who were with him).</p>
<p>Aedificavitque (and he built) ibi altare, et vocavit nomen loci (and called the name of the place) Bethel, eo quod ibi apparuerat (because God appeared to him) ei Deus, cum fugeret (when he fled) a facie fratris sui (from the face of his brother).</p>
<p>Ibi mortua est (there died) Debora, nutrix (the nurse) Rebeccae, et sepulta est (and was buried) subter Bethel, subter quercum (under the oak) latam, et vocavit Jacob nomen loci (and Jacob called the name of the place) abscissio quercus (the oak of weeping).</p>
<p>Deus autem apparuit (and God appeared) rursus (again) Iacob, postquam reversus est (after he returned) de Mesopotamia Syriae (from Mesopotamia of Syria), et benedixit ei (and blessed him).</p>
<p>Dixitque ei (and he said to him), 'Nomen tuum Iacob (your name is Jacob), non iam vocaberis (you will not be called) Iacob, sed Israhel (but Israel) erit nomen tuum (will be your name).'</p>
<p>Vocavitque (and he called) nomen eius Israhel (his name Israel), et ait (and he said), 'Eris (you will be) pater multarum gentium (the father of many nations), et reges ex te erunt (and kings will be from you).'</p>
<p>Terra autem quam dedi (and the land which I gave) Abraham et Isaac (to Abraham and Isaac), dabo et tibi (I will give to you), et semini tuo post te (and to your seed after you) possidebis eam (you will possess it).'</p>
<p>Postquam autem benedixit (and after he blessed) ei, ascendit (he went up) a eo, et reversus est (and returned) in locum suum (to his place).</p>
<p>Elevaverunt autem (and they erected) filii Israel, monumentum (a monument) in loco illo (in that place), lapidem grande (a great stone).</p>
<p>Et obtulerunt super eum (and they offered on it) libamina (libations) et holocausta (and burnt offerings) Domino (to the Lord).</p>
<p>Dein abiit (and then he went) Iacob (Jacob) in Hebron, ubi habitaverat (where he had dwelled) pater eius (his father) et avus (and grandfather), et mansit ibi (and stayed there), quia ibi fuerant (because they had been) dies peregrinationis eius (the days of his pilgrimage).</p>
<p>Apparuit autem ei (and it was told to him) quod esset (that was) mortua (dead) Rachel, et sepulta in via (and buried in the way) itineris Ephratha (of Ephrath), id est Bethleem (that is, Bethlehem).</p>
<p>Et erat monumentum (and there was a monument) Rachel in via (in the way), itineris Ephratha (of Ephrath), id est Bethleem (that is, Bethlehem).</p>
<p>Israel autem transfretavit (and Israel journeyed) cum omnibus quae possidebat (with all that he had), et venit in Bersebim (and came to Beersheba), et obtulit victimas (and offered sacrifices) Deo (to God) patris sui (of his father) Isaac.</p>
<p>Apparuitque ei (and he appeared) Deus nocte (at night), et ait (and said), 'Iacob, Iacob (Jacob, Jacob), et dixit (and he said), 'Ecce adsum (behold, I am here).'</p>
<p>Dixitque ei (and he said to him), 'Ego sum Deus (I am God) patris tui (of your father), noli timere (do not fear) descendo in Aegyptum (descending into Egypt), quia ibi faciam te (because I will make you) in gentem magnam (into a great nation).'</p>
