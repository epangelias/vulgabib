                    <p>Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ, and called, vocati in the faith of the common salvation:</p>
<p>Mercy unto you, and peace, and amor, be multiplied, multiplicetur in you, through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord, Dominus;</p>
<p>Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the communione of our common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the fide, which was once delivered unto the sancti,</p>
<p>3 For there are certain men crept in unawares, qui subintroierunt, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, unrighteous men, turning the gratia of our God into lascivia, and denying the only Dominus Deus, and our Lord Jesus Christ,</p>
<p>5 I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, that the Lord, having saved the people out of the terra of Aegypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not,</p>
<p>6 And the angels which kept not their principality, but left their own habitatio, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the grande die,</p>
<p>7 Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornicatio, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal ignis,</p>
<p>8 Likewise also these filthy dreamers, somniarii, defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignitas,</p>
<p>9 Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the diabolus he disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee,</p>
<p>10 But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves,</p>
<p>11 Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Core,</p>
<p>12 These are spots in your agapes, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of the winds; late autumn trees, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;</p>
<p>13 Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own confusion; wandering stellae, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever,</p>
<p>14 And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with thousands of his sancti,</p>
<p>15 To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him,</p>
<p>16 These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speaketh great swelling words, having men's persons in admiration because of advantage,</p>
<p>17 But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostoli of our Lord Jesus Christ;</p>
<p>18 How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly desires,</p>
<p>19 These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit,</p>
<p>20 But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy fide, praying in the Holy Ghost,</p>
<p>21 Keep yourselves in the amor of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal vita,</p>
<p>22 And of some have compassion, making a difference:</p>
<p>23 And others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating even the tunic spotted by the carnem,</p>
<p>24 Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his gloria with exceeding joy,</p>
<p>25 To the only wise Deus our Saviour, be gloria and majestas, dominio and potestas, now and ever, and for evermore. Amen.</p>
