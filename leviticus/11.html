                    <p>And the Lord spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them, 'Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consummare them this day.'</p>
<p>This is the animalia which ye shall eat; the bovem, the ovis, and the capra.</p>
<p>Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, and cheweth the cud, among the animalia, that shall ye eat.</p>
<p>Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the hoof: the camelus, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you.</p>
<p>And the lepus, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you.</p>
<p>And the porcus, because he divideth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, but cheweth not the cud; he is unclean unto you.</p>
<p>Of their caro shall ye not eat, and their cadaver ye shall not touch; they are unclean to you.</p>
<p>These shall ye eat of all that are in the aqua: whatsoever hath pinnae and squama in the aqua, in the mari, and in the fluvius, them shall ye eat.</p>
<p>And all that have not pinnae and squama in the mari, and in the fluvius, of whatsoever moveth in the aqua, and of any living thing which is in the aqua, they shall be an abomination unto you:</p>
<p>They shall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their caro, but ye shall have their cadaver in abomination.</p>
<p>Whatsoever hath no pinnae nor squama in the aqua, that shall be an abomination unto you.</p>
<p>And these ye shall have in abomination among the volucres; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: the aquila, and the vultur, and the milvus,</p>
<p>The corvus, and the struthio, and the noctua,</p>
<p>The bubo, and the ibis, and the porphyrion,</p>
<p>The charadrius, and the cicada, and the upupa,</p>
<p>The gallus, and the nycticorax, and the mergus,</p>
<p>The stercorarius, and the chlamydotheres, and the pelicanus,</p>
<p>The struthiocamelus, and the onocrotalus, and the larus,</p>
<p>The corvus, and the milvus, and the psittacus,</p>
<p>The porphyrion, and the vultur, and the mergus,</p>
<p>The ibis, and the nycticorax, and the caprimulgus,</p>
<p>The stercorarius, and the chlamydotheres, and the struthiocamelus.</p>
<p>All fliers that have four pedes, shall be an abomination unto you.</p>
<p>Yet these ye may eat of them that flieth; the locusta, and the attacus, and the ophiomachus, and the acridius, and the bruchus, and the attelebus,</p>
<p>And every flier that hath four pedes, which have longus crus; to these ye may eat.</p>
<p>But all other fliers, which have four pedes, shall be an abomination unto you.</p>
<p>And for these ye shall be unclean: whosoever toucheth their cadaver, shall be unclean until the vesper.</p>
<p>And whosoever beareth ought of their cadaver, shall wash his vestes, and be unclean until the vesper.</p>
<p>The caro of them which divideth the hoof, and is not clovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, is unclean unto you: every one that toucheth them shall be unclean.</p>
<p>And whatsoever goeth upon the ventrus, and whatsoever goeth upon all four, which have many pedes, or whatsoever hath no pedes, and moveth upon the ventrus, them ye shall not eat; for they are unclean unto you.</p>
<p>Ye shall not make your animae abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them, that ye should be defiled thereby.</p>
<p>For I am the Dominus your Deus: be ye therefore sancti, for I am sanctus: neither shall ye make your animae abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth upon the terra.</p>
<p>For I am the Dominus who bringeth you up out of the terra Aegypti, to be your Deus: ye shall therefore be sancti, for I am sanctus.</p>
