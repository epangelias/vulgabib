                    <p>Unto thee will I cry, O Deus meus, Rock; why art thou silent to me?</p>
<p>Hear, O Deus, my voice, when I cry unto thee; have mercy on me and hear me.</p>
<p>I will give thanks unto thy nomen, for it is bonum.</p>
<p>For thou hast been a strong tower for me against the inimicus.</p>
<p>I will trust in thee, O Deus meus; how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph?</p>
<p>How long shall they utter and speak hard things and all the workers of iniquitas boast themselves?</p>
<p>They break in pieces thy populus, O Deus, and afflict thine hereditas.</p>
<p>They slay the vidua and the peregrinus, and murder the orphan.</p>
<p>Yet they say, The Dominus shall not see, neither shall the Deus of Iacob regard it.</p>
<p>Understand, ye stupid among the populus; and ye fools, when will ye be wise?</p>
<p>He that planted the aurem, shall he not hear? he that formed the oculum, shall he not see?</p>
<p>He that chastiseth the gentes, shall he not correct? he that teacheth hominem knowledge, shall he not know?</p>
<p>The Deus knoweth the cogitationes of hominum, that they are vanitas.</p>
<p>Blessed is the homo that the Deus correcteth; therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Omnipotens Deus.</p>
<p>For he maketh dolor, and bindeth up; he woundeth, and his manus cureth.</p>
<p>He shall deliver thee in six tribulationes; yea, in seven there shall no malum touch thee.</p>
<p>In famis he shall redeem thee from mortis, and in bello from the potestas of the gladius.</p>
<p>Thou shalt be hid from the flagellum of the lingua; neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.</p>
<p>At destruction and famis thou shalt laugh; neither shalt thou be afraid of the bestias of the terra.</p>
<p>For the Deus shall charge his angelis for thee, to keep thee in all thy viis.</p>
<p>They shall bear thee up in their manus, lest thou dash thy pedem against a stone.</p>
<p>Thou shalt walk upon the aspidem and basiliscum; the lion and the young leo shalt thou tread under thy pedes.</p>
<p>Quoniam he hath set his dilectio on me, therefore will I deliver him; I will set him on high, because he hath known my nomen.</p>
<p>He shall cry unto me, and I will hear him; I will be with him in tribulatio, I will deliver him and honour him.</p>
<p>With longa vita will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.</p>
