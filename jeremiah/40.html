                    <p>The word that came to Jeremiah from the Dominus, after that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all that were carried away captive of Jerusalem and Judah, which were carried away captive unto Babylon.</p>
<p>And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said unto him, The Dominus thy Deus hath pronounced this evil upon this place.</p>
<p>Now the Dominus hath brought it, and done according as he hath said: because ye have sinned against the Dominus, and have not obeyed his voice, therefore this thing is come upon you.</p>
<p>And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the chains which were upon thine hand. If it seem good unto thee to come with me into Babylon, come; and I will look well unto thee: but if it seem ill unto thee to come with me into Babylon, forbear: behold, all the land is before thee; whither it seemeth good and convenient for thee to go, thither go.</p>
<p>Now while he was not yet gone back, he said, Go back also to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon hath made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people: or go wheresoever it seemeth convenient unto thee to go. So the captain of the guard gave him victuals and a reward, and let him go.</p>
<p>Then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land.</p>
<p>Now when all the captains of the forces which were in the fields, even they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed unto him men, and women, and children, and of the poor of the land, of them that were not carried away captive to Babylon;</p>
<p>Then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Careah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men.</p>
<p>And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan sware unto them and to their men, saying, Fear not to serve the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.</p>
<p>As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah to serve the Chaldeans, which will come unto us: but ye, gather ye wine, and summer fruits, and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that ye have taken.</p>
<p>Likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the Ammonites, and in Edom, and that were in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan;</p>
<p>Even all the Jews returned out of all places whither they were driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, unto Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruits very much.</p>
<p>Moreover Johanan the son of Careah, and all the captains of the forces that were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah,</p>
<p>And said unto him, Dost thou certainly know that Baalis the king of the Ammonites hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to slay thee? But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not.</p>
<p>Then Johanan the son of Careah spake to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying, Let me go, I pray thee, and I will slay Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know it: wherefore should he slay thee, that all the Jews which are gathered unto thee should be scattered, and the remnant in Judah perish?</p>
<p>But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said unto Johanan the son of Careah, Thou shalt not do this thing: for thou speakest falsely of Ishmael.</p>
<p>Now it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, and the princes of the king, even ten men with him, came unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they did eat bread together in Mizpah.</p>
<p>Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that were with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword, and slew him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.</p>
<p>Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him, even with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found there, and the men of war.</p>
<p>And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah, and no man knew it,</p>
<p>That there came certain from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even fourscore men, having their beards shaven, and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with offerings and incense in their hand, to bring them to the house of the Dominus.</p>
<p>And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and it came to pass, as he met them, he said unto them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.</p>
<p>And it was so, when they came into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them, and cast them into the midst of the pit, he, and the men that were with him.</p>
<p>But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael, Slay us not: for we have treasures in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he forbare, and slew them not among their brethren.</p>
<p>Now the pit wherein Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men, whom he had slain because of Gedaliah, was it which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with them that were slain.</p>
<p>Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that were in Mizpah, even the king's daughters, and all the people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the Ammonites.</p>
<p>But when Johanan the son of Careah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,</p>
<p>Then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon.</p>
<p>Now it came to pass, that when all the people which were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Careah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, then they were glad.</p>
<p>So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah cast about and returned, and went unto Johanan the son of Careah.</p>
<p>But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the Ammonites.</p>
<p>Then took Johanan the son of Careah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after that he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, even mighty men of war, and the women, and the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought again from Gibeon:</p>
<p>And they went, and dwelt in the habitation of Chimham, which is by Bethlehem, to go to enter into Egypt:</p>
<p>Because of the Chaldeans: for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor in the land.</p>
<p>Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of Careah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even unto the greatest, came near,</p>
<p>And said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us unto the Dominus thy Deus, even for all this remnant; (for we are left but a few of many, as thine eyes do behold us:)</p>
<p>That the Dominus thy Deus may shew us the way wherein we may walk, and the thing that we may do.</p>
<p>Then Jeremiah the prophet said unto them, I have heard you; behold, I will pray unto the Dominus your Deus according to your words; and it shall come to pass, that whatsoever thing the Dominus shall answer you, I will declare it unto you; I will keep nothing back from you.</p>
<p>Then they said to Jeremiah, The Dominus be a true and faithful witness between us, if we do not even according to all things for the which the Dominus thy Deus shall send thee to us.</p>
<p>Whether it be good, or whether it be evil, we will obey the voice of the Dominus our Deus, to whom we send thee; that it may be well with us, when we obey the voice of the Dominus our Deus.</p>
