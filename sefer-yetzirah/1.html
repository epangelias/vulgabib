                    <p>Thirty-two paths of wisdom hath Yah, the Lord of Hosts, God of Israel, the Living God, El Shaddai, merciful and gracious, God of heaven and earth.</p>
<p>Merely by His intention, He created three Sepharim: Bereshith, Yetzirah, and Temurah.</p>
<p>He created His universe by three sepharim, namely, Sefar, Sippur, and Sapher.</p>
<p>The Sepharim are ten in number, and they are reduced to three heads, namely, Ammah, the Father; Ruach, the Spirit; and Neshamah, the Breath.</p>
<p>These ten Sepharim are one in the unity of God, and they are the foundation of all things.</p>
<p>They are the ten fingers of God, and they are the ten utterances by which God created the universe.</p>
<p>One is the Spirit of the Living God, blessed be He, and in His unity, He is the fountain of all life.</p>
<p>Before Him, there was no other, and after Him, there will be none other.</p>
<p>His kingdom is an eternal kingdom, and His throne is a throne of glory, and He is the Lord of all lords, and the King of all kings.</p>
