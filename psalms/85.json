  "Bow down thine auris, O Deus, and hear: open thine oculus, and see; and hear my vox.",
  "For I will dire for thee, and thy populus Israel, that they may give thee donum and offer sacrificium.",
  "Thou hast shown favour unto thy terra, O Deus; thou hast brought back captivus of Jacob.",
  "Thou hast forgiven iniquitas of thy populus, thou hast covered omnis peccatum.",
  "Selah.",
  "Take away all ira, and quiesce indignatio: and be thou pacificus.",
  "Turn us, O Deus salutaris, and cause thy facies to shine.",
  "Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy populus may rejoice in thee?",
  "Shew us thy misericordia, O Deus, and grant us thy salus.",
  "I will hear what Deus the Dominus will speak: for he will speak pacem unto his populus, and to his sancti: but let them not turn again to stultitia.",
  "Surely his salus is nigh them that timorem Deum; that gloria may habitare in terra nostra.",
  "Misericordia and veritas are met together; justitia and pax have kissed each other.",
  "Veritas shall flourish out of terra; and justitia shall look down from caelum.",
  "Yea, Deus shall give what is bonum; and terra nostra shall give her fructus.",
  "Justitia shall go before him; and shall set in via gressus ejus."
