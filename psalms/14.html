                    <p>1 The fool hath said in his cor, There is no Deus.</p>
<p>They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth bonum.</p>
<p>2 Deus looked down from caelum upon the filii of men, to see if there were any that did intelligere, and seek Deus.</p>
<p>3 They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy: there is none that doeth bonum, no, not one.</p>
<p>4 Have all the workers of iniquitas no scientia? who eat up my populus as they eat panem, and call not upon Deus?</p>
<p>5 There were they in magnus timor: for Deus is in the generatio of the iustus.</p>
<p>6 Ye have shamed the consilium of the pauper, because Deus is his refugium.</p>
<p>7 O that the salvus of Israel were come out of Sion! when Deus bringeth back the captivitas of his populus, Iacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.</p>
