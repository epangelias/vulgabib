  "1. Then Job answered and said, Hear, I beseech you, my vocatio, and attend to the disputatio of my lips.",
  "2. For I am full of sermones, and the Spirit of me forces me to speak.",
  "3. I will speak, that I may find a consolatio for my animus: and my os shall show the sinceritas of my mouth.",
  "4. For I know not to speak thus, that I am a pecunia, that the libertas of my dictum I should suppress.",
  "5. For who is this that hideth the veritas, and speaketh not in the fidelitas of his cor?",
  "6. Hear now my sermones, and attend to the disputatio of my labia.",
  "7. O see that I have in my manus the Spirit of Deum, and that the inspiratio of the Omnipotens hath not given me the sapientia.",
  "8. Yea, the longaevus are not now in the terra, and the sapientes are not now in the days of antiquus.",
  "9. Dicimus enim sapientia, and from antiquus we have the scientia.",
  "10. But there is a Spirit in homo, and the inspiratio of the Omnipotens him giveth the intellectus.",
  "11. For the grandaevus, not always have the sapientia, neque semper seniores intellegunt iudicium.",
  "12. Behold, I have seen the sapientia, and she is not in the terra: for the largitas of Deum is above the terra.",
  "13. With him is fortitudo and sapientia: the ipse is Counsellor and potens.",
  "14. Whatsoever he destroyeth, it shall not be built: and whomsoever he shutteth up, shall not be opened.",
  "15. Behold, he withholdeth the aquas, and they dry up: also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the terra.",
  "16. With him is fortitudo and sapientia: the ipse is Counsellor and potens.",
  "17. He leadeth the principes away spoiled, and the iudices of the terra he maketh fooles.",
  "18. He looseth the ligamina of reges, and girdeth their lumbos with a cingulum.",
  "19. He leadeth away the sacerdotes, and overthroweth the potentes.",
  "20. He removeth the fides of the loquentes, and taketh away the intellectus of the seniores.",
  "21. He poureth contemptus upon the principes, and weakeneth the fortitudo of the potentes.",
  "22. He discovereth the profunda of the tenebrae, and bringeth out to the lumen the umbram.",
  "23. He multiplieth the gentes, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth the gentes, and disperseth them.",
  "24. He taketh away the intellectus of the principes of the terra, and maketh them err in a desertum without a via.",
  "25. They grope in the tenebrae without the lumen, and he maketh them to stagger like a homo ebrius."
