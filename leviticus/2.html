                    <p>And when any will offer a meat offering unto the Deus, his offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense thereon.</p>
<p>And he shall bring it to the sacerdotes, the filii of Aaron: and he shall take thereout his handful of the flour thereof, and of the oleum thereof, with all the frankincense thereof; and the sacerdos shall burn the memorial of it upon the altare, to be a sweet savour unto the Deus:</p>
<p>And the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his filii eat: with unleavened panis shall it be eaten in the loco sancto: in the atrium of the tabernaculum of the congregation they shall eat it.</p>
<p>It shall not be baked with fermentum. I have given it unto them for their pars of my oblationis made by fire; it is most sanctum, as is the peccatum offering, and as the expiatio offering.</p>
<p>All the masculus filii of Aaron shall eat of it. It shall be a statutum for ever in your generation concerning the oblationis of the Deus: every thing that toucheth them shall be sanctum.</p>
<p>And this is the lex of the meat offering: the filii of Aaron shall offer it before the Deus, before the altare.</p>
<p>And he shall take of it his handful, of the flour of the meat offering, and of the oleum thereof, and all the frankincense which is upon the meat offering, and shall burn it upon the altare for a sweet savour, even the memorial of it, unto the Deus.</p>
<p>And the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his filii eat: with unleavened panis shall it be eaten in the loco sancto.</p>
<p>It shall not be baked with fermentum. It is most sanctum of the oblationis of the Deus made by fire: all that toucheth them shall be sanctum.</p>
<p>And the sacerdos that offereth any man's meat offering, even the sacerdos shall have it unto himself.</p>
<p>And every meat offering, mingled with oleum, and dry, shall all the filii of Aaron have, one as much as another.</p>
<p>And this is the lex of the sacrificium of pacification, which he shall offer unto the Deus.</p>
<p>If he offer it for a gratiarum actionem, then he shall offer with the sacrificium of pacification uncooked panis mingled with oleum, and unleavened wafers anointed with oleum, and cakes mingled with oleum, of fine flour fried.</p>
<p>Besides the cakes, he shall offer for his oblation leavened panis with the sacrificium of pacification of his gratiarum actionem:</p>
<p>One cake of the whole oblation for the sacerdos that sprinkleth the sanguinem of the pacification.</p>
<p>And the flesh of the sacrificium of his pacification for gratiarum actionem shall be eaten the same day that it is offered; he shall not leave any of it until the cras: but if any remain of the flesh of the sacrificium until the tertius day, it shall be burnt in the ignis.</p>
<p>And if any of the flesh of the sacrificium of his pacification for gratiarum actionem be eaten at all on the tertius day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth it: it shall be an abomination, and the anima that eateth of it shall bear iniquitas.</p>
<p>Moreover the flesh that toucheth any thing unclean shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt in the ignis: and as for the flesh, all that be clean shall eat thereof.</p>
<p>But the anima that eateth of the flesh of the sacrificium of pacification, that pertaineth unto the Deus, having his uncleanness upon him, even that anima shall be exterminata from among his populus.</p>
<p>Moreover the anima that shall touch any thing unclean, as the uncleanness of homo, or any unclean animal, or any abominable filthy thing, and eat of the flesh of the sacrificium of pacification, which pertaineth unto the Deus, even that anima shall be exterminata from among his populus.</p>
