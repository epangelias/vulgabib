                    <p>And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph, Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.</p>
<p>And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.</p>
<p>And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,</p>
<p>And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.</p>
<p>And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Aegyptum, before I came unto thee into Aegyptum, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.</p>
<p>And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.</p>
<p>And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is Bethlehem.</p>
<p>And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?</p>
<p>And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom Deus hath given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will benedicere them.</p>
<p>Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.</p>
<p>And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, Deus hath shewed me also thy semen.</p>
<p>And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.</p>
<p>And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him.</p>
<p>And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's caput, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's caput, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn.</p>
<p>And he blessed them, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, Deus make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.</p>
<p>And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but Deus shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your patres.</p>
<p>Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my gladius and with my arcus.</p>
<p>And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his pedes into the bed, and expired, and was gathered unto his populus.</p>
