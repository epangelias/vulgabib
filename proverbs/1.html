                    <p>The words of Solomon, filius David, rex Israel, sapientia docens, 'Hear, filii, the instruction of a pater, and attend to know prudentiam;</p>
<p>For I give you bona monita, forsake not my doctrina.</p>
<p>For I was a filius to my pater, tender and unicus in the sight of my mater;</p>
<p>He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thy cor hold fast my verba, keep my mandata, and live;</p>
<p>Acquire sapientiam, acquire intellectum, forget not, neither decline from the verba of my os;</p>
<p> Forsake her not, and she shall keep thee, amor her, and she shall preserve thee.</p>
<p>The beginning of sapientia is, Get sapientiam, and with all thy facultas, get intellectum.</p>
<p>Exalt sapientiam, and she shall promote thee, she shall bring thee honor, when thou dost embraciar her.</p>
<p>She shall give to thy caput an ornament of gratia, a corona of gloria.</p>
<p>Hear, O filius, and receive my verba, and the anni of thy vita shall be multiplied.</p>
<p>I have taught thee in via sapientiae, I have led thee in rectis semitis.</p>
<p>When thou goest, thy gressus shall not be angusti, and when thou runnest, thou shalt not fall.</p>
<p>Take fast hold of doctrina, let her not go, keep her, for she is vita.</p>
<p>Enter not into via malorum, and walk not in semita malorum.</p>
<p>Decline from it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.</p>
<p>For they sleep not, nisi they have done malum, and their somnus is taken away, nisi they cause some to fall.</p>
<p>For they eat panis malorum, and bibunt vinum violentiae.</p>
<p>But the semita of iusti is sicut lux splendens, quae procedit, et crescit in dies.</p>
<p>The way of malorum is tenebrae, they know not in quo offendunt.</p>
<p>My filius, attend to my verba, inclina thy aurem to my eloquia;</p>
<p>Let them not recedere from thine oculi, keep them in medio cordis tui.</p>
<p>For they are vita to those that find them, and sanitas to all their carne.</p>
<p>Keep thy cor with omni custodia, for out of it are the issues of vita.</p>
<p>Put away from thee a lingua malivolus, and perverbum labiis tuis remove.</p>
<p>Let thine oculi look recte on, and thy palpebrae look recte before thee.</p>
<p>Ponder the semitam of thy pedes, and let all thy viae be stabiles.</p>
<p>Decline not to dexteram aut sinistram, remove thy pedem from malum.</p>
