                    <p>1 Hear me when I call, O Deus meus, and graciously hear me, and give ear unto me, when I call.</p>
<p>2 O filii hominum, how long will ye turn my gloria into ignomia, how long will ye love vanitatem, and seek after mendacium?</p>
<p>3 But know that Dominus hath set apart the sanctus for himselfe: the Dominus will hear when I call unto him.</p>
<p>4 Stand in awe, and sinne not: commune with your own cor, upon your lectus, and be still. Selah.</p>
<p>5 Offer the sacrificia of iustitiam, and put your trust in Dominus.</p>
<p>6 There be many that say, Quis ostendit nobis bona? but thou, O Dominus, hast lifted up the lumen vultus tui upon us.</p>
<p>7 Thou hast put gloria in my cor, more than in the tempus when their frumentum and vinum increased.</p>
<p>8 I will both lay me downe in pace, and take my somnus: for thou, O Dominus, only makest me dwell in securitate.</p>
