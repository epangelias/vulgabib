                    <p>Tikkun, in principio, God creavit the heavens and the earth.</p>
<p>And the earth erat without form, and void; and tenebrae was upon the faciem of the deep. And the Spirit of God movebatur upon the faciem of the waters.</p>
<p>And God dixit, Let there be lux: and there was lux.</p>
<p>And God vidit the lux, that it erat bonum: and God divisit the lux from the tenebrae.</p>
<p>And God appellavit the lux, Dies: and the tenebrae, he appelavit Nox. And there was vespere, and there was mane, dies unus.</p>
