  "Unto the angel of the ecclesia in Ephesus write; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stellarum and walketh in the midst of the seven golden candelabra;",
  "I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patientia, and how thou canst not bear them which are malum, and hast tried them which say they are apostoli, and are not, and hast found them mendacem;",
  "Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the prima opera; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candelabrum out of his locus, except thou repent;",
  "But this thou hast, that thou hatest the works of the Nicolaitanes, which I also hate;",
  "He that hath an auris, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the ecclesiae;",
  "To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the lignum vitae, which is in the paradisus of Deus;",
  "And unto the angel of the ecclesia in Smyrna write; These things saith the primus and the novissimus, which was dead, and is alive;",
  "I know thy works, and tribulation, and povertatem, (but thou art divitiae) and I know the blasphemia of them which say they are Iudaei, and are not, but are the synagoga of Satan;",
  " Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the diabolus shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tempted, and ye shall have tribulation decem dies: be thou fidelis unto mortem, and I will give thee coronam vitae;",
  "He that hath an auris, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the ecclesiae;",
  "He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the secunda mors;",
  "And to the angel of the ecclesia in Pergamos write; These things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges;",
  "I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, even where Satan's throne is: and thou holdest fast my nomine, and hast not denied my fides, even in those days wherein Antipas was my fidelis martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth;",
  "But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrina of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumbling-block before the filii Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornicatio;",
  "Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my os;",
  "He that hath an auris, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the ecclesiae;",
  "To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the manna absconditum, and will give him a calculus white, and in the calculus a novum nomine written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it;",
  "And unto the angel of the ecclesia in Thyatira write; These things saith the Filius Dei, who hath oculos like unto a flamma ignis, and his pedes are like fine brass;",
  "I know thy works, and caritatem, and service, and fides, and thy patientia, and thy works; and the last more than the prima;",
  "Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Iezabel, which calleth herself a prophetissa, to teach and to seduce my servos to commit fornicatio, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols;",
  "And I gave her spatiem to repent of her fornicatio; and she repented not.",
  "In semel I will cast her into a lectus, and them that commit adulterium with her into magnum tribulation, except they repent of their opera;",
  "And I will kill her filii with mortem; and all the ecclesiae shall know that I am he which searcheth the renes and corda: and I will give unto every one of you according to your opera;",
  "But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrina, and which have not known the profundum Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden;",
  "But that which ye have already hold fast till I come;",
  "And he that overcometh, and keepeth my opera unto the finem, to him will I give potestatem over the gentes;",
  "And he shall regnare them with a virga ferrea; as the vas fidelis is broken to shivers;",
  "Even thus shall the gens of the electi be broken;",
  "He that hath an auris, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the ecclesiae."
