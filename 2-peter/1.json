  "Simon Peter, a servus and an apostolus of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious fides through the iustitia of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:",
  "Grace and pax be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord, according as his divitiae hath given unto us all things that pertain unto vita and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to gloria and virtus:",
  "Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promissio: that by these ye might be partakers of the divinae naturae, having escaped the corruption that is in the mundo through concupiscentia:",
  "Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your vocatio and electio sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never stumble:",
  "For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the aeternum regnum of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.",
  "Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be established in the present veritas.",
  "Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance;",
  "Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me.",
  "Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance.",
  "For we have not followed cunningly devised fabulae, when we made known unto you the potentiam and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his magnificence.",
  "For he received from God the Pater honour and gloria, when there came such a vox to him from the excellent gloria, This is my dilectus Filius, in whom I am well pleased:",
  "And this vox which came from caelum we heard, when we were with him in the holy montem.",
  "But we have the propheticum word more firm, whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a lamp that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the stella of the morning arise in your cordibus:",
  "Knowing this first, that no propheticum scriptura is of any private interpretatio.",
  "For the propheticum scriptura came not in old time by the will of man: but holy homines of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Spiritus."
