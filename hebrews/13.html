                    <p>Let amor fraternal continue.</p>
<p>Do not forget to entertain hospites, for thereby some have entertained angeli unawares.</p>
<p>Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the corpus.</p>
<p>Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.</p>
<p>Let your conversation be without avaritia; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.</p>
<p>So that we may boldly say, The Dominus is my adiutor, and I will not timere what man shall do unto me.</p>
<p>Remember them which have the regula of you, who have spoken the word of Deus unto you: whose fides follow, considering the exitus of their conversatio Jesum Christum.</p>
<p>Jesus Christus yesterday, and to day, and for ever.</p>
<p>Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrinae. For it is a good thing that the cor of the sancti hath gratia, whereby we are not destitute of any beneficium.</p>
<p>We have an altar, whereof they have no potestas to eat which serve the tabernacle.</p>
<p>Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the populum with his own sanguinem, suffered without the porta.</p>
<p>Let us go forth therefore unto him without the castra, bearing his reproach.</p>
<p>For here have we no continuing civitas, but we seek one to come.</p>
<p>By him therefore let us offer the sacrificium of laudis always to Deus; that is, the fructus of lips giving thanks to his nomine.</p>
<p>But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrificia Deus is well pleased.</p>
<p>Obey them that have the regula over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your animae, as they that must give an rationem, that they may do it with gaudium, and not with gemens.</p>
<p>Pray for us: for we trust we have a bona conscientia, in omnibus willing to live honestly.</p>
<p>Heb 13:19 But I beseech you the more to do this, that I may be restored to you the more velociter.</p>
<p>Salute all them that have the potestas over you, and all the sancti. They of Italia salute you.</p>
<p>Gratia be with you all. Amen.</p>
