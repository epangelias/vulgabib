  "It is reported commonly that there is fornicatio among you, and such fornicatio as is not so much as named among the gentes, that one should have the uxor of his pater.",
  "It is heard among you, and I do not commendo, that ye have contentiones among you.",
  "And this I say to you, that no temptatio shall befall you, but such as is humana: but Deus is fidelis, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptatio also make a via of egress, that ye may be able to bear it.",
  "For if any man see thee who hast scientia sit at mensa in the templum of an idolum, shall not the conscientia of him which is infirmus be edified to eat of the things which are sacrificata to idola;",
  "Lest peradventure for the scientia of him which is infirmus, the fratres for whom Cristus mortuus est shall periire.",
  "But to the pusillus we must not offend, no, nor the ecclesia of Deus, that thou mayest be eximius, as also we: to them which are pusilli in fide we must accommodate our selves, to this finis that we may salvare animas;",
  "And not that which is not the salus of omnis homo: qui dixit, omnes nos scimus: sed non omnes habemus scientiam.",
  "Per fidem, let not him which eateth, contemn him that eateth not: and let not him which eateth not, judicare him that eateth: for Deus is ipse judicabit eum;",
  "But si aliquis uxor, frater, vel soror habet qui est infidelis, et ille vult mansio in domo sua, ne eiciat: non enim salus Deus potuit ei: qui est infidelis aut infidela: quia scitis, fratres, quod in pacis amore erimus in uxor, aut in amicis et parentibus nostris."
