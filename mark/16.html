                    <p>1 After He riseth from mortis, Jesus autem apparuit primus Mariæ Magdalenæ, quæ eiecerat septem daemonia.</p>
<p>2 And she went and told them that had been with Him, as they mourned and wept.</p>
<p>3 And they, when they had heard that He was vivus and had been seen of her, believed not.</p>
<p>4 After that, He appeared in another form to two of them, as they walked and went into the villa.</p>
<p>5 And they went and told it to the others, and neither believed they them.</p>
<p>6 After that, He appeared unto the undecim as they sat at mensa, and rebuked them for their incredulitas, because they believed not them which had seen Him after He was resurrectus.</p>
<p>7 He said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behooved Christum to suffer and rise again tertius dies:</p>
<p>8 That repentantia and remissio peccatorum should be preached in His nomine among omnes gentes, beginning at Ierusalem.</p>
<p>9 And He said unto them, You are witnesses of these res: and behold, I send the promissum Patris upon you: but tarry you in urbs, until you be endued with potentia ex alto.</p>
<p>10 And as they followed, He was assumptus in coelum, and they worshiped Him and returned to Ierusalem cum gaudio.</p>
<p>15 And He said unto them, Go ye into totus mundus, and prædicate Evangelium omni creaturæ.</p>
<p>16 Qui crediderit et fuerit baptizatus, salvus erit; qui vero non crediderit, condemnatus erit.</p>
<p>17 Signa autem sequentia erunt, eos qui crediderint: in nomine meo dæmonia eicient; linguis loquentur novis;</p>
<p>18 serpentibus ardentibus manibus comprehendere, et si quid mortiferum biberint, non eis nocebit; super ægros manus inponent, et bene habebunt.</p>
<p>19 Et Dominus quidem Iesus, postquam locutus est eis, assumptus est in coelum, et sedet a dextris Dei.</p>
<p>20 Illi autem egressi, prædicaverunt ubique, Domino cooperante, et sermonem confirmante per sequentia signa. Amen.</p>
