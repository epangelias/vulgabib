                    <p>Again there was a day when the sons of Deus came to present themselves before the Dominus, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the Dominus.</p>
<p>And the Dominus said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered the Dominus, and said, From going to and fro in the terra, and from walking up and down in it.</p>
<p>And the Dominus said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the terra, a man simplex and rectus, and fearing Deus, and eschewing malum?</p>
<p>And Satan answered the Dominus, and said, Doth Job fear Deus for nought?</p>
<p>Hast not thou made a hedge about him, and about his domus, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the opus of his manus, and his substance is increased in the terra.</p>

<p>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camelos, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servi with the mouth of the gladius; and I only am escaped to tell thee.</p>
<p>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy filii and thy filiae were eating and drinking vinum in the domus of their fratres elder;</p>
<p>And, behold, there came a great ventus from beyond the desert, and smote the four corners of the domus, and it fell upon the young men, and they are mortui; and I only am escaped to tell thee.</p>
<p>Then Job arose, and rent his vestimenta, and shaved his caput, and fell upon the terra, and worshipped,</p>
