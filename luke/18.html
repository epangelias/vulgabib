                    <p>And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his discipuli were with him: and he asked them, Quid vultis me facere?</p>
<p>But they knew not what to respond, for timor had taken hold on them.</p>
<p>And, behold, a certain homo, whose filius was possessed with a spiritus immundus, cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee, look on my filius: for he is mine unicus.</p>
<p>And, lo, a spiritus takes him, and he suddenly cries out; and it tears him that he foams again, and bruising him hardly departs from him.</p>
<p>And I besought thy discipuli to cast him out; and they could not.</p>
<p>And Jesus answering said, O generatio incredula et perversa, how long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring thy filius hither.</p>
<p>And as he was yet a coming, the daemonium rent him and convulsed him. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spiritus, and healed the puer, and delivered him again to his pater.</p>
<p>And they were all astonisati at the magnificent virtus of God. But while they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said unto his discipuli,</p>
<p>Let these sermones sink down into your aures: for the Filius hominis shall be delivered into the manus of homines.</p>
<p>But they understood not this sermonem: and it was absconditus from them, that they perceived it not: and they feared to interrogate him of this sermonem.</p>
<p>And there arose a disputatio among them, which of them should be the maior.</p>
<p>But when Jesus saw the cogitationes of their corda, he took a puer, and set him by him,</p>
<p>And said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this puer in my nomine, receives me: and whosoever shall receive me, receives him that sent me: for he that is minimus among you all, the same shall be magnus.</p>
<p>And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out daemonia in thy nomine; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us.</p>
<p>And Jesus said unto him, Forbid him not: for he that is not contra you is pro you.</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when the tempus was come that he should be received up, he stetit in facie his itineris to go to Jerusalem,</p>
<p>And sent messengers before his facies: and they went, and entered into a castellum of Samaritanorum, to make ready for him.</p>
<p>And they did not receive him, because his facies was as though he would go to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>And when his discipuli James and John saw this, they said, Domine, vis we command ignem to descend from caelum, and consume them, even as Elias did?</p>
<p>But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, You know not what spiritus you are of.</p>
<p>For the Filius hominis is not come to perdere animas, but to salvare them. And they went to another castellum.</p>
<p>And it came to pass, that, as they went in the via, a certain homo said unto him, Domine, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.</p>
<p>And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have dens, and aves of the caelum have nests; but the Filius hominis hath not where to lay his caput.</p>
<p>And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Domine, permit me first to go and sepelire my pater.</p>
<p>Jesus said unto him, Let the mortui sepelire their mortuos: but go thou and announce the regnum of Deum.</p>
<p>And another also said, Domine, I will follow thee; but let me first bid farewell to them which are in my domus.</p>
<p>Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his manus to the aratrum, and looking back, is aptus for the regnum of Deum.</p>
