  "And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the Lord appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Omnipotens Deus, walk before me, and be thou perfect.",
  "And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly, et multiplicabo te vehementer.",
  "And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying, As for me, behold, my pactum is with thee, and thou shalt be a pater multarum gentium.",
  "Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; quia patrem multarum gentium constitui te.",
  "And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, et multiplicabo te, and I will make nations of thee, and reges shall come out of thee.",
  "And I will establish my pactum between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an aeternum pactum, to be a Deus unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.",
  "And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a peregrinus, all the land of Canaan, for an aeternum possession; and I will be their Deus.",
  "And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my pactum therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations.",
  "This is my pactum, which ye shall keep between me and you and thy seed after thee; every masculus among you shall be circumcisus.",
  "And ye shall circumcidere the prepucium of your filius, and it shall be a signum of the pactum betwixt me and you.",
  "And he that is octo dierum old shall be circumcisus among you, every masculus in your generations, he that is genitus in the domus, or bought with pecunia of any stranger, which is not of thy seed.",
  "He that is genitus in thy domus, and he that is bought with thy pecunia, must needs be circumcisus: and my pactum shall be in your carne for an aeternum pactum.",
  "And the uncircumcisus masculus whose prepucium is not circumcisus, that anima shall be cut off from his populus; he hath broken my pactum.",
  "And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy uxor, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sara shall her name be.",
  "And I will bless her, and give thee a filius also of her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be the mater of gentes; reges of people shall be of her.",
  "Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his cor, Shall a filius be born unto him that is centum years old? and shall Sara, that is nonaginta years old, bear?",
  "And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before thee!",
  "And God said, Sara thy uxor shall bear thee a filius indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my pactum with him for an aeternum pactum, and with his seed after him.",
  "And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fructuosus, and will multiply him exceedingly; duodecim principes shall he beget, and I will make him a magnam gentem.",
  "But my pactum will I establish with Isaac, whom Sara shall bear unto thee at this tempus in the annum following.",
  "And he left off talking with him, and God ascended from Abraham.",
  "And Abraham took Ishmael his filius, and all that were geniti in his domus, and all that were bought with his pecunia, every masculus among the homines of Abraham's domus; and circumcidit the prepucium of their carne in the selfsame die, as God had spoken unto him.",
  "Abraham was nonaginta and nine years old, when he was circumcisus in the carne of his prepucium.",
  "And Ishmael his filius was thirteen years old, when he was circumcisus in the carne of his prepucium.",
  "In the selfsame die was Abraham circumcisus, and Ishmael his filius.",
  "And all the viri of his domus, born in the domus, and bought with pecunia of the stranger, were circumcisi with him."
