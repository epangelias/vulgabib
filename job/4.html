                    <p>Then Eliphaz the Temptator answered and said, If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking?</p>
<p>Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.</p>
<p>Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.</p>
<p>But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.</p>
<p>Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways?</p>
<p>Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?</p>
<p>Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.</p>
<p>By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his indignation are they consumed.</p>
<p>The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the feram (ferox) , and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.</p>
<p>The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lions are wandering.</p>
<p>The tabernacula (tabernaculum) of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure; into whose hand God bringeth abundantly.</p>
<p>But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the aves (avis) of the air, and they shall tell thee:</p>
<p>Or speak to the terra (terra) , and it shall teach thee: and the pisces (piscis) of the sea shall declare unto thee.</p>
<p>Who knoweth not in all these that the manus (manus) of the Lord hath wrought this?</p>
<p>In whose manus (manus) is the anima (anima) of every vivens (vivens) thing, and the spiritus (spiritus) of all mankind.</p>
<p>Doth not the aurem (aurem) discern words? and the palatum (palatum) tasteth his cibus (cibus) ?</p>
<p>With the senes (senex) is wisdom; and in length of dies (dies) understanding.</p>
<p>With him is sapientia (sapientia) and potentia (potentia) , he hath consilium (consilium) and intellectus (intellectus) .</p>
<p>Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again: he shutteth up a homo (homo) , and there can be no opening.</p>
<p>Behold, he withholdeth the aquas (aqua) , and they dry up: also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the terra (terra) .</p>
<p>With him is potentia (potentia) and sapientia (sapientia) : the seductor (seducere) and the seductus (seducere) are his.</p>
<p>He leadeth consiliarii (consiliarius) away spoiled, and judices (judex) maketh he foolish.</p>
<p>He looseth the cingulum (cingulum) of reges (rex) , and girdeth their lumbi (lumbus) with a funiculus (funiculus) .</p>
<p>He leadeth sacerdotes (sacerdos) away spoiled, and overthroweth potentis (potens) .</p>
<p>He removeth the fidem (fides) of the vetus (vetus) , and taketh away the scientia (scientia) of the senes (senex) .</p>
<p>He poureth contemptum (contemptus) upon principes (princeps) , and maketh them vagari (vagari) in a desolatum (desolatus) land.</p>
<p>He taketh away the lumen (lumen) from the facies (facies) of the terra (terra) , and maketh the imagines (imago) of the gentes (gens) to be as umbra (umbra) .</p>
<p>All these things worketh God oftentimes with homo (homo) , and causeth them to ascend to judicium (judicium) , that he may manifest them in their via (via) .</p>
