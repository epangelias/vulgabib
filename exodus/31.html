                    <p>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, See, I have called by nomine Bezaleel the filius of Uri, the filius of Hur, of the tribus of Judah:</p>
<p>And I have replenished him with the spiritus of God, in sapientia, and in intelligentia, and in scientia, and in omni opere,</p>
<p>To devise ingeniosa, to work in aurum, and in argentum, and in aes,</p>
<p>And in caedere lapides, to set them in auro, and in argentum, and in aes, and in lignis, to work in omni opere ingenioso.</p>
<p>And, behold, I have given with him Aholiab the filius of Ahisamach, of the tribus of Dan: and in the corde of all that are sapientes corde I have put sapientiam, that they may facere all that I have commanded thee;</p>
<p>The tabernaculum of conventus, and the arca of the testimonium, and the propitiatorium that is thereupon, and all the vessels of the tabernaculum,</p>
<p>And the vestes of the ministerium, to minister in sanctuario, and the vestes of Aaron the pontifex, and the vestes of his filii, to minister in sacerdotio;</p>
<p>And the oleum of the unctio, and the incensum of the aromata, to the opus of the sanctuario: according to all that I have commanded thee shall they facere.</p>
<p>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, Speak thou also unto the filii of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbata ye shall keep: for it is a signe between me and you throughout your generationen; that ye may know that I am the LORD that sanctifieth you.</p>
<p>Ye shall keep the sabbatum therefore; for it is sanctum unto you: every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for whosoever doth any opus therein, that anima shall be cut off from among his populus.</p>
<p>Six dies shall opus be done, but on the seventh dies is a sabbatum of rest, sanctum to the LORD: whosoever doth any opus in the sabbatum dies, he shall surely be put to death.</p>
<p>Wherefore the filii of Israel shall keep the sabbatum, to observe the sabbatum throughout their generationen, for a pactum aeternum.</p>
<p>It is a signe between me and the filii of Israel for ever: for in six dies the LORD made caelum and terram, and on the seventh dies he rested, and was refreshed.</p>
<p>And he gave unto Moses, when he had finished speaking with him upon mount Sinai, two tabulae of the testimonium, tabulae of lapidem, written with the digitus of God.</p>
