  "And I saw in the dexteram of Him that sat on the throne a libellus, written within and on the backside, sealed with septem seals.",
  "And I saw a strong Angel proclaiming with a loud vox, Who is worthy to open the libellus, and to loose the septem seals thereof?",
  "And no man in caelum, nor in terra, neither under the terra, was able to open the libellus, neither to look thereon.",
  "And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the libellum, neither to look thereon.",
  "And one of the seniores saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Leo of the tribe of Iuda, the radix David, hath prevailed to open the libellus, and to loose the septem seals thereof.",
  "And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the quatuor beasts, and in the midst of the seniores, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having septem cornua and septem oculi, which are the septem Spiritus of God sent forth into all the terra.",
  "And He came and took the libellus out of the dexteram of Him that sat upon the throne.",
  "And when He had taken the libellus, the quatuor beasts and the twenty-four seniores fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harpae and golden vasa full of odorem.",
  "And they sung a novum canticum, saying, Thou art worthy to take the libellum, and to open the septem seals thereof: for Thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy sanguinem out of every tribus, and lingua, and populus, and natio;",
  "And hast made us unto our Deus reges and sacerdotes: and we shall reign on the terra."
