  "When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider diligently him that is set over thee, and put a knife to thy 'gula' (throat).",
  "Be not desirous of his 'dainty' (dainty) meats: for they are 'deceptio' (deceit).",
  "Labour not to be 'dives' (rich), cease from thy own 'ingenium' (wisdom).",
  "For riches certainly make themselves 'volucres' (wings); they fly away as an 'aquila' (eagle) toward 'caelum' (heaven).",
  "As a 'rostrum' (snare) for the taking of 'avis' (birds), so is the 'laqueus' (snare) of the 'venator' (hunter) in the 'convivium' (banquet) of the 'dives' (rich man) for the taking of the 'anima' (soul).",
  "Eat thou not the 'panis' (bread) of him that hath an 'odium' (eye) evil, neither desire thou his 'dainty' (dainty) meats:",
  "For as he thinketh in his 'anima' (soul) within himself, so is he: Eat and 'bibere' (drink), saith he to thee; but his 'cor' (heart) is not with thee.",
  "The 'morsus' (morsel) which thou hast eaten shalt thou 'evomere' (vomit up), and 'perdere' (lose) thy 'suavis' (sweet) words.",
  "Speak not in the 'auris' (ears) of a 'stultus' (fool): for he will despise the 'sapientia' (wisdom) of thy words.",
  "Remove not the 'metas' (bound) of thy 'progenitor' (father): and enter not the 'agri' (fields) of the 'pater' (fatherless).",

  "Apply thine 'auris' (ear) to my words, and 'tende' (stretch) thy 'cor' (heart) to my 'sapientia' (wisdom).",
  "That thy 'anima' (soul) may be 'delicias' (delighted) in 'prosperitas' (prosperity), and thy 'corporeus' (body) in 'bonitas' (goodness).",
  "My 'filius' (son), give me thine 'cor' (heart), and let thine 'oculi' (eyes) observe my ways.",
  "For a 'fornix' (whore) is a deep 'puteus' (ditch): and a 'mulier' (woman) with a 'secretum' (secret) is a narrow 'pit' (pit).",
  "Also she 'liquet' (lies) in 'via' (way), waiting as for 'praeda' (prey) of those whom she hath in her 'animus' (soul); she increases the 'numero' (number) of the 'prodigus' (wasteful).",
  "Who hath 'pessimum' (woe), who hath 'tenebra' (grief), who hath 'plaga' (wounds) without 'causa' (cause)? who hath those things that I mentioned in 'duodecimo' (the twelfth) verse?",

  "Avoid them, pass not by them, turn away from them, and 'evita' (escape).",
  "For they sleep not, except they have done 'mala' (evil): and their 'somnus' (sleep) is taken away, unless they cause some to 'fallere' (fall).",
  "They eat the 'panis' (bread) of 'malitia' (malignity), and they drink the 'vinum' (wine) of 'violencia' (violence).",
  "But the 'via' (way) of the 'iustus' (just) is as the 'lumen' (light) of the 'sol' (sun): it 'crescit' (grows) and 'augebit' (augments) unto the 'perfectus' (perfect) day.",
  "The 'via' (way) of the 'impius' (wicked) is as the 'tenebra' (darkness): they know not at what they stumble.",

  "For they are the 'flores' (flowers) of the 'sapientia' (wisdom) and the 'fructus' (fruits) of the 'scientia' (knowledge).",
  "And they shall be 'sapor' (flavor) to thy 'gula' (throat), and as 'vinum' (wine) that goeth down 'suaviter' (sweetly) to thy 'venter' (belly).",
  "Then shalt thou understand the 'sapientia' (wisdom), and the 'dicta' (sayings) of the 'prudentes' (prudent).",

  "As for the 'iustus' (just), they shall 'germinare' (flourish) as a 'palma' (palm tree), and grow as a 'cedrus' (cedar) in 'Libanus' (Lebanon).",
  "Their 'semen' (seed) shall be in the 'terra' (earth), and their 'germen' (germ) shall be in the 'perennis' (perennial) water.",
  "And they shall not be 'timidus' (timid), nor 'formidolosus' (fearful), nor 'sollicitus' (solicitous), nor 'molestus' (troubled).",
  "For they shall be 'plenitudo' (full) of 'gaudium' (joy), and they shall have the 'flores' (flowers) of the 'lectus' (lectus)."
