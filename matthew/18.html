                    <p>At that time the disciples came to Jesus, saying, 'Quis inter nos maior est?'</p>
<p>And Jesus called a parvulus unto him, and set him in the midst of them,</p>
<p>And said, 'Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as parvuli, ye shall not enter into the regnum caelorum.'</p>
<p>Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this parvulus, the same is the maior in the regnum caelorum.</p>
<p>And whoso shall receive one such parvulus in my name receiveth me.</p>
<p>But whoso shall offend one of these parvuli which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the mare.'</p>
<p>Woe unto the mundus because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that homo by whom the offence cometh!</p>
<p>Wherefore if thy manus or thy pes offend thee, cut them off, and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two manus or two pedes to be cast into ignem aeternum.</p>
<p>And if thine oculus offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one oculus, rather than having two oculi to be cast into ignem gehennae.'</p>
<p>Take heed that ye despise not one of these parvuli; for I say unto you, That in caelis their angels do always behold the facies of my Father which is in caelis.'</p>
<p>How think ye? if a homo have an hundred ovium, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the nonaginta novem, and goeth into the montes, and seeketh that which is gone astray?</p>
<p>And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more of that sheep, than of the nonaginta novem which went not astray.</p>
<p>Even so it is not the voluntas of your Father which is in caelis, that one of these parvuli should perish.'</p>
<p>Moreover if thy frater shall trespass against thee, go and monere him between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy frater.'</p>
<p>But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two, that in the os of two or three testes every verbum may be established.'</p>
<p>And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the ecclesia: but if he neglect to hear the ecclesia, let him be unto thee as a gentilis and a publicanus.'</p>
<p>Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind upon terram shall be bound in caelis: and whatsoever ye shall solvere upon terram shall be solved in caelis.'</p>
<p>Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall consent in terra as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in caelis.'</p>
<p>For where two or three are gathered together in my nomine, there am I in medio eorum.'</p>
<p>Then came Peter to him, and said, 'Domine, how oft shall my frater offend against me, and I forgive him? till septies?'</p>
<p>Jesus saith unto him, 'I say not unto thee, Till septies: but, Till septuagies septies.'</p>
<p>Therefore is the regnum caelorum likened unto a homo Rex, which would take account of his servos.'</p>
<p>And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him decem millia talenta.'</p>
<p>But forasmuch as he had not to solve, his dominus commanded him to be sold, and his uxor, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.'</p>
<p>The servus therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, 'Domine, have patientiam with me, and I will pay thee all.''</p>
<p>Then the dominus of that servus was moved with misericordia, and loosed him, and forgave him the debitum.'</p>
<p>But the same servos went out, and found one of his conservos, which owed him centum denarii: and he laid hands on him, and took him by the gula, saying, 'Pay me that thou owest.''</p>
<p>And his conservus fell down at his pedes, and besought him, saying, 'Have patientiam with me, and I will pay thee all.''</p>
<p>And he would not: but went and cast him into carcerem, till he should pay the debitum.'</p>
<p>So when his conservi saw what was done, they were very dolorosi, and came and told their domino all that was done.'</p>
<p>Then his dominus called him, and saith unto him, 'O servus nequam, I forgave thee all that debitum, because thou desiredst me:'</p>
<p>Shouldest not thou also have had misericordia on thy conservus, even as I had misericordia on thee?'</p>
<p>And his dominus was iratus, and delivered him to the tormentores, till he should pay all that was due unto him.'</p>
<p>So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your corda forgive not every one his frater their trespasses.'</p>
