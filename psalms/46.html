                    <p>God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in tribulatio.</p>
<p>Therefore will not we fear, though the terra be removed, and though the montes be carried into the midst of the mari.</p>
<p>Though the aquae thereof roar and be troubled, though the montes shake with the swelling thereof. Selah.</p>
<p>There is a flumen, the streams whereof shall make glad the civitas of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the Most High.</p>
<p>God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her, and that right early.</p>
<p>The heathen raged, the regna were moved: he uttered his vox, the terra melted.</p>
<p>The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.</p>
<p>Come, behold the opera of the Lord, what desolations he hath made in the terra.</p>
<p>He maketh wars to cease unto the finis of the terra; he breaketh the arcum, and cutteth the gladius in sunder; he burneth the carrus with fire.</p>
<p>Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the terra.</p>
<p>The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.</p>
