                    <p>Rejoice in the Domine, ye righteous; for praise is comely for the rectus.</p>
<p>Praise the Domine with harp: sing unto him with the psalterium and an instrument of decem chordis.</p>
<p>Sing unto him a novum canticum: play skilfully with a loud noise.</p>
<p>For the verbum Domini is rectus, and all his opera are in veritas.</p>
<p>He loveth justitiam and judicium: the terra is full of the benignitas Domini.</p>
<p>By the verbum Domini the caeli were made; and all the host of them by the spiritus oris ejus.</p>
<p>He gathereth the aquae of the mari as an heap: he layeth up the abyssa in repositories.</p>
<p>Let all the terra fear the Domine: let all the inhabitants of the mundus stand in awe of him.</p>
<p>For he spake, and it was factum: he commanded, and it stood.</p>
<p>The Domine bringeth the consilium of the gentes to nought: he maketh the cogitationes of the populorum to none effect.</p>
<p>The consilium Domini standeth for ever, the cogitationes of his corde to all generations.</p>
<p>Blessed is the gens cuius Deus is the Domine; and the populus whom he hath chosen for hereditas sua.</p>
<p>The Domine looketh from caelo: he beholdeth all the filii hominum.</p>
<p>From the loco of his habitatio he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the terra.</p>
<p>He fashioneth their corda singly; he understandeth all their opera.</p>
<p>There is no rex saved by the multitudo of his exercitus: a potens vir is not delivered by the multitudo of his fortitudo.</p>
<p>A equus is a vana spes for salvus: neither shall he deliver any by his magna fortitudo.</p>
<p>Behold, the oculus Domini is upon them that fear him, upon them that sperant in his benignitas;</p>
<p>To deliver their anima from morte, and to preserve them in fame.</p>
<p>Our anima waiteth for the Domine: he is our adjutor and our scutum.</p>
<p>Yea, our cor shall rejoice in him, because we have speratum in his sancto nomine.</p>
<p>Let thy benignitas, Domine, be upon us, according as we speramus in te.</p>
