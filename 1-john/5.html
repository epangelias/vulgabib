                    <p>Everyone communitas that hath this world doth confess that Jesus Christ is come in caro, and this is he that came by aqua and sanguine.</p>
<p>He that believeth that Jesus is the Christ is genitus of God: and every one that loveth Him that genitus also loveth Him qui genitus of Him.</p>
<p>By this we know that we love the filii of God, when we love God and keep His mandata.</p>
<p>For this is the caritas of God, that we keep His mandata: and His mandata are not grauia.</p>
<p>For whatsoever is genitus of God overcometh mundum: and this is the victoria that overcometh mundum, even our fides.</p>
<p>Who is he that overcometh mundum, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Filius of God?</p>
<p>This is He that came by aqua and sanguine, even Jesus Christ; not by aqua only, but by aqua and sanguine: and it is the Spirit that beareth testimonium, because the Spirit is veritas.</p>
<p>For there are three that bear record in caelo, the Father, the Verbum, and the Holy Spirit: and these three are unum.</p>
<p>And there are three that bear witness in terra, the Spirit, and the aqua, and the sanguine: and these three agree in unum.</p>
<p>If we receive the testimonium of homines, the testimonium of God is greater: for this is the testimonium of God which He hath testified of His Filius.</p>
<p>He that believeth on the Filius of God hath the testimonium in himself: he that believeth not God hath made Him mendacem; because he believeth not the record that God gave of His Filius.</p>
<p>And this is the record, that God hath given to us aeternam vitam, and this vita is in His Filius.</p>
<p>He that hath the Filius hath vitam; and he that hath not the Filius of God hath not vitam.</p>
<p>These things have I written unto you that believe on the nomine of the Filius of God; that ye may know that ye have aeternam vitam, and that ye may believe on the nomine of the Filius of God.</p>
<p>And this is the fiducia that we have in Him, that, if we petimus any thing according to His voluntas, He heareth us:</p>
<p>And if we know that He hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitiones that we desired of Him.</p>
<p>If any man see his brother peccare a peccato that is not unto mortem, he shall ask, and He shall give him vita for them that sin not unto mortem. There is a sin unto mortem: I do not say that he shall pray for it.</p>
<p>All unrighteousness is peccatum: and there is a peccatum not unto mortem.</p>
<p>We know that whosoever is genitus of God sinneth not; but he that was genitus of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not.</p>
<p>We know that we are of God, and the whole mundum lieth in wickedness.</p>
<p>And we know that the Filius of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know Him that is verus.</p>
<p>And we are in Him that is verus, even in His Filius Jesus Christ. This is the verus God, and aeterna vita.</p>
<p>Little children, keep yourselves from idola. Amen.</p>
