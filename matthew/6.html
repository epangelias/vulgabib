                    <p>Take heed that ye do not your caritas before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Pater which is in heaven.</p>
<p>Beware of practising your pietas before men in order to be seen by them; for then you will have no recompense from your Pater who is in the heavens.</p>
<p>When therefore thou doest thine eleemosyna, sound not a trumpet before thee, as the hypocritae do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</p>
<p>But when thou doest alms, let not thy sinister hand know what thy dexter hand doeth:</p>
<p>That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Pater which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.</p>
<p>And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocritae are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</p>
<p>But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy cubiculum, and when thou hast shut thy ostium, pray to thy Pater which is in secret; and thy Pater which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.</p>
<p>But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the gentes do: for they think that they shall be heard for their multis sermonibus.</p>
<p>Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Pater knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.</p>
<p>After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Pater which art in the heavens, Hallowed be thy nomen.</p>
<p>Thy regnum come, Thy voluntas be done in terra, as it is in caelo:</p>
<p>Give us this day our supersubstantialis panis:</p>
<p>And forgive us our debita, as we forgive our debitoribus:</p>
<p>And lead us not into temptatio, but deliver us from malus:</p>
<p>For thine is the regnum, and the potentia, and the gloria, in saecula, Amen.</p>
<p>For if ye forgive men their peccata, your caelestis Pater will also forgive you:</p>
<p>But if ye forgive not men their peccata, neither will your Pater forgive your peccata.</p>
<p>Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocritae, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</p>
<p>But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine caput, and wash thy facies;</p>
<p>That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Pater which is in secret: and thy Pater, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.</p>
<p>Lay not up for yourselves thesauri upon terra, where moth and ruginem do corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:</p>
<p>But lay up for yourselves thesauri in caelo, where neither moth nor ruginem doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:</p>
<p>For where your thesaurus is, there will your cor be also.</p>
<p>The lucerna of the corpus is the oculus: if therefore thine oculus be simplex, thy whole corpus shall be full of lux.</p>
<p>But if thine oculus be malignant, thy whole corpus shall be full of tenebrae. If therefore the lux that is in thee be tenebrae, how great is that tenebrae!</p>
<p>No man can serve two domini: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve Deus and Mammona.</p>
<p>Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your vita, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your corpus, what ye shall put on. Is not the vita more than meat, and the corpus than raiment?</p>
<p>Behold the aves of the heaven: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your caelestis Pater feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?</p>
<p>Which of you by taking thought can add one cubitus unto his stature?</p>
<p>And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilia of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:</p>
<p>And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his gloria was not arrayed like one of these.</p>
<p>Wherefore, if Deus so clothe the gramina of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the clibanus, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little fides?</p>
<p>Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?</p>
<p>(For after all these things do the gentes seek:) for your caelestis Pater knoweth that ye have need of all these things.</p>
<p>But seek ye first the regnum of Deus, and his justitia; and all these things shall be added unto you.</p>
<p>Take therefore no thought for the cras: for the cras shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficit unto the die its own malum.</p>
