  "But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:",
  "That the aged men be sober, grave, temperant, sound in fide, in charity, in patience.",
  "The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh sanctimonia, not false accusers, not given to much vinum, teachers of boni operis;",
  "That they may teach the young women to be sobria, to love their viri, to love their filii,",
  "To be discreet, chaste, keepers of the domus, bona, obedient to their viri, that the word of Deus be not blasphemed.",
  "Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.",
  "In all things shewing thyself a pattern of boni operis: in doctrine shewing incorruptness, gravitatem, sinceritatem,",
  "Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the adversary may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of thee.",
  "Exhort servants to be obedient unto their domini, and to please them well in all things; not answering again;",
  "Not purloining, but shewing all bona fides; that they may adorn the doctrine of Deus our Salvator in all things."
