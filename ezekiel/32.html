                    <p>Thus saith Dominus Deus; When the house of Israel dwelt in their own terra, they defiled it by their own via, and by the iniquitates of their abominations: therefore I poured out my indignatio upon them.</p>
<p>The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon thee, and I will destroy thy multitude, in the midst of thee.</p>
<p>Thy people shall fall by the sword, and thy pompa shall come down to the infernus.</p>
<p>The sword is without, and pestis and famine within: he that is in the ager shall die by the gladius; and he that is in the urbs, famine and pestis shall devour him.</p>
<p>And they shall know that I am Dominus, when I have scattered them among the gentes, and dispersed them in the terrae.</p>
<p>Because thou hast not remembered the dies of thy iuventus, but hast troubled me in all these things; behold, therefore I have put thy iniquitas before thee, saith Dominus Deus: therefore I will do these abominationes, that thou mayest become odium and ignominia among the gentes.</p>
<p>Thou shalt be a derision and a scorn, a proverb and a fabula among the gentes, that are round about thee, when I shall execute judicia in thee in indignation and in ira, and in fervent correption.</p>
<p>I will do therefore as thou hast done, which hast despised the oath in breaking the foedus.</p>
<p>Neither shall mine ocular have pity, nor will I spare: but I will recompense thy via upon thee, and thy abomination shall be in the midst of thee: and thou shalt know that I am Dominus.</p>
<p>Thus saith Dominus Deus; It shall also come to pass, that at the same hora, when they have slain the filii of Israel, the filii of Babylon shall begin to fall.</p>
<p>And when the gladius hath made an end of killing all the filii of Babylon, I will cause the clamor of the sword to cease against them.</p>
<p>The horsemen shall come from the urbs of Egypt, and they shall cover the terra of Egypt, and the terra shall be full of the equites: for I will put the timor of me upon the gentes, saith Dominus Deus.</p>
<p>Thus saith Dominus Deus; I will also destroy the idola, and I will cause their imagines to cease out of Noph; and there shall be no more a prince of the terra of Egypt: and I will put a timor in the terra of Egypt.</p>
<p>And I will make Pathros desolate, and will set a ignis in Zoan, and will execute judicia in No.</p>
<p>And I will pour out my indignation upon Sin, the stronghold of Egypt; and I will cut off the multitude of No.</p>
<p>Sin shall be in great afflictio, as the afflictio of Egypt, and No shall be broken up, and Noph shall have distresses daily.</p>
<p>The young men of Aven and of Pibeseth shall fall by the gladius: and these urbes shall go into captivitas.</p>
<p>At the same hora shall they cover the terra of Egypt, and the terra shall be full of the equites; for I will put the timor of me upon the gentes, saith Dominus Deus.</p>
<p>I will put a ignis in Egypt: Sin shall have great afflictio, and No shall be rent asunder, and Noph shall have distresses daily.</p>
<p>The young men of Aven and of Pibeseth shall fall by the gladius: and these urbes shall go into captivitas.</p>
<p>At the same hora shall the daughters of Egypt be troubled, and they shall be led away, and shall be brought up, as virgins taken by force.</p>
<p>Thus saith Dominus Deus; I will also destroy the confidentiam of Egypt, and they shall cease out of the terra of Egypt: and I will destroy the multitude of No.</p>
<p>And I will set a ignis in Egypt; Sin shall have great afflictio, and No shall be rent asunder, and Noph shall have distresses daily.</p>
<p>Her young men shall fall in the urbes of Egypt, and all the men of war shall be cut off in that die, saith Dominus Deus.</p>
<p>Thus saith Dominus Deus; Lo, I will bring again the captivitas of Egypt, and will bring again the multitude of Egypt, and will cause them to return into the terra of Pathros, into the terra of their nativitas; and they shall be there a modicus people.</p>
<p>And they shall be no more the confidentiam of the domus of Israel, but will bring their iniquitas to remembrance, when they shall look after them: then shall they know that I am Dominus Deus.</p>
