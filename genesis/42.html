                    <p>And Israel said, It is enough; my son Joseph is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die, and Jacob sent messengers and called for Joseph, and he came with his carrus, and apparuit before him, and he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.</p>
<p>And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me mori, since I have seen thy facies, and thou art yet vivus.</p>
<p>And Joseph took his filii, and his filias, and shewed them to his pater, and Israel said, Who are these?</p>
<p>And Joseph said unto his pater, They are my filii, whom Deus hath given me in this loco. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will benedicere them.</p>
<p>Now the oculi of Israel were dim for senectus, so that he could not videre. And he caused them to approximare unto him; and he kissed them, and ammonuit them.</p>
<p>And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not speravi to see thy facies: and, lo, Deus hath shewed me also thy semen.</p>
<p>And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his dexter manu toward Israel's sinister manu, and Manasseh in his sinister manu toward Israel's dexter manu, and brought them near unto him.</p>
<p>And Israel stretched out his dexter manu, and laid it upon Ephraim's caput, who was the junior, and his sinister manu upon Manasseh's caput, guiding his manus wittingly; for Manasseh was the primogenitus.</p>
<p>And he benedixit them, and said, In thee shall Israel benedicere, saying, Deus faciat te sicut Ephraim, et sicut Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.</p>
<p>And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but Deus shall be with you, and reducere you unto the terra of your patres.</p>
<p>Moreover I have given to thee one portio above thy fratres, which I took out of the manu of the Amorite with my gladius and with my arcus.</p>
<p>And Jacob lived in the terra of Aegyptum seventeen anni: so the whole age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven anni.</p>
<p>And the days of Israel drew nigh that he must mori: and he called his filius Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found gratiam in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy manus under my femur, and deal with me in misericordia and veritas: bury me not, I pray thee, in Aegyptum:</p>
<p>So Joseph made a promissio unto him, and sware unto him. And Israel bowed himself upon the caput of the lectus.</p>
