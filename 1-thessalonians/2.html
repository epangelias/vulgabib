                    <p>For veritas (truth) sake, a tabernacula (tabernacle) of God is with homines (men), and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his populus (people), and God himself shall be with them, and be their Deus (God).</p>
<p>We were gentle among you, even as a nutrix (nurse) cherisheth her filii (children):</p>
<p>So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the logos (word) of God only, but also our own animae (souls), because ye were dear unto us.</p>
<p>For ye remember, brethren, our labour and toil: working night and diem (day), because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the evangelium (gospel) of God.</p>
<p>Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe:</p>
<p>As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every unus (one) of you, as a pater (father) doth his filii (children),</p>
<p>That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his regnum (kingdom) and gloria (glory).</p>
<p>For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the logos (word) of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the logos (word) of homines (men), but as it is in truth, the logos (word) of God, which effectually worketh in you that believe.</p>
