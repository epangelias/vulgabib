  "And it came to pass, that after the year was expired, at the time that kings go out to battle, Joab led forth the power of the exercitus, and wasted the terram of the filii Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Hierosolyma. And Joab smote Rabbah, and destroyed it.",
  "And David took the corona of their rex from off his capite, whose weight was a talent of auri, with precious lapides, and it was set on David's capite. And he brought forth the spolia of the civitas in great abundance.",
  "And he brought forth the populus that was in it, and put them under the tribulum, and under the trahas, and under the ferrum, and made them pass through the fornacem. Thus did he to all the civitates of the filii Ammon. And David and all the populus returned to Hierosolyma.",
  "And it came to pass after this, that there arose a pugna at Gezer with the Philisthim; at which time Sibbechai the Husathites slew Sippai, of the filii Rapha, and they were humbled.",
  "And there was also pugna with the Philisthim; and Elhanan the filius of Jair slew Lahmi the fratres of Goliath the Gittite, whose hastile was like a torno.",
  "And there was yet another pugna in Gath, where was a vir of great stature, whose digiti and pedes were four and viginti, also six.",
  "And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the filius of Samaa the fratres of David slew him.",
  "These were filii of Rapha in Gath, who fell by the manus of David, and by the manus of his servus."
