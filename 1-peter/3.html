                    <p>Likewise, ye wives, be in submissio to your husbands; that, if any obey not the verbum of God, they also may without the verbum be won by the conversation of the wives;</p>
<p>While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear.</p>
<p>Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of jewels of gold, or of putting on of apparel;</p>
<p>But let it be the hidden homo of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of Deus very precious.</p>
<p>For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in Deus, adorned themselves, being in submissio unto their own husbands:</p>
<p>Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him dominus: whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any terror.</p>
<p>Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to scientia, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the gratia of life; that your prayers be not hindered.</p>
<p>Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous:</p>
<p>Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit benedictio.</p>
<p>For he that will love vita, and see dies, let him eschew malum, and do bonum; let him seek pacem, and ensue it.</p>
<p>For the eyes of the Dominus are over the just, and his aures are open unto their prayers: but the facies of the Dominus is against them that do malum.</p>
