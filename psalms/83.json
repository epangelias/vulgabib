  "1 O God, do not keep silence: hold not thy peace, and be not still, Deus meus, ne taceas.",
  "2 For, behold, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have magnificus, lifted up their head.",
  "3 They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones.",
  "4 They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a gens: that the name of Israel may be no more in memoria.",
  "5 For they have consulted together with one consent: they are in foedus against thee:",
  "6 The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarenes;",
  "7 Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre;",
  "8 Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children of Lot. Selah.",
  "9 Do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook of Kison:",
  "10 Which perished at En-dor: they became as dung for the terra.",
  "11 Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna:",
  "12 Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of Deus in hereditas.",
  "13 O my Deus, make them like aè½®: like the stubble before the facies.",
  "14 As the flamma burneth a forest, and as the ignis setteth the mountains on smoke;",
  "15 So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy procella.",
  "16 Fill their facies with confusion: that they may seek thy nomine, O Deus.",
  "17 Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish:",
  "18 That men may know that thou, whose nomine alone is Jehova, art the Altissimus over all the terra."
