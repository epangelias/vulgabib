                    <p>And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the sigillum Dei vivi, and he cried with a loud vox, saying to the four angeli, 'Quos Deus commisit in quartuor partes terrae, hurt not the terra, neither the mare, neither the arbor, till we have sealed the servi of our Deus in their frontes.'</p>
<p>And I heard the numerus of them which were sealed: and there were sealed an hundred and forty-four milia of all the tribus of the filii Israel.</p>
<p>Of the tribus of Juda were sealed twelve milia. Of the tribus of Reuben were sealed twelve milia. Of the tribus of Gad were sealed twelve milia.</p>
<p>Of the tribus of Aser were sealed twelve milia. Of the tribus of Nephthalim were sealed twelve milia. Of the tribus of Manasses were sealed twelve milia.</p>
<p>Of the tribus of Simeon were sealed twelve milia. Of the tribus of Levi were sealed twelve milia. Of the tribus of Issachar were sealed twelve milia.</p>
<p>Of the tribus of Zabulon were sealed twelve milia. Of the tribus of Joseph were sealed twelve milia. Of the tribus of Benjamin were sealed twelve milia.</p>
<p>And after these things I saw a great multitude, quos nemo poterat dinumerare, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and linguae, standing before the throne, and before the Agnus, clothed with white vestes, and palms in their manus;</p>
<p>These are they which came out of great tribulatio, and have washed their vestes, and made them white in the sanguine Agni.</p>
<p>Therefore are they before the throne of Deus, and serve him day and nocte in his templum: and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them.</p>
<p>They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sol scorch them, nor any heat;</p>
<p>For the Agnus which is in the midst of the throne shall govern them, and shall lead them unto vivae fontes aquarum: and Deus shall wipe away all lacrimae from their oculis.</p>
