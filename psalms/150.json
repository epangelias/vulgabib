  "Hallelujah, laus Deo meo, qui dat mihi gaudium et lætitiam. Praise God in his sanctuary: praise him in the firmament of his power.",
  "Praise him for his mighty acts: praise him according to his excellent greatness. Laudate eum in sono tubæ: laudate eum in psalterio, et cithara.",
  "Praise him with the timbrel and dance: praise him with stringed instruments and organs. Laudate eum in tympano, et choro: laudate eum in chordis, et organo.",
  "Praise him upon the loud cymbals: praise him upon the high sounding cymbals. Laudate eum in cymbalis bene sonantibus: laudate eum in cymbalis jubilationis.",
  "Let every thing that hath spirit, laus Deo meo, praise the Lord. Omnis spiritus laudet Dominum."
