  "The LORD also spake unto Joshua, saying, 2 Speak to the children of Israel, saying, Appoint out for you cities of refugium, of which I spake unto you by the hand of Moses:",
  "3 That the slayer that killeth any person unvoluntarily and ignorans may flee thither: and they shall be your refugium from the avenger of sanguis.",
  "4 And when he that is fugiens unto one of those cities shall stand at the porta of the city, and shall speak unto the anciani of that city such things as they shall testify unto him; and they shall receive him unto one of their cities, and give him a locus to dwell in.",
  "5 And if the avenger of sanguis pursue him, then they shall not deliver the fugiens up into his manus, because he smote his proximus ignorans, and hated him not beforetime.",
  "6 And he shall dwell in that city, until he stand before the congregation for judicium, and until the mors of the high sacerdos that shall be in those dies: then shall the slayer return, and come unto his own city, and unto his own domus, unto the city from whence he fled.",
  "7 And they appointed Kedesh in Galilaea in monte Nepthali, and Shechem in monte Ephraim, and Kirjath-arba, which is Hebron, in the monte of Judah.",
  "8 And on the other side Jordan toward Jericho eastward, they assigned Bezer in the wilderness upon the plateau of the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Basan out of the tribe of Manasseh.",
  "9 These were the cities appointed for all the children of Israel, and for the peregrinus that sojourneth among them, that whosoever killeth any person ignorans, the murderer might flee thither, and not die by the manus of the avenger of sanguis, until he stood before the congregation."
