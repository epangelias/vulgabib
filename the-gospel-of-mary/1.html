                    <p>The gospel according to Mary Magdalene, caput I.</p>
<p>And the Lord said, whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God?</p>
<p>It is like a granum sinapis, which, when it is sown in terra, is lesser than all seeds that be in terra:</p>
<p>But when it is sown, ascendit, and fit maior omnibus plantationibus, and maken a great ramus, so that the aves coeli can dwell under the umbra eius.</p>
<p>And with many such parabolis spake he the word unto them, as they were able to capere.</p>
<p>And without parabolis did not speak to them, according to that which was scriptum, oculus non vidit, nec auris audivit, nec in cor hominis ascendit, quea praeparavit Deus iis qui diligunt illum.</p>
<p>But when he was alone, the twelve interrogabant eum of the parabolis.</p>
<p>And he said unto them, unto you it is dato to know the mysterium regni Dei, but to them that are outside, in parabolis omnia fiunt:</p>
<p>that seeing they may see, and not videant, and hearing they may hear, and not audiant, ne forte convertantur, et dimittantur eis peccata.</p>
<p>And he said, know you not this parabolim? and how shall you understand omnes parabolas?</p>
<p>If ye know not this parabolim, how shall ye understand all things that are scripta?</p>
<p>And no man putteth vinum novum in utres veteres, ne forte utres scindantur, et vinum stillat, et utres perit.</p>
<p>sed vinum novum in utres novos, and both are saved.</p>
