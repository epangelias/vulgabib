                    <p>This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.</p>
<p>This is a true saying, If a man desire the officium of a bishop, he desireth a bonum opus.</p>
<p>A bishop then must be blamless, as a steward of Deus, not self-willed, not soon angry, not given to vinum, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre;</p>
<p>But a bishop then must be irreprehensibilis, as a dispensator of Deus, not self-willed, not pronto irascibilis, not deditus to vinum, no striker, not cupidus of filthy lucre;</p>
<p>One that ruleth well his own domus, having his filii in subjection with all gravitas;</p>
<p>(For if a man know not how to rule his own domus, how shall he take care of the Ecclesia of Deus?);</p>
<p>A bishop must not be a neophyte, lest being lifted up with superbia he fall into the damnation of the diabolus;</p>
<p>Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the diabolus.</p>
<p>Likewise must the deaconi be gravitas, not double-tongued, not given to much vinum, not greedy of filthy lucre;</p>
<p>Holding the mysterium of the fides in a pure conscience.</p>
<p>And let these also first be proved; then let them use the officium of a deacon, being found blameless.</p>
<p>Even so must their uxores be gravitas, not slanderers, sober, fideles in all things.</p>
<p>Let the deaconi be the husbands of one uxor, ruling their filii and their own domus well.</p>
<p>For they that have used the officium of a deacon well purchase to themselves a bonum gradum, and much fiduciam in the fides which is in Christum Jesum.</p>
