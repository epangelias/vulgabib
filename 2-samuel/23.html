                    <p>Now these be the last words of David. David the son of Jesse said, and the man who was exaltatus above the sons of Israel, the electus of the Deus of Jacob, the dulcis psalmista of Israel, said,</p>
<p>The Spiritus of the Deus spake by me, and his word was in my lingua.</p>
<p>The Deus of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that ruleth over homines must be justus, ruling in the timor of Deus.</p>
<p>And he shall be as the lucem of the morning, when the sol rises, even a morning without nebula, as the terra by the raines of the herba, out of the terra without nebula.</p>
<p>For who is my domus, that I should spare him? and who is he that shall vivere, that I shall not reservare him? for there is no numerus of anni in his vita.</p>
<p>He shall be as the herba before the facies of the ventus, and as the herba that growth before the sol.</p>
<p>For though his radix be sicut the radix of the montes, and though his radix be sicut the radix of the valles, yet shall he be sicut the herba that growth before the sol.</p>
<p>And now, behold, I go the via of omnium terrae: be thou fortis therefore, and be thou virilis.</p>
<p>And thou shalt do according to all that is in corde tuo, and in all wherein thou art instructus, and be thou fortemens.</p>
<p>Fear not, for I am with thee, I am Deus, I will strengthen thee, yea, I will help thee, yea, I will uphold thee with the dextera of my iustitia.</p>
<p>Behold, God is my salvator; I will trust, and not be afraid: for the Domine Deus is my fortitudo and my canticum; he also is become my salvator.</p>
<p>And he said, The Domine is my petra, and my fortitudo, and he is become my salvator.</p>
<p>The Deus of my patres, in whom I trust, and who hath delivered me from the odium of my inimicus, and who exaltavit me above mine inimici, and who hath delivered me from the viri violenti.</p>
<p>Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O Domine, among the gentes, and I will sing praises unto thy nomine.</p>
<p>He is the turris of salvus to his rege, and sheweth misericordia to his christus, to David, and to his semen, for evermore.</p>
<p>These be the nomina of the valentes whom David had: Ioseph the Tachmonite, he was the prince of the principes; the same was Adino the Eznite, who fought against eight hundred, whom he slew at one tempus.</p>
<p>And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the three valentes.</p>
<p>He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philisthim were gathered together to the pugna, where was a parcel of terra full of segetes; and the populus fled from the Philisthim.</p>
<p>And they set themselves in the midst of that parcel, and delivered it, and slew the Philisthim; and the Domine saved them by a great salvus.</p>
<p>And the nomina of the three valentes of the thirty; and their nomina were not numerati among the first three.</p>
<p>And Abisai the brother of Ioab, he was the prince of the thirty; and he lifted up his lance against three hundred, whom he slew, and had the nomine among three.</p>
<p>Was he not most honorabilis of three? therefore he was their prince: howbeit he attained not to the first three.</p>
<p>And Benaiah the son of Iehoiada, the son of a vir valens of great opera, of Cabseel, who had done many acta: he slew two leones of Moab, and he went down and slew a leon in the midst of a cisterna in the die of the nive.</p>
<p>And he slew an Aegyptius, a vir of great stature, five cubitos high; and in the manus of the Aegyptius was a lance like a vectis of texentes; and he went down to him with a virga, and plucked the lance out of the manus of the Aegyptius, and slew him with his own lance.</p>
<p>These things did Benaiah the son of Iehoiada, and had the nomine among three valentes.</p>
<p>He was more honorabilis than the thirty, but he attained not to the first three: and David set him over his guardia.</p>
<p>Also the valentes of the exercitus were Asahel the brother of Ioab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,</p>
<p>Sama and Ielah the filii of Hothan the Harodite,</p>
<p>Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,</p>
<p>Abiezer the Anathothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite,</p>
<p>Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,</p>
<p>Heleb the son of Baanah, a Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai out of Gibeah of the filii of Benjamin,</p>
<p>Benaiah the Pirathonite, Hiddai of the rivulis of Gaash,</p>
<p>Abialbon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,</p>
<p>Eliahba the Saalbonite, of the filii of Iassen, Ionathan,</p>
<p>Sama the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sarar the Ararite,</p>
<p>Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maachathite, Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,</p>
<p>Hezrai the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,</p>
<p>Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite,</p>
<p>Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, armourbearer to Ioab the son of Zeruiah,</p>
<p>Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,</p>
<p>Uriah the Hittite: thirty and seven in all.</p>
