                    <p>And as he went out of the templum, one of his discipuli saith unto him, Magister, vide, quae magna lapides et quae aedificia.</p>
<p>And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great aedificia? there shall not be left here one lapidem upon another, that shall not be dissolutus.</p>
<p>And as he sat upon the montem Olivarum over against the templum, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately, Magister, when shall these things be? and what shall be the signum when all these things shall be fulfilled?</p>
<p>And Jesus answering them began to say, Take heed lest any man deceivat you:</p>
<p>For many shall come in nomine meo, saying, I am Christus; and shall deceivat many.</p>
<p>And when ye shall hear of bella and rumors of bella, be ye not terrifie; for such things must be; but the finis is not yet.</p>
<p>For nation shall rise against nation, and regnum against regnum: and there shall be terraemotus in diversis locis, and famines and troubles: these are the beginnings of dolores.</p>
<p>But take heed to your selves: for they shall deliver you up to conciliis, and in synagogis ye shall be beaten: and ye shall be brought before praesides and regetes for my nomine sake.</p>
<p>But it shall turn to testimonium for you.</p>
<p>And the Evangelium must first be preached among omnes gentes.</p>
<p>But when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak, ne cogitaveritis; but whatsoever shall be given you in that hora, that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Spiritus Sanctus.</p>
<p>Now the frater shall betray the fratrem to mors, and the pater the filium; and the filii shall rise up against parentes, and shall put them to mors.</p>
<p>And ye shall be hated of omnes homines propter nomen meum: but he that perseveraverit to the finis, hic salvus erit.</p>
<p>And when ye shall see the abominatio desolationis, spoken of by Daniel propheta, standing where it ought not, (let him that readeth understand,) then let them that be in Iudaea flee to montes:</p>
<p>And let him that is on the tectum not go down into the domus, neither enter therein, to take any thing out of the domus:</p>
<p>And let him that is in agro not turn back again for to take up his vestimentum.</p>
<p>But woe to them that are in utero, and to them that lactant in those diebus.</p>
<p>And pray ye that your fugia may not be in hieme.</p>
<p>For in those diebus shall be such tribulatio, qualis non fuit ab initio creaturae, quam creavit Deus, usque ad nunc, neque fiet.</p>
<p>And except Dominus breviasset dies illos, non esset salva omnis caro: sed propter electos, quos elegit, breviavit dies illos.</p>
<p>And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christus; or, lo, he is there; believe not:</p>
<p>For false Christi and false prophetae shall rise, and shall shew signa and prodigia, to seducere, if it were possible, etiam electos.</p>
<p>But take ye heed: behold, I have praedixit you all things.</p>
<p>But in those diebus, after illam tribulationem, sol obscurabitur, et luna non dabit lumen suum,</p>
<p>And the stellae of caelum shall be falling, and the virtutes, quae sunt in caelis, shall be shaken.</p>
<p>And then shall they see the Filium hominis venientem in nubibus cum potestate magna et gloria.</p>
<p>And then shall he send his angelos, and shall gather together his electos from quattuor ventis, from finibus terrae, usque ad finem caeli.</p>
<p>Now learn a parabolam of the ficus arbor: when her ramus est tener, and putteth forth folia, you know that aestas is near:</p>
<p>So ye in like manner, when ye shall see these things come to pass, know that it is nigh, even at the ostia.</p>
<p>Verily I say unto you, that this generatio shall not pass, till all these things be done.</p>
<p>Caelum and terra transibunt, but my verba shall not transire.</p>
<p>But of that die, or hora, no man scit, neque angeli in caelo, neque Filius, nisi Pater.</p>
<p>Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the temporis is.</p>
<p>For the Filium hominis is as a paterfamilias, who is gone in viam, and hath left domus sua servos, and hath given them potestatem, and to every man his opus, and commandavit janitor, that he should vigilare.</p>
<p>Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the paterfamilias of the domus cometh, at vespere, or at media nocte, or at galli cantu, or in mane:</p>
<p>Lest coming he find you dormientes.</p>
<p>And what I say unto you I say unto omnes, Vigilate.</p>
