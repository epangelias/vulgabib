                    <p>Woe to her that is tumultuosa, and polluted, the oppidum of violenter.</p>
<p>She obeyed not the vox of the Dominus, she received not disciplina, she trusted not in the Dominus, her progreditio drew not near to her Deus.</p>
<p>Her iudices are leones, rapiendo in evening, and they leave nothing for the mane.</p>
<p>Her prophetae are impudent, viri suntSimulation, they have dealt deceitfully with the Deus, prophesying visiones falsae, and divinationes mendacia, that they might lead my populus Israel into error.</p>
<p>But the Dominus is iustus, he hath done iustitia, every morning he showeth his iudicium, he faileth not, but the iniquus knoweth no confusio.</p>
<p>I have destroyed gentes, their turres are destroyed, I made their vias solitarias, that none passeth by, their civitates are destroyed, so that there is no homo, no inhabitant.</p>
<p>I said, surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive disciplina, and her habitatio shall not be destroyed, according to all that I have appointed for her, but they rose early, and corrupted all their opera.</p>
<p>Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the Dominus, until the dies when I rise up to the praedatio, for my iudicium is to gather gentes, that I may assemble regna, to pour upon them my indignatio, even all my ira, for all the terra shall be devoured with the ignis of my zelus.</p>
<p>For then will I turn to populis a lingua pura, that they may all invoke the nomen of the Dominus, to serve Him with one shoulder.</p>
<p>From beyond the flumen Aethiopia my supplicantes, the filiae my dispersae, shall bring me oblationem.</p>
<p>In that dies shalt thou not be confundus for all thy opera, wherein thou hast transgressed against me, for then I will take away out of the medio of thee them that rejoice in thy superbia, and thou shalt no more be proud of the montes my sanctus.</p>
<p>I will leave in the medio of thee an afflicted and poor populus, and they shall trust in the nomen of the Dominus.</p>
<p>The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquitatem, nor speak mendacium, neither shall a lingua fallacia be found in their os, for they shall be fed, and lie down, and none shall make them afraid.</p>
<p>Sing, O filia of Sion, shout, O Israel, be glad and rejoice with all the cor, O filia of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The Dominus hath taken away thy iudiciums, he hath cast out thine inimicus, the Rex of Israel, even the Dominus, is in the medio of thee, thou shalt not see evil any more.</p>
<p>In that dies it shall be said to Ierusalem, Fear thou not, O Sion, let not thy manus be faint.</p>
<p>The Dominus thy Deus in the medio of thee is potent, he will save, he will rejoice over thee with gaudium, he will make silent in his amor, he will joy over thee with canticum.</p>
<p>Behold, I will gather her that are dispersed, and her that I have afflicted.</p>
<p>And I will make her that was lamed to be preserved, and her that was cast far off to be a strong civitas, and the Dominus shall reign over them in the montes of Sion from that dies and for ever.</p>
