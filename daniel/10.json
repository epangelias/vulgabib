  "In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed unto Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing was true, but the time appointed was long: and he understood the thing, and had intelligencia in the vision.",
  "In those days I Daniel was mourning three weeks, with a tristitia of my countenance; I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled.",
  "And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which is Hiddekel;",
  "Then I lifted up mine oculus, and looked, and behold a certain man clothed in linen, whose lumbus was girt with fine gold of Uphaz:",
  "His body also was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his oculi as lamps of ignis, and his brachia and his pedes like in colore polished aereum, and the vox of his verba like the vox of a multitudo.",
  "And I Daniel alone saw the vision: for the homines that were with me saw not the vision; but a tremendous tremor fell upon them, so that they fled to hide themselves.",
  "Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no fortitudo in me: for my vigor was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no robur.",
  "Yet heard I the vox of his verba: and when I heard the vox of his verba, then was I in a sopor, and my facies pressed to the terra.",
  "And, behold, a manus touched me, which set me upon my genua and the palma of my manus.",
  "And he said unto me, O Daniel, vir desideriorum, understand the verba that I speak unto thee, and stand upright: for unto thee am I now sent. And when he had spoken this verbum unto me, I stood trembling.",
  "Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first die that thou didst set thy cor to understand, and to afflict thyself before thy Deus, thy verba were heard, and I am come for thy verba.",
  "But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty dies: and, lo, Michael, one of the principes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia.",
  "Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy populus in the latter dies: for yet the vision is for many dies.",
  "And when he had spoken such verba unto me, I set my facies toward the terra, and I became mute.",
  "Then, behold, a manus touched my os, and set me upon my genua and the palma of my manus.",
  "And he said unto me, O Daniel, servus Dei, understand the verba that I speak unto thee, and hear in thy cor: for now I am sent unto thee. And while he spoke this verbum unto me, I stood trembling.",
  "Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for thou art a vir desideriorum: therefore understand the verba, and understand, and hearken to the intellegentia of the verba that I speak unto thee.",
  "And when he had spoken this verbum unto me, I said, Ah, Dominus meus, because of the vision my reins are turned in me, and I retain no robur.",
  "For how can the servus of this my Dominus talk with this my Dominus? for as for me, straightway there remained no robur in me, neither was there breath left in me.",
  "Then again one like the similitudo of the filii of homines touched me, and strengthened me,"
