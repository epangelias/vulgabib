  "1 Help, Domine, for the pii are taken away; for the veritas is diminished from the filii of men.",
  "2 They speak vanitas every one with his proximus; they speak with lingua dolosa.",
  "3 Domine shall cut off all labia that speak magniloquentia, the lingua that speaketh magnificently of itself.",
  "4 Who have said, With our lingua we will prevail; our labia are our own: who is Dominus over us?",
  "5 For the affliction of the pauper, for the sighing of the inops, now will I arise, saith Domine; I will set him in salvus from him that puffeth at him.",
  "6 The verba of Domine are verba pura; argentum igne examinatum, purgatum septuplum.",
  "7 Thou shalt keep them, Domine, thou shalt preservare them from this generatio in aeternum.",
  "8 The impii walk on every side, when vilitas is exalted among the filii of men."
