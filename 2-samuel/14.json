  "Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart was toward Absalom.",
  "And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on now mourning apparel, and anoint not thyself with oleum, but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead:",
  "And come to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So Joab put the words in the mouth of the woman, and she spake all these verba to David the king.",
  "And the woman of Tekoah spake unto the king, and said, Upon me, rex, upon me be the iniquity: and upon my domus, but let the king and his throne be guiltless.",
  "And the king said, Whosoever saith ought unto thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more.",
  "Then said she, I pray thee, rex, remember the Lord thy Deus, that thou wouldest not suffer the exterminators of blood to destroy any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, As the Lord liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the terra.",
  "And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of God? for the king doth speak this thing as one which is faulty, in that the king doth not fetch home again his exul.",
  "For we must needs die, and are as aqua spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth Deus respect any person: yet doth he devise means, that his exul be not expelled from him.",
  "Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my domine the king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and thy handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will perform the word of his handmaid.",
  "For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the hereditas of God.",
  "Then thy handmaid said, The word of my domine the king shall now be comfortable: for as an angel of God, so is my domine the king to discern good and bad: therefore the Lord thy Deus will be with thee.",
  "Then the king said, And where is he? And the woman of Tekoah said, He is in the domus of the Lord, and hath eaten the panis of the oblation, saying, Let Absalom be put to death.",
  "Now therefore, rex, that thou hast sworn by the Lord thy Deus, saying, Assurgo shall surely die for this thing:",
  "Why then hast thou not required of the hand of the Lord thy Deus to fetch home again his exul?",
  "And now, rex, I beseech thee, let not this thing be charged against me, nor remember thou this iniquity against the handmaid, nor against the domus of thy servant Joab, for thy servant Joab himself bade me, and put all these verba in the mouth of thine handmaid:",
  "In this manner then hath thy servant Joab done this thing, and the king is wise, according to the sapientia of an angel of God, to know all things that are in terra.",
  "And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom again.",
  "And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and thanked the king: and Joab said, To day thy servant knoweth that I have found gratiam in thy sight, rex, in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant.",
  "So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.",
  "And the king said, Let him turn to his own domus, and let him not see my facies. So Absalom returned to his own domus, and saw not the facies of the king.",
  "Now in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his forma: from the planta of his pedes even to the cilia of his caput there was no blemish in him.",
  "And when he polled his caput, (for it was at every year's end that he polled it: because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he polled it:) he weighed the hair of his caput at two hundred shekels after the king's pound.",
  "And unto Absalom there were born three filii, and one filia, whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair forma.",
  "So Absalom dwelt two anni in Jerusalem, and saw not the facies of the king.",
  "Then Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king; but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the secundo time, he would not come.",
  "Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab's parcel of terra is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on ignis. And Absalom's servants set the parcel of terra on ignis.",
  "Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his domus, and said unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my parcel of terra on ignis?",
  "And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur? it had been good for me to have been there still: now therefore let me see the facies of the king; and if there be in me iniquity, let him kill me.",
  "So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his facies to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom."
