  "In the third anno of his regnum, he made a feast unto all his principes and his ministri; the power of Persia and Media, the nobiliores and the principes of the provinciae, being before him:",

  "And they gave them drink in vessels of gold, the vessels being diverse one from another; and royal wine in abundance, according to the state of the rex.",
  "And the drinking was according to the law; none did compel: for so the rex had appointed unto all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man's pleasure.",
  "Also Vashti the regina made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to rex Ahasuerus.",
  "On the seventh dies, when the rex was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of the rex Ahasuerus,"
