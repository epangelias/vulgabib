  "And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein Solomon had built the domus of the Lord, and his own domus,",
  "That the cities which Huram had restored to Solomon, Solomon built them, and caused the filii Israel to dwell there.",
  "And Solomon went to Hamathzobah, and prevailed against it.",
  "And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store cities, which he built in Hamath.",
  "Also he built Bethhoron the upper, and Bethhoron the nether, fenced cities, with walls, gates, and bars;",
  "And Baalath, and all the store cities that Solomon had, and all the chariot cities, and the cities of the equites, and all that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and throughout all the land of his dominion.",
  "As for all the populus that were left of the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which were not of the filii Israel,",
  "Their filii that were left after them in the terra, whom the filii Israel also were not able utterly to destroy, upon those did Solomon lay a tributum of servitude unto this day.",
  "But of the filii Israel did Solomon make no servos: but they were homines of war, and his servientes, and his principes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots, and his equites.",
  "These were the principes of Solomon, even two hundred and fifty, that bare rule over the populus.",
  "And Solomon brought up the filia of Pharaoh out of the urbs of David unto the domus that he had built for her: for he said, My uxor shall not dwell in the domus of David rex Israel, because the places are sanctus, whereunto the arca of the Lord hath come.",
  "Then Solomon offered burnt oblations unto the Lord on the altar of the Lord, which he had built before the porticus,",
  "Even after a certain rate every dies, offering according to the commandment of Moses, on the sabbati, and on the new luna, and on the solemn festi.",
  "And he appointed, according to the ordinatio of David his pater, the courses of the sacerdotes to their ministerium, and the Levites to their charges, to praise and minister before the sacerdotes, as the diem required, and the porters by their courses at every porta: for so had David the homo Dei commanded.",
  "And they departed not from the commandment of the rex, concerning the sacerdotes and Levites, and concerning any mater, or concerning the thesauri.",
  "Now all the opus of Solomon was prepared unto the diem of the foundation of the domus of the Lord, and until it was finished. So the domus of the Lord was perfected.",
  "Then went Solomon to Eziongeber, and to Eloth, at the sea side in the terra of Edom.",
  "And Huram sent him by the manÅ«s of his servientes ships, and servientes that had knowledge of the mari, to work with the servientes of Solomon, and they brought great riches unto rex Solomon."
