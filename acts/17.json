  "Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the citadel, quia (because) his spirit was stirred in him, seeing the city wholly given to idolatria (idolatry).",
  "Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Iudaeis (Jews), and with them that worshipped, and in the market daily with them that he met.",
  "Then certain philosophers of the Epicurei (Epicureans), and of the Stoici (Stoics), encountered him. And some said, What will this sutor (sower) of dogmata (doctrines) say? others, He seemeth to be a proclaimer of novi (new) daemonia (demons): because he preached unto them Iesum (Jesus), and the resurrectio (resurrection).",
  "And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we know what this nova (new) doctrina (doctrine) is, whereof thou speakest?",
  "For thou bringest certain novitates (novelties) unto our aures (ears): we would know therefore what these things mean.",
  "For all the Athenienses (Athenians), and strangers which were there, spent their tempus (time) in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some nova (new) res (thing).",
  "Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars' hill, and said, Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitiosi (superstitious).",
  "For as I passed by, and beheld your simulacra (idols), I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN DEUS (GOD). Whom therefore ye ignorantly colitis (worship), him declare I unto you.",
  "Deus (God) that made the mundus (world) and all things therein, seeing that he is Dominus (Lord) of caelum (heaven) and terra (earth), dwelleth not in templis (temples) made with manus (hands):",
  "Neither is worshipped with manus (hands), as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all vita (life), and spiritus (spirit), and respirationem (breath), and all things;",
  "And hath made of one sanguis (blood) all gentes (nations) of homines (men) for to dwell on all the facies (face) of the terra (earth), and hath determinate tempora (times) before appointed, and the limites (limits) of their habitatio (habitation);",
  "That they should seek Deus (God), if haply they might feel him, and find him, though he be not far from every unus (one) of us:",
  "For in him we vivimus (live), and movemur (move), and sumus (are); as certain also of your poetarum (poets) have said, For we are also his genus (kind).",
  "Being therefore the genus (kind) of Deus (God), we ought not to think that the Divinitas (Divinity) is like unto auro (gold), or argentum (silver), or lapide (stone), graven by art and humanus (human) imaginatio (imagination).",
  "And the tempora (times) of this ignorantia (ignorance) Deus (God) winked at; but now commandeth all homines (men) every where to paenitentiam agere (do penance):",
  "Because he hath appointed a dies (day), in the which he will iudicare (judge) the orbis terrarum (world) in iustitia (justice) by that vir (man) whom he hath ordinavit (ordained); whereof he hath given fidem (faith) unto all homines (men), in that he raised him a morte (death).",
  "And when they heard of the resurrectio (resurrection) of the mortui (dead), some mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again of this res (thing).",
  "So Paul went out from among them.",
  "Howbeit certain homines (men) clave unto him, and believed: among the which was Dionysius the Areopagita, and a mulier (woman) named Damaris, and others with them."
