  "1 The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying, 2 Arise, and go down to the potter's house, and there I will cause thee to hear my verbum.",
  "3 Then I went down to the potter's house, and, behold, he wrought a work on the tornus.",
  "4 And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the manus of the potter: so he made it again another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make it.",
  "5 Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying, 6 O house of Israel, cannot I do with you as this potter? saith the Lord. Behold, as the clay is in the potter's manus, so are ye in mine manus, O house of Israel.",
  "7 At what instant I shall speak concerning a gens, and concerning a regnum, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy it;",
  "8 If that gens, against whom I have pronounced, turn from their malum, I will repent of the malum that I thought to do unto them.",
  "9 And at what instant I shall speak concerning a gens, and concerning a regnum, to build and to plant it;",
  "10 If it do malum in my sight, that it obey not my vocem, then I will repent of the bonum, wherewith I said I would beneficium them.",
  "11 Now therefore go to, speak to the homines of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I frame malum against you, and devise a consilium against you: return ye now every one from his malus via, and make your vias and your opera bonum.",
  "12 And they said, There is no spes: but we will walk after our own imaginatio, and we will every one do the stubbornness of his malus cor.",
  "13 Therefore thus saith the Lord; Ask ye now among the gentes, Who hath heard such things? the virgin of Israel hath done a very horrible res.",
  "14 Doth the nix of the field break forth, and flow away suddenly in the montes? or shall the nix be taken away from the place where it was born?",
  "15 Yet my people hath forgotten me, they have sacrificed to nihilum; and they have caused them to stumble in their vias from the antiquus via, to walk in a semita that is not strata:",
  "16 That they may be for a desolatio, for a reproach among the gentes, and a laughing-stock among all gentes that are round about them.",
  "17 Like a vessel wherein is no usus, thus shall ye be unto me, O house of Israel, saith the Lord.",
  "18 Behold, I will come to the prophetas of Samaria, who prophesied in Baal, and caused my people Israel to err.",
  "19 Behold, I am against the prophetas, saith the Lord, that use their lingua, and say, He saith.",
  "20 Behold, I am against them that prophesy falsa visiones, saith the Lord, and that tell a mendacium, and that cause my people to err by their mendacia, and by their arrogantia; though I sent them not, nor commanded them: therefore they shall not profit this people at all, saith the Lord.",
  "21 Thus saith the Lord of the exercitus, the God of Israel; Put your burdens in your manus, and I will carry you, saith the Lord.",
  "22 Be not afraid of the facies of the gentes, neither be ye afraid of their voces; for I am with you, saith the Lord, to save you.",
  "23 For I will give you a mouth and sapientia, which all your adversarii shall not be able to gainsay nor resist.",
  "24 Ye have not hearkened unto me, saith the Lord; ye have not obeyed my vocem.",
  "25 I have sent also unto you all my servos the prophetas, rising up early and sending them, saying, Return ye now every man from his malus via, and amend your opera, and go not after other dei, to serve them, and ye shall dwell in the terra which I have given unto you and to your patres: but ye have not inclined your aurem, nor hearkened unto me.",
  "26 Because ye have not hearkened unto me, I will send for all the familiae of the aquilon, saith the Lord, and Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servus, and will bring them against this terra, and against the inhabitants thereof, and against all these gentes round about, and will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and an hissing, and perpetual desolations.",
  "27 Yet hear the word of the Lord, O ye homines of Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; Thus saith the Lord; Learn not the via of the gentes, and be not dismayed at the signa of caelum; for the gentes are dismayed at them."
