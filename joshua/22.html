                    <p>Then Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh,</p>
<p>And said unto them, Ye have kept all that Moses the servus of the Lord commanded you, and have obeyed my vox, in all that I commanded you:</p>
<p>Ye have not left your fratres these many dies, unto this day, but have kept the mandatum of the Lord your Deus.</p>
<p>And now the Lord your Deus hath given rest unto your fratres, as he promised them: therefore now return ye, and go to your tabernacula, unto the terra of your possession, which Moses the servus of the Lord gave you on the other side Jordan.</p>
<p>But take diligent heed to do the mandatum and the lex, which Moses the servus of the Lord charged you, to love the Lord your Deus, and to walk in all his viae, and to keep his mandata, and to cleave unto him, and to serve him with all your cor, and with all your anima.</p>
<p>So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away: and they went unto their tabernacula.</p>
<p>Now to the one half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given possession in Bashan: but unto the other half thereof gave Joshua among their fratres on this side Jordan westward. And when Joshua sent them away also unto their tabernacula, then he blessed them,</p>
<p>And he spake unto them, saying, Return with much substantia unto your tabernacula, and with very much pecunia, with argentum, and aurum, and ferrum, and vestimenta, in great abundance, and with the spoil of your inimici, which ye have taken from them:</p>
<p>Your fratres have been obedient unto the mandatum of the Lord your Deus, and have waited for you, until the Lord your Deus should give you rest, as he hath given it unto us: and now return ye, and go unto your tabernacula, unto the terra of your possession.</p>
<p>And when they came unto the borders of Jordan, that are in the terra of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh built there an altare by Jordan, a great altare to see to;</p>
<p>And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh have built an altare over against the terra of Canaan, in the borders of Jordan, at the passage of the children of Israel.</p>
<p>And when the children of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh, to go up to war against them.</p>
<p>And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, Phinehas the filius of Eleazar the pontifex,</p>
<p>And with him ten principes, of each chief house a prince throughout all the tribes of Israel; and each one was an head of the house of their patres among the thousands of Israel.</p>
<p>And they came unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, unto the terra of Gilead, and they spake with them, saying,</p>
<p>Thus saith the whole congregation of the Lord, What transgression is this that ye have committed against the Deus of Israel, to turn away this day from following the Lord, in that ye have builded you an altare, that ye might rebel this day against the Lord?</p>
<p>Is the iniquitas of Peor too little for us, from which we are not cleansed until this day, although there was a plague in the congregation of the Lord,</p>
<p>But that ye must turn away this day from following the Lord? and it will be, seeing ye rebel to day against the Lord, that to morrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of Israel.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding, if the terra of your possession be unclean, then pass ye over unto the terra of the possession of the Lord, wherein the Lord's tabernaculum dwelleth, and take possession among us: but rebel not against the Lord, nor rebel against us, in building you an altare beside the altare of the Lord our Deus.</p>
<p>Did not Achan the filius of Zerah commit a transgression in the anathema, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? and that man perished not alone in his iniquitas.</p>
<p>Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh answered, and said unto the heads of the thousands of Israel,</p>
<p>The Lord Deus of gods, the Lord Deus of gods, he knoweth, and Israel he shall know; if it be in rebellion, or if in transgression against the Lord, (save us not this day,)</p>
<p>That we have built us an altare to turn away from following the Lord, or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meat offering, or if to offer peace offerings thereon, let the Lord himself require it;</p>
<p>And if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing, saying, In time to come your children might speak unto our children, saying, What have ye to do with the Lord Deus of Israel?</p>
<p>For the Lord hath made Jordan a border between us and you, ye children of Reuben and children of Gad; ye have no part in the Lord: so shall your children make our children cease from fearing the Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altare, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice:</p>
<p>But that it may be a witness between us, and you, and our generations after us, that we might do the servitium of the Lord before him with our burnt offerings, and with our sacrifices, and with our peace offerings; that your children may not say to our children in time to come, Ye have no part in the Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they should so say to us or to our generations in time to come, that we may say again, Behold the pattern of the altare of the Lord, which our patres made, not for burnt offerings, nor for sacrifices; but it is a witness between us and you.</p>
<p>God forbid that we should rebel against the Lord, and turn this day from following the Lord, to build an altare for burnt offerings, for meat offerings, or for sacrifices, beside the altare of the Lord our Deus that is before his tabernaculum.</p>
<p>And when Phinehas the pontifex, and the principes of the congregation and heads of the thousands of Israel which were with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spake, it pleased them.</p>
<p>And Phinehas the filius of Eleazar the pontifex said unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh, This day we perceive that the Lord is among us, because ye have not committed this transgression against the Lord: now ye have delivered the children of Israel out of the manus of the Lord.</p>
<p>And Phinehas the filius of Eleazar the pontifex, and the principes, returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, out of the terra of Gilead, unto the terra of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them word again.</p>
<p>And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of Israel blessed Deus, and did not intend to go up against them in war, to destroy the terra of the children of Reuben and Gad.</p>
<p>And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altare Ed: for it shall be a witness between us that the Lord is Deus.</p>
