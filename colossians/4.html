                    <p>Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in omni opera willing to live honest√¶, desiring also that ye do the same unto us.</p>
<p>The brethren salutate you. Greet ye also the brethren with sancta oscula.</p>
<p>Salute ye them of the casa Nymphas, and the ecclesia which is in their domus.</p>
<p>Marcum, the cousin germanus of Barnabas, touching whom ye received mandata: if he come unto you, receive him;</p>
<p>And Jesus, who is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These only are my cooperatori in the regnum Dei, and they have been a solatium to me.</p>
<p>Epaphras, who is one of you, a servus Christi, saluteth you, always labouring in orationi, that ye may stand perfecti and completi in omni voluntate Dei.</p>
<p>For I bear him testimonium, that he hath a zelo magnus for you, and them in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis.</p>
<p>Salute ye her who is electa, and my fratrem Nymphas, and the ecclesiam which is in their domus.</p>
<p>Salutate Archippum, my fellowmilites, and Apphiam, my beloved, and them which are in Laodicea, and them that are with Onesimus, my beloved.</p>
<p>Say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministerium which thou hast received in Domini, that thou fulfill it.</p>
<p>The salutatio by the hand of me Paul. Remember my vincula. Grace be with you. Amen.</p>
