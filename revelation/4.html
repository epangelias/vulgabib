                    <p>After these things I looked, and behold, a door was opened in caelum, and the voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be done hereafter.</p>
<p>And immediately I was in the Spirit: and behold, a throne was set in caelum, and one sat on the throne.</p>
<p>And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone: and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald.</p>
<p>And round about the throne were four and twenty sedes, and upon the sedes I saw four and twenty anciani sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their capita crowns of aurum.</p>
<p>And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices: and there were seven lampades of ignis burning before the throne, which are the seven Spiritus of Deus.</p>
<p>And before the throne there was a sea of vitrum like unto cristallum: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four animalia full of oculi before and behind.</p>
<p>And the four animalia had each of them six alas; and they were full of oculi within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Sanctus, Sanctus, Sanctus, Dominus Deus Omnipotens, who was, and is, and is to come.</p>
