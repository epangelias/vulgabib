                    <p>And it came to pass after these things, that Deus tempted Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Ecce me.</p>
<p>And he said, Take nunc thy son, thy only son Isaac, quem amas, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a holocaustum upon one of the montes which I will tell thee of.</p>
<p>And Abraham rose up early in the mane, and saddled his asinus, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the ligna for the holocaustum, and rose up, and went unto the place of which Deus had spoken.</p>
<p>Then on the tertius day Abraham lifted up his oculi, and saw the locum afar off.</p>
<p>And Abraham said unto his young men, Expectate hic with the asinus; and I and the puer will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.</p>
<p>And Abraham took the ligna of the holocaustum, and laid them upon Isaac his son; and he took the ignis in his manu, and a gladius in his altera manu; and they went both of them together.</p>
<p>And Isaac spake unto Abraham his pater, and said, Pater meus. And he said, Ecce me, my son. And he said, Ecce the ignis and the ligna: but where is the victima for a holocaustum?</p>
<p>And Abraham said, Deus will provide himself a victima for a holocaustum, my son: so they went both of them together.</p>
<p>And they came to the locum which Deus had spoken of; and Abraham built an altare there, and laid the ligna in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altare upon the ligna.</p>
<p>And Abraham stretched out his manu, and took the gladius to slay his son.</p>
<p>And the angelus of Deus called unto him out of caelum, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Ecce me.</p>
<p>And he said, Lay not thy manu upon the puer, neither do thou any thing unto him: for nunc I know that thou fearest Deus, seeing thou hast not withholden thy son, thy only son from me.</p>
<p>And Abraham lifted up his oculi, and saw behind him a aries caught in a thicket by his cornua: and Abraham went and took the aries, and offered him up for a holocaustum in the stead of his son.</p>
<p>And Abraham called the name of that locum Jehovahjireh: as it is said to this day, In the monte of Jehovah it shall be provided.</p>
<p>And the angelus of Deus called unto Abraham out of caelum the secundus time,</p>
<p>And said, By myself have I sworn, saith Deus, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withholden thy son, thy only son:</p>
<p>That in benedictione I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy semen as the stellae of the caelum, and as the arena upon the litoris of the mare; and thy semen shall possess the porta of his enemies;</p>
<p>And in thy semen shall all the gentes of the terra be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my vocem.</p>
<p>So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba.</p>
<p>And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Ecce, Milcah, she hath also borne filii unto thy frater Nahor;</p>
