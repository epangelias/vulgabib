                    <p>I cried unto God with my vocem, even unto God with my vocem; and he gave heed unto me.</p>
<p>In the die of my trouble I sought the Dominus: my manus were stretched out in the nocte, and slackened not: my animus refused to be comforted.</p>
<p>I remembered Deus, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah.</p>
<p>Thou holdest mine oculi waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak.</p>
<p>I have considered the dies of old, the annos of ancient times.</p>
<p>I call to remembrance my canticum in the nocte: I commune with mine own cor, and my spirit made diligent inquisition.</p>
<p>Will the Dominus cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more?</p>
<p>Is his misericordia clean gone for ever? doth his promissio fail for evermore?</p>
<p>Hath Deus forgotten to be gracious? hath he in ira shut up his clementiam? Selah.</p>
<p>And I said, This is my infirmitas: but I will remember the annos of the right manus of the Most High.</p>
<p>I will remember the opera of the Dominus: surely I will remember thy miracula of old.</p>
<p>I will meditate also of all thy opera, and my lingua shall speak of thy iustitia.</p>
<p>Thy via, O Deus, is in sanctuario: who is so great a Deus as our Deus?</p>
<p>Thou art the Deus that doest mirabilia: thou hast declared thy potentiam among the populis.</p>
<p>Thou hast with thy manus redeemed thy populum, the filios of Iacob and Ioseph. Selah.</p>
<p>The aquae saw thee, O Deus, the aquae saw thee; they were afraid: the abyssi also were troubled.</p>
<p>The nubes poured out water: the caeli thundered: thine sagitta also went abroad.</p>
<p>The vocem of thy tonitru was in the orbis: the luci also were seen in the mundus: the terra was shaken and trembled.</p>
<p>Thy via is in the mari, and thy semita in the magnis aquibus: and thy vestigia were not knowen.</p>
<p>Thou leddest thy populum like a grex, by the manus of Moses and Aaron.</p>
<p>Thou leddest thy populum like a grex, by the manus of Moses and Aaron.</p>
