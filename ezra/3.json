  "Then Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from Shittim, and came to Iordanis, he and all the filii of Israel, and lodged there before they passed over.",
  "And it came to pass after tres dies, that the officers went through the castra,",
  "And they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the arca foederis Dominus, and the sacerdotes and Levitae bearing her, then ye shall remove from your place, and go after her.",
  "Yet there shall be a spacium between you and her; about duobus milibus metrorum by mensura: come not near her, that ye may know the way by which ye must go: for ye have not passed this way heretofore.",
  "And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves: for tomorrow Dominus will do mirabilia in medio vestri.",
  "And Joshua spake unto the sacerdotes, saying, Take up the arca foederis, and pass before the people. And they took up the arca foederis, and went before the people.",
  "And Dominus said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee.",
  "And thou shalt command the sacerdotes that bear the arca foederis, saying, When ye come to the edge of the aquae Iordanis, ye shall stand still in Iordanis.",
  "Then Joshua said unto the filii of Israel, Come hither, and hear the verba of Dominus your Deus.",
  "And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that Deus vivens is among you, and that He will without fail expellere the Chananaeus, and Hethaeus, and Hevaeus, and Pherezaeus, and Gergesaeus, and Jebusaeus.",
  "Behold, the arca foederis Dominus of all the terra is passing over before you;",
  "Pass over before the arca Dominus your Deus into the medium Iordanis, and stand with every vir of you against his frater.",
  "For Dominus your Deus dried up the aquae of Iordanis from before you, until ye were passed over, as Dominus your Deus did to the Mare Rubrum, which we dried up from before us, until we were passed over;",
  "That all the populorum of the terra may know the manus of Dominus, that it is potentia, that ye may fear Dominus your Deus for evermore.",
  "And it came to pass, when the sacerdotes that bare the arca foederis Dominus were come up out of the medium Iordanis, and the planta of the sacerdotes' pedes were set upon terra siccum, that the aquae of Iordanis returned unto their locus, and flowed over omnis ripa of him, as they did before.",
  "And the people came up out of Iordanis on the decimus day of the mensem of the first mensem, and they encamped in Galgalas, at the edge of the campi of Iericho.",
  "And these duodecim lapides, which they took out of Iordanis, did Joshua pitch in Galgalas,",
  "Saying, When your filii shall ask their patres in time to come, saying, What mean these lapides?",
  "Then ye shall let your filii know, saying, Israel passed over this Iordanis on terra siccum.",
  "For Dominus your Deus dried up the aquae of Iordanis from before them, until they were passed over, as Dominus your Deus did to the Mare Rubrum, which we dried up from before us:",
  "That all the populorum of the terra may know the manus of Dominus, that it is potentia; that ye might fear Dominus your Deus for evermore."
