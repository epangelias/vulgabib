                    <p>My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we receive the greater damnatio, because ye shall receive the greater iudicium.</p>
<p>For in many things we offend all, if any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect homo, able also to bridle the whole corpus.</p>
<p>Behold, we put bits in the mouths of equi, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole corpus.</p>
<p>Behold also the naucleri, how they guide the great ship, although it is so great, and is driven of fierce venti.</p>
<p>Even so the lingua is a little membrum, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a materiam a little ignis kindleth!</p>
<p>And the lingua is a ignis, a world of iniquitas: so is the lingua among our membra, that it defileth the whole corpus, and setteth on fire the rotam of our vita, and is set on fire of gehenna.</p>
<p>For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpentes, and of things in the mari, hath been tamed of the humani genus:</p>
<p>But the lingua can no man tame; it is an unruly malum, full of deadly venenum.</p>
<p>Therewith bless we the Deus and Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitudo of Deus.</p>
<p>Out of the same os proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.</p>
<p>Doth a fons send forth at the same place dulcem and amarum water?</p>
<p>Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olivas, or a vine, figs? so can no fons both yield dulcem and amarum water.</p>
