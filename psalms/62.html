                    <p>Truly my soul waiteth upon Deus, from him cometh my salvation.</p>
<p>He only is my rock and my salvation; he is my defence; I shall not be greatly moved.</p>
<p>How long will ye imagine mischief against a man? ye shall be slain all of you: as a bowing wall shall ye be, and as a tottering fence.</p>
<p>They only consult to cast him down from his excellency: they delight in lies: they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah.</p>
<p>My soul, wait thou only upon Deus; for my expectation is from him.</p>
<p>He only is my rock and my salvation: he is my defence; I shall not be moved.</p>
<p>In Deus is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in Deus.</p>
<p>Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before him: Deus is a refuge for us. Selah.</p>
<p>Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie: to be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than vanity.</p>
<p>Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if riches increase, set not your heart upon them.</p>
<p> Deus hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power belongeth unto Deus.</p>
<p>Also unto thee, O Deus, belongeth mercy: for thou renderest to every man according to his work.</p>
