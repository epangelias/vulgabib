                    <p>After these things the Lord appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, whither he himself would come.</p>
<p>Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly is great, but the labourers are pauci.</p>
<p>Pray ye therefore the Dominus of the harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest.</p>
<p>Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as agni among lupi.</p>
<p>Carry neither scrip, nor pera, nor calceamenta: and salute no man by the way.</p>
<p>And into whatsoever domus ye enter, first say, Pax huic domui.</p>
<p>And if the filius pacis be there, your pax shall rest upon it: if not, it shall turn to you again.</p>
<p>And remain in the same domus, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the operarius is worthy of his merces.</p>
<p>Go not from domus to domus.</p>
<p>And into whatsoever civitas ye enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you:</p>
<p>And heal the infirmi that are therein, and say unto them, The regnum Dei is come nigh unto you.</p>
<p>But into whatsoever civitas ye enter, and they receive you not, go your ways out into the plateas of the same, and say,</p>
<p>Even the pulverem of your civitas, which cleaveth on us, we wipe off against you: notwithstanding be ye sure of this, that the regnum Dei is come nigh unto you.</p>
<p>But I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerabile in that die for Sodoma, than for that civitas.</p>
<p>Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the virtutes that have been done in you, had been done in Tyro and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in cilicio and cinere.</p>
<p>But it shall be more tolerabile for Tyro and Sidon at iudicium, than for you.</p>
<p>And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to caelum, shalt be thrust down to infernus.</p>
<p>He that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me.</p>
<p>And the seventy returned again with gaudeo, saying, Domine, etiam daemonia are subject unto us through thy nomen.</p>
<p>And he said unto them, I saw Satanas as fulmen from caelum.</p>
<p>Behold, I give unto you potestas to tread on serpentes and scorpiones, and over all the virtus of the inimicus: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spiritus are subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your nomina are written in caelis.</p>
<p>In that hora Jesus exulted in Spiritu Sancto, and said, I thank thee, Pater, Domine of caelum and terra, that thou hast hid these things from sapientes and prudentes, and hast revealed them unto parvuli.</p>
<p>Even so, Pater; for so it seemed good in thy sight.</p>
<p>All things are delivered to me of my Pater: and no man knoweth who the Filius is, but the Pater; and who the Pater is, but the Filius, and he to whom the Filius will reveal him.</p>
<p>And he turned him unto his discipuli, and said privately, Beati oculi qui vident quae vos videtis:</p>
<p>For I tell you, that many prophetae and reges have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.</p>
<p>And, behold, a certain iuris peritus stood up, and tempted him, saying, Magister, quid faciendo vitam aeternam possidebo?</p>
<p>And he said unto him, What is written in lege? how readest thou?</p>
<p>And he answering said, Thou shalt diligere Dominum Deum tuum ex toto corde tuo, et ex tota anima tua, et ex omnibus viribus tuis, et ex omni mente tua; et proximum tuum sicut teipsum.</p>
<p>And he said unto him, Recte respondisti: hoc fac, et vives.</p>
<p>But he, willing to iustificari, said unto Jesus, Et quis est meus proximus?</p>
<p>And Jesus answering said, A certain homo descending from Hierosolyma in Hiericho, incidit in latrones, qui etiam spoliaverunt eum, et plagis vulneraverunt, et abierunt, semotis relinquentes eum semivivo.</p>
<p>Et casu quidam sacerdos descendebat eadem via: et videns eum, pertransiit.</p>
<p>Similiter et Levita, cum esset secus locum, et vidisset eum, pertransiit.</p>
<p>Sed Samaritanus quidam, iter faciens, venit supra eum, et videns eum, misericordia motus est:</p>
<p>Et appropinquans, alligavit vulnera eius, infundens oleum et vinum, et imposuit eum in iumentum suum, et duxit in stabulum, et curam eius egit.</p>
<p>Et altera die protulit duos denarios, et dedit stabulario, et ait, Curam habe de illo, et quodcumque supererogaveris, ego cum rediero reddam tibi.</p>
<p>Quis horum trium videtur tibi proximus fuisse illi, qui incidit in latrones?</p>
<p>Et ait, Qui misericordiam eius fecit. Dixitque illi Jesus, Vade, et tu fac similiter.</p>
<p>Et factum est, cum irent, ipse intravit in quoddam castellum: et mulier quaedam, Martha nomine, excepit illum in domum suam.</p>
<p>Et huic erat soror nomine Maria, quae sedens secus pedes Domini, audiebat verbum illius.</p>
<p>Martha autem satagebat circa frequens ministerium: et stetit, et ait, Domine, non est tibi cura, quod soror mea reliquit me solam ministrare? dic ergo illi, ut me adiuvet.</p>
<p>Et respondens dixit illi Dominus, Martha, Martha, sollicita es, et turbaris erga plurima:</p>
<p>Sed unum est necessarium. Maria optimam partem elegit, quae non auferetur ab ea.</p>
