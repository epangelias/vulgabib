                    <p>When Israel was a child, then I amavit him, and called my filius out of Aegyptum.</p>
<p>As they called them, so they went from them: they sacrificaverunt unto Baalim, and burned incense to graven imagines.</p>
<p>Therefore have I writtus to him, the viae of the Domini: he shall convert me, and I will multiplicare his messis, and make my medicina to florere.</p>
<p>I will be to him a pastor, and he shall ambulare post me: I will convert his populus, and he shall multiplicare his messis.</p>
<p>I will bring him back, and he shall habiter in his tabernaculum, and he shall florere as the rosae, and he shall odorare as the Libanus.</p>
<p>His radices shall extend to mare, and his rami shall florere to flumen.</p>
<p>Ephraim shall dicere, What have I to do any more with idola? I will respondere, and lo, I will florere as the cupressus: my fructus shall be from me.</p>
<p>Who is sapiens, and he shall intelligere these? prudent, and he shall cognoscere them? for the viae of the Domini are rectae, and the iusti shall ambulare in eis: but the transgressores shall offendere in eis.</p>
