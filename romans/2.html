                    <p>Therefore thou art inexcusable, O homo, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things.</p>
<p>But we are sure that the judicium of God is according to veritas against them which commit such things.</p>
<p>And thinkest thou this, O homo, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judicium of God?</p>
<p>Or despisest thou the riches of his benignitas and patientia and longsuffering; not knowing that the benignitas of God leadeth thee to paenitentia?</p>
<p>But after thy hardness and impenitent cor, treasurest up for thyself ira against the dies of ira and revelation of the just judicium of God;</p>
<p>Who will render to every homo according to his opera.</p>
<p>To them who by patientia in good opera seek for gloria and honor and immortalitas, eternal vita:</p>
<p>But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the veritas, but obey injustitia, indignatio and ira;</p>
<p>Tribulatio and angustia, upon every anima of homo that doth evil, of the Iudaeus first, and also of the Gentilis;</p>
<p>But gloria, honor, and pax, to every homo that worketh good, to the Iudaeus first, and also to the Gentilis:</p>
<p>For there is no respect of personas with God.</p>
<p>For as many as have sinned without lex shall also perish without lex: and as many as have sinned in the lex shall be judged by the lex;</p>
<p>For not the audientes of the lex are justi before God, but the doers of the lex shall be justified.</p>
<p>For when the Gentiles, which have not the lex, do by natura the things contained in the lex, these, having not the lex, are a lex unto themselves:</p>
<p>Which shew the opera of the lex written in their corda, their conscientia also bearing witness, and their cogitationes the meanwhile accusing or else excusing one another;)</p>
<p>In the dies when God shall judge the secrets of homo by Iesus Christ according to my evangelium.</p>
<p>Behold, thou art called a Iudaeus, and restest in the lex, and makest thy boast of God,</p>
<p>And knowest his voluntas, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the lex;</p>
<p>And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the caeci, a light of them which are in tenebris,</p>
<p>An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the forma of knowledge and of the veritas in the lex.</p>
<p>Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not furari, furaris:</p>
<p>Thou that sayest a man should not adulterari, adulteras: thou that abhorrest idols, thou committest sacrilegium;</p>
<p>Thou that makest thy boast of the lex, through breaking the lex dishonorest thou God?</p>
<p>For the nomen of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.</p>
<p>Circumcisio verily profiteth, if thou keep the lex: but if thou be a transgressor of the lex, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.</p>
<p>Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the justa opera of the lex, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?</p>
<p>And shall not uncircumcision which is by natura, if it fulfill the lex, judge thee, who by the littera and circumcision dost transgress the lex?</p>
<p>For he is not a Iudaeus, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in carne:</p>
<p>But he is a Iudaeus, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the cor, in spirit, not in littera; whose laus is not of homo, but of God.</p>
