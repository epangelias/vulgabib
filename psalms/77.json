  "I cried unto God with my vocem, even unto God with my vocem; and he gave heed unto me.",
  "In the die of my trouble I sought the Dominus: my manus were stretched out in the nocte, and slackened not: my animus refused to be comforted.",
  "I remembered Deus, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah.",
  "Thou holdest mine oculi waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak.",
  "I have considered the dies of old, the annos of ancient times.",
  "I call to remembrance my canticum in the nocte: I commune with mine own cor, and my spirit made diligent inquisition.",
  "Will the Dominus cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more?",
  "Is his misericordia clean gone for ever? doth his promissio fail for evermore?",
  "Hath Deus forgotten to be gracious? hath he in ira shut up his clementiam? Selah.",
  "And I said, This is my infirmitas: but I will remember the annos of the right manus of the Most High.",
  "I will remember the opera of the Dominus: surely I will remember thy miracula of old.",
  "I will meditate also of all thy opera, and my lingua shall speak of thy iustitia.",
  "Thy via, O Deus, is in sanctuario: who is so great a Deus as our Deus?",
  "Thou art the Deus that doest mirabilia: thou hast declared thy potentiam among the populis.",
  "Thou hast with thy manus redeemed thy populum, the filios of Iacob and Ioseph. Selah.",
  "The aquae saw thee, O Deus, the aquae saw thee; they were afraid: the abyssi also were troubled.",
  "The nubes poured out water: the caeli thundered: thine sagitta also went abroad.",
  "The vocem of thy tonitru was in the orbis: the luci also were seen in the mundus: the terra was shaken and trembled.",
  "Thy via is in the mari, and thy semita in the magnis aquibus: and thy vestigia were not knowen.",
  "Thou leddest thy populum like a grex, by the manus of Moses and Aaron.",
  "Thou leddest thy populum like a grex, by the manus of Moses and Aaron."
