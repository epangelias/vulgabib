                    <p>A Prayer of Moses the man of Deus. Domine, thou hast been our habitatio from generation to generation.</p>
<p>Before the montes were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the terra and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art Deus.</p>
<p>Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Returne, ye filii hominum.</p>
<p>For a mille anni are in thy sight but as yesterday when it is past, and as a vigilia in the night.</p>
<p>Thou carriest them away as with a flumen they are as a somnium, as gramine that groweth in the morning.</p>
<p>In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it is cut down, and withereth.</p>
<p>For we are consumsed by thy furor, and by thy ira are we troubled.</p>
<p>Thou hast set our iniquitates before thee, our secreti are in the light of thy facies.</p>
<p>For all our dies are passed away in thy ira: we spend our anni as a sermonem.</p>
<p>The dies of our anni are threescore anni and ten; and if by reason of fortitudo they be fourscore anni, yet is their strength labor and dolor: for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.</p>
<p>Who knoweth the potestatem of thy ira? even according to thy timor, so is thy furor.</p>
<p>So teach us to numerare our dies, that we may applicare our corda unto sapientia.</p>
<p>Turne thou us againe, O Deus of hostes; and cause thy facies to shine; that we may be salvati.</p>
<p>Make us glad according to the dies wherein thou hast afflictus us, and the anni wherein we have seen malum.</p>
<p>Let thy opera appear unto thy servi, and thy gloria in their filii.</p>
<p>And let the gratia of the Domine nostri Deus be upon us; and establish thou the opera of our manus upon us; yea, the opera of our manos establish thou it.</p>
<p>O satisfy us in the matutino with thy misericordia; that we may rejoice and be glad all our dies.</p>
<p>Make us glad according to the dies wherein thou hast afflictus us, and the anni wherein we have seen malum.</p>
