                    <p>Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? whither is thy beloved turned aside? that we may seek him with thee. My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.</p>
<p>I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine: he feedeth among the lilies.</p>
<p>Thou art as beautiful as Tirzah, my love, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as an exercitus hostium.</p>
<p>Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me: thy hair is as a flock of caprae, that appear from Gilead.</p>
<p>Thy teeth are as a flock of oves, which go up from the lavacrum, whereof every one beareth twins, and there is not one sterile among them.</p>
<p>As the malus of one pomegranate are thy tempora within thy locks.</p>
<p>There are threescore reginae, and fourscore concubinae, and virgins without number.</p>
<p>My dove, my perfect one, is but one, she is the only one of her mother, she is the electa of her that bare her. The filiae saw her, and blessed her; yea, the reginae and the concubinae, and they praised her.</p>
<p>Who is she that looketh forth as the aurora, fair as the luna, clear as the sol, terrible as an exercitus hostium arrayed?</p>
<p>I went down into the hortus of nutricium, to see the ver sativi, and to see if the vine flourished, and the granatum budded.</p>
<p>Or ever I was aware, my soul made me like the currus of Amminadib.</p>
<p>Return, return, O Sulamitis; return, return, that we may look upon thee. What will ye see in the Sulamitis? As it were the chorus of two castra.</p>
