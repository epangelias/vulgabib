  "Remind them to be subject to principes and potestates, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,",
  "For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving various cupiditates and pleasures, living in malitia and envy, hateful, and hating one another.",
  "But when the benignitas and amor of Deus our Saviour toward man appeared,",
  "Not by works of justitia which we have done, but according to his misericordia he saved us, by the lavacrum regenerationis, and renovatio Spiritus Sancti;",
  "Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;",
  "That being justified by his gratia, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.",
  "This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in Deus might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.",
  "But avoid foolish questions, and genealogias, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.",
  "A man that is a haereticus after the first and second admonition reject;",
  "Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself.",
  "When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.",
  "Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.",
  "Our friends salute thee. Greet them that love us in fide. Gratia be with you all. Amen."
