                    <p>Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but caritas edificat.</p>
<p>If any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.</p>
<p>But if any man love Deus, the same is cognitus of him.</p>
<p>As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrificium to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the mundus, and that there is none other Deus but one.</p>
<p>For though there be that are called dii, whether in caelum, or in terra, (as there be many dii, and many domini,)</p>
<p>But to us there is but one Deus, the Pater, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Dominus, Iesus Christus, by whom are all things, and we by him.</p>
<p>Howbeit there is not in omnes scientia. For some with consciencia of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol; and their consciencia being debilis is defiled.</p>
<p>But meat commendeth us not to Deus: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse.</p>
<p>But take heed lest by any means this libertas of yours become a scandalum to them that are infirmi.</p>
<p>For if any man see thee which hast scientia sit at meat in the idol's templum, shall not the consciencia of him which is infirmi be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols;</p>
<p>And through thy scientia shall the infirmus frater perish, for whom Christus died?</p>
<p>But when ye sin so against the fratres, and wound their infirma consciencia, ye sin against Christus.</p>
<p>Wherefore, if meat make my frater to offend, I will eat no flesh while the mundus standeth; lest I make my frater to offend.</p>
