  "I waited patiently for the Domini: and he inclined unto me, and heard my clamor.",
  "He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my pedes upon a petra, and established my gressus.",
  "And he hath put a novum canticum in my os, even laudem Dei. Many shall see it, and fear, and shall put their trust in the Dominus.",
  "Blessed is that man that maketh the Dominum his trust, and respecteth not the superbos, nor such as turn aside unto mendacia.",
  "Many, O Dominus my Deus, are thy mirabilia which thou hast done, and thy cogitationes which are to us-ward: they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee: if I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be numerus.",
  "Sacrificium and oblation thou didst not desiderare; mine aures hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required.",
  "Then said I, Ecce, I come: in the volumine of the libro it is written of me,",
  "I delitescere in the voluntas of the Domini, O Deus meus: yea, thy lex is within my cor.",
  "I have preached justitiam in the great congregation: lo, I have not refrained my labia, O Dominus, thou knowest.",
  "I have not hid thy justitiam within my cor: I have declared thy fidelitas and thy salvus: I have not concealed thy misericordia and thy veritas from the great congregation.",
  "Withhold not thou thy misericordias from me, O Dominus: for thy iustitia and thy veritas to ever preserve me.",
  "For innumerable malitiae have compassed me about: mine iniquitates have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the capilli of mine caput: therefore my cor faileth me.",
  "Be pleased, O Dominus, to deliver me: O Dominus, make haste to help me.",
  "Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my animam to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to confusion that desire my hurt.",
  "Let them be desolati for a reward of their turpitudo: who say unto me, Aha, aha.",
  "Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let such as love thy salvus say continually, The Dominus be magnified.",
  "But I am pauper and needy; yet the Dominus careth for me: thou art my adjutor and my liberator; make no tarrying, O Deus meus."
