                    <p>The king shall joy in thy strength, O Domine, and in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice!</p>
<p>Thou hast given him his cor, O Domine, and hast not withholden the request of his lips.</p>
<p>For thou preventest him with benedictiones of bonus, thou settest a corona of aurum on his caput.</p>
<p>He asked life of thee, and thou gavest it him, even length of dies for ever and ever.</p>
<p>His honor is great in thy salvation: honor and majesty hast thou laid upon him.</p>
<p>For thou hast made him most blessed for ever: thou hast made him joyful with felicitas.</p>
<p>For the king trusteth in the Domine, and through the clementia of the Altissimus he shall not be moved.</p>
<p>Thine hand shall find out all thine inimici: thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee.</p>
<p>Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thy facies: the Domine shall swallow them up in his ira, and the fire shall devour them.</p>
<p>Their fructus shalt thou destroy from the terra, and their semen from among the filii of men.</p>
<p>For they intended malum against thee: they imagined a consilium, but they are not able to perform it.</p>
<p>Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back, when thou shalt make ready thy arcus against the facies of them.</p>
<p>Be thou exalted, Domine, in thy potentia: so will we sing and praise thy potentia.</p>
