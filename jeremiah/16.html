                    <p>1 The word of the Dominus came also unto me, saying,</p>
<p>2 Thou shalt not take thee a uxor of the daughters of Canaan, neither shalt thou give thy filius in marriage unto the daughters of Canaan.</p>
<p>3 For they shall turn away thy filius from following me, that they may servire other deos: so will the ire of the Dominus be kindled against you, and destroy thee suddenly.</p>
<p>4 Take heed to thyself, and beware; for thy vita is hid with me, and I will make thee a prophet unto the gentes.</p>
<p>5 And the word of the Dominus came unto me, saying,</p>
<p>6 Thou sayest, Lo, I will not servire: for from my iuventus I was taught to be a pastor and a shepherd; and these things thou hast done unto me, that I should be a prophet unto the gentes.</p>
<p>7 Then said the Dominus unto me, Thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Dominus; If ye will not hear me, to walk in my leges,</p>
<p>8 Which I have set before you, to hearken unto the vox of my servus the prophets, whom I sent unto you, both rising up early, and sending them, but ye have not hearkened;</p>
<p>9 Then shall I make this domus like Shiloh, and will make this civitas a cursing to all the gentes of the earth.</p>
<p>10 And it shall be, when thou shalt shew this populus all these verba, they shall say unto thee, Wherefore hath the Dominus pronounced all this magna malum against us? or what iniquitas is this that we have committed against the Dominus our Deus, that the Dominus hath pronounced against us this magna malum?</p>
<p>11 Then shalt thou say unto them, Because your patres have derelictus me, saith the Dominus, and have walked after other deos, and have servitus them, and have adoratus them, and have derelictus me, and have not kept my mandata;</p>
<p>12 And ye have done worse than your patres; for, behold, ye walk every one after the imagination of his malus cor, that they may not hearken unto me:</p>
<p>13 Therefore will I cast you out of this terra, as I have cast out all your fratres, even the whole seed of Ephraim.</p>
<p>14 As for me, I will dwell in this terra, saith the Dominus, to plant it, and not to pluck it up; for I repent me of the malum that I have done unto it.</p>
<p>15 O Dominus, according to thy iustitia, I shall see thy vultus in iustitia: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy similitudo.</p>
<p>16 O Dominus, according to thy iustitia, I shall see thy vultus in iustitia: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy similitudo.</p>
<p>17 They shall come with weeping, and with supplications will I lead them: I will cause them to walk by the flumen of aqua, in a via recta, wherein they shall not stumble: for I am a Pater unto Israel, and Ephraim is my primogenitus.</p>
<p>18 Behold, the days come, saith the Dominus, that it shall no more be said, The Dominus liveth, that brought up the filii of Israel out of the terra of Aegyptus;</p>
<p>19 But, The Dominus liveth, that brought up the filii of Israel from the terra of the Aquilon, and from all the terrae whither he had expelled them: and I will bring them again into their terra, that I gave unto their patres.</p>
<p>20 Behold, I will send for many piscatores, saith the Dominus, and they shall fish them; and after will I send for many venatores, and they shall hunt them from every monte, and from every collis, and out of the holes of the petrae.</p>
<p>21 For mine oculi are upon all their viae: they are not hid from my facies, neither is their iniquitas hid from mine oculi.</p>
<p>22 And first I will retribuere double unto them their iniquitas and their peccata; because they have polluted my terra with the cadavera of their abomination, and have filled mine hereditas with their detestable things.</p>
<p>23 O Dominus, my fortitudo, and my castrum, and my refugium in die afflictionis, unto thee shall the gentes come from the extremities of the terra, and shall say, Surely our patres have hereditated falsa, and things wherein there is no profectus;</p>
<p>24 Will a homo make deos unto himself, and they are no dii?</p>
<p>25 Therefore, behold, I will yet plead with this gens, saith the Dominus, and with the domus of Iudah.</p>
<p>26 Thus saith the Dominus, What iniquitas is this that I have found in your manus, O Ierusalem? ye are not cleansed from your iniquitas, though ye have walked after the Baalim;</p>
<p>27 Thou shalt not go out with us in the exercitus, saith the Dominus, for ye go not with me to battle: to to-day ye are turned back before the inimicus.</p>
<p>28 Wherefore shall a virguncula, or a puella, die in the exercitus? or shall a uxor of a homo be taken away in the exercitu?</p>
<p>29 Give glory to the Dominus your Deus, before he cause tenebrae, and before your pedes stumble upon the montes of the tenebrae, and, while ye look for lumina, he turn it into the umbra of morte, and make it gross darkness.</p>
<p>30 But if ye will not hear it, my animus shall weep in secret places for your superbia; and mine oculus shall weep sore, and run down with lacrimae, because the Dominus' grex is taken captive.</p>
<p>31 And say, Thus saith the Dominus; Behold, I will cast this civitas into the desolation, and into the hissing; every civitas thereof shall be laid waste, without an inhabitator.</p>
<p>32 And thou shalt say, Thus saith the Dominus; Thus shall this civitas be unto me as a vas, wherein is no delight, but which shall be broken with contrition; yea, thus shall this civitas be unto me.</p>
<p>33 Lo, the days come, saith the Dominus, that I will visit the sculptilia of Israel, and the sculptilia of Iudah, which they have made.</p>
<p>34 Then shall the prophetes say no more to every homo his amicus, Nor shall every homo say to his frater, Know the Dominus: for all shall know me, from the minimus of them unto the maximus of them, saith the Dominus: for I will forgive their iniquitas, and I will remember their peccata no more.</p>
<p>35 Thus saith the Dominus, If my foedus be not with day and nocte, and if I have not appointed the ordines of caelum and terra;</p>
<p>36 Then will I cast away the semen of Iacob, and David my servus, so that I will not take any of his semen to be rulers over the semen of Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob: for I will cause their captivitas to return, and have mercy on them.</p>
