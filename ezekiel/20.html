                    <p>1 And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth month, the tenth day of the month, that certain of the ancients of Israel came to inquire of the Dominus, and sat before me.</p>
<p>2 Then came the word of the Dominus unto me, saying,</p>
<p>3 Son of man, speak unto the ancients of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith Dominus Deus; Are ye come to inquire of me? As I live, saith Dominus Deus, I will not be inquired of by you.</p>
<p>4 Wilt thou judge them, son of man, wilt thou judge them? cause them to know the abominations of their patres.</p>
<p>5 And say unto them, Thus saith Dominus Deus; In the die when I chose Israel, and lifted up mine hand unto the semen of the house of Iacob, and made myself known unto them in the terra Aegypti, when I lifted up mine hand unto them, saying, I am Dominus Deus, your Deus;</p>
<p>6 In that die I lifted up mine hand unto them, to bring them forth out of the terra Aegypti into a terra that I had provided for them, flowing with lac and mel, which is the ornamentum of all the terrae:</p>
<p>7 Then said I unto them, Cast ye away every vir pollutus from before your oculi, and defile not yourselves with the idola Aegyptii: I am Dominus Deus, your Deus.</p>
<p>8 But they rebelled against me, and would not hear me: they did not every vir cast away the pollutus from before their oculi, neither did they forsake the idola Aegyptii: then I said, I will pour out my furor upon them to accomplish my ira against them in the midst of the terra Aegyptii.</p>
<p>9 But I wrought for my nomine's sake, that it should not be pollutus before the gentes, among whom they were, for it was I that made myself known unto them in their eyes, to bring them forth out of the terra Aegyptii.</p>
<p>10 Wherefore I caused them to go forth out of the terra Aegyptii, and brought them into the desert.</p>
<p>11 And I gave them my praecepta, and shewed them my iudicia, which if a man do, he shall live in them.</p>
<p>12 Moreover also I gave them my sabbata, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am Dominus Deus that sanctify them.</p>
<p>13 But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the desert: they walked not in my praecepta, and they despised my iudicia, which if a man do, he shall live in them; and my sabbata they greatly pollutus: then I said, I would pour out my furor upon them in the desert, to consume them.</p>
<p>14 But I wrought for my nomine's sake, that it should not be pollutus before the gentes, in whose sight I brought them out.</p>
<p>15 Yet also I lifted up mine hand unto them in the desert, that I would not bring them into the terra which I had given them, flowing with lac and mel, which is the ornamentum of all the terrae;</p>
<p>16 Because they despised my iudicia, and walked not in my praecepta, but pollutus my sabbata: for their cor followed their idola.</p>
<p>17 Nevertheless mine oculus spared them from destroying them, neither did I make an end of them in the desert.</p>
<p>18 But I said unto their filii in the desert, Walk ye not in the praecepta of your patres, neither observe their iudicia, nor defile yourselves with their pollutus:</p>
<p>19 I am Dominus Deus, your Deus; walk in my praecepta, and observe my iudicia, and do them;</p>
<p>20 And hallow my sabbata; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I am Dominus Deus, your Deus.</p>
<p>21 Notwithstanding the filii rebelled against me: they walked not in my praecepta, neither kept my iudicia to do them, which if a man do, he shall live in them; they pollutus my sabbata: then I said, I would pour out my furor upon them to accomplish my ira against them in the desert.</p>
<p>22 Nevertheless I withdrew mine hand, and wrought for my nomine's sake, that it should not be pollutus in the sight of the gentes, in whose sight I brought them forth.</p>
<p>23 I lifted up mine hand unto them also in the desert, that I would scatter them among the gentes, and disperse them through the terrae;</p>
<p>24 Because they had not executed my iudicia, but had despised my praecepta, and had pollutus my sabbata, and their oculi were after their patres' idola.</p>
<p>25 Wherefore I gave them also praecepta that were not bonum, and iudicia whereby they should not live;</p>
<p>26 And I pollutus them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pass through the ignem all that openeth the vulvam, that I might destroy them, to the intent that they might know that I am Dominus Deus.</p>
<p>27 Therefore, son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith Dominus Deus; Yet in this your patres have blasphemed me, in that they have committed a transgression against me.</p>
<p>28 For when I had brought them into the terra, for the which I lifted up mine hand to give it to them, then they saw every high collis, and all the thick arbusta, and they offered there their victimas, and there they presented the provocation of their oblatio, and there they made their suave odorem, and poured there their libamina.</p>
<p>29 Then I said unto them, What is the high place whereunto ye go? and the nomine thereof is called Bamah unto this die.</p>
<p>30 Wherefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith Dominus Deus; Are ye pollutus after the manner of your patres? and go a fornicari after their abomination?</p>
<p>31 For when ye offer your giftes, when ye make your filios to pass through the ignem, ye pollutus yourselves with all your idola, unto this die; and shall I be inquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live, saith Dominus Deus, I will not be inquired of by you.</p>
<p>32 And that which cometh into your mente shall not be at all, that ye say, We will be as the gentes, as the families of the terrae, to serve lignum and lapidem.</p>
<p>33 As I live, saith Dominus Deus, surely with a potent manus, and with a stretched-out brachium, and with furor poured out, will I rule over you:</p>
<p>34 And I will bring you out from the populis, and will gather you out of the terrae wherein ye are scattered, with a potent manus, and with a stretched-out brachium, and with furor poured out.</p>
<p>35 And I will bring you into the desert of the gentes, and there will I plead with you face to face.</p>
<p>36 Like as I pleaded with your patres in the desert of the terra Aegyptii, so will I plead with you, saith Dominus Deus.</p>
<p>37 And I will cause you to pass under the virga, and I will bring you into the vinculum of the foedus:</p>
<p>38 And I will purge out from among you the rebellios, and them that transgress against me: I will bring them forth out of the terra wherein they sojourn, and they shall not enter into the terra Israel.</p>
<p>39 But as for you, O house of Israel, thus saith Dominus Deus; Go ye, serve ye every man his idola, and hereafter also, if ye will not hearken unto me: but pollutus my sanctuarium no more with your gifts, and with your idola.</p>
<p>40 For in mine sanctuarium shall my sanctuarium be, and I will be honoured among the filii Israel.</p>
<p>41 And for your parte, O house of Israel, thus saith Dominus Deus; Go, serve ye every man his idola, and afterwards, when ye be not obedient unto me, with all your idola and all your abomination, ye shall remember me.</p>
<p>42 And I will be sanctified in you before the oculi of the gentes, and ye shall know that I am Dominus Deus.</p>
<p>43 And ye shall know that I am Dominus Deus, when I shall deal with you for my nomine's sake, not according to your malae viae, nor according to your corrupta opera, O ye house of Israel, saith Dominus Deus.</p>
<p>44 And they, even they, shall know that I am Dominus Deus, when I have dealt with them for my nomine's sake, not according to their malae viae, nor according to their corrupta opera, saith Dominus Deus.</p>
