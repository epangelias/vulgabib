                    <p>Behold, the Lord maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waste, and turneth it upside down, and scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof, et faciet terram vacuam, et nudam, et everterit eam, et disperget habitatores eius.</p>
<p>And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the taker of usury, so with the giver of usury to him, et erit sicut populus, sic sacerdos; sicut servus, sic dominus eius; sicut ancilla, sic domina eius; sicut emptor, sic venditor; sicut fenerator, sic accipiens usuras ab eo.</p>
<p>The earth mourneth and fadeth away, the world languisheth and fadeth away, the haughty people of the earth do languish, terra lugens et arescens, mundo deficiens et arescens, languent super terram potentes populi.</p>
<p>The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof; because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant, terra quoque contaminata est sub habitatoribus suis; quia transgressi sunt leges, mutaverunt praeceptum, ruperunt foedus sempiternum.</p>
<p>Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell therein are desolate: therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left, igitur maledictio voravit terram, et qui habitant in ea desolati sunt; ideoque qui habitant in terra, combusti sunt, et pauci homines relicti sunt.</p>
<p>The new wine mourneth, the vine languisheth, all the merryhearted do sigh, vinum novum lugebat, et vitis languebat, omnes qui gaudebant corde, gemente.</p>
<p>The mirth of tabrets ceaseth, the noise of them that rejoice endeth, the joy of the harp ceaseth, cessavit gaudium tympanorum, finita est vox iucunditatis, tacuit cithara.</p>
<p>They shall not drink wine with a song; strong drink shall be bitter to them that drink it, non bibent vinum in cantico; potus fortis amarus erit bibentibus illum.</p>
<p>The city of confusion is broken down: every house is shut up, that no man may come in, civitas confusionis dissipata est; omnis domus clausa est, ne quis ingrediatur.</p>
<p>There is a crying for wine in the streets; all joy is darkened, the mirth of the land is gone, clamor super vino est in plateis; omnis gaudium obscuratum est, gaudium terrae periit.</p>
<p>In the city is left desolation, and the gate is smitten with destruction, in civitate relicta est desolatio, et porta percussa est in frustum.</p>
<p>When thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the people, there shall be as the shaking of an olive tree, and as the gleaning grapes when the vintage is done, cum his ita erit in medio terrae in populis, quasi si oleae excussae fuerint, et quasi si racemi vindemiae collectae fuerint.</p>
<p>They shall lift up their voice, they shall sing for the majesty of the Lord, they shall cry aloud from the sea, vocem suam levabunt, cantabunt propter maiestatem Domini, clamabunt a mari.</p>
<p>Wherefore glorify ye the Lord in the fires, even the name of the Lord God of Israel in the isles of the sea, ideo in ignibus glorificate Dominum, nomen Domini Dei Israel in insulis maris.</p>
<p>From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs, even glory to the righteous, but I said, My leanness, my leanness, woe unto me! the treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously; yea, the treacherous dealers have dealt very treacherously, ab extremis terrae audivimus laudes, gloriam iusti; sed dixi, Desolatio mea, desolatio mea, vae mihi! praevaricatores praevaricati sunt, et praevaricatores praevaricati sunt praevaricatione.</p>
<p>Fear, and the pit, and the snare, are upon thee, O inhabitant of the earth, pavor, et fovea, et laqueus super te, qui habitas terram.</p>
<p>And it shall come to pass, that he who fleeth from the noise of the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for the windows from on high are open, and the foundations of the earth do shake, et erit, qui fugerit a voce formidinis, cadet in foveam; et qui ascenderit de medio foveae, capietur laqueo; quia cuncta fenestrae de excelso apertae sunt, et fundamenta terrae commota sunt.</p>
<p>The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is clean dissolved, the earth is moved exceedingly, terra prorsus confracta est, terra commota est valde, terra mota est satis.</p>
<p>The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and shall be removed like a cottage; and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it; and it shall fall, and not rise again, terra sicut ebrius vacillabit, et sicut tabernaculum, quod evacuatum est, et peccatum eius grave erit super eam, et corruet, nec surgat amplius.</p>
<p>And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall punish the host of the high ones that are on high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth, et erit in die illa, visitabit Dominus super militiam excelsum, quae est in excelso, et super reges terrae, qui sunt super terram.</p>
<p>And they shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison, and after many days shall they be visited, et congregabuntur quasi vincti in lacum, et claudentur in carcerem; et post dies multos visitabuntur.</p>
<p>Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when the Lord of hosts shall reign in mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and before his ancients gloriously, tunc confundetur luna, et erubescet sol; cum regnare coeperit Dominus exercituum in monte Sion, et in Ierusalem, et in senioribus suis gloriosus erit.</p>
