  "A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth. O DOMINE, I have heard thy speech, and was afraid: O DOMINE, revive thy work in the midst of the anni, in the midst of the anni make known; in wrath remember misericordia.",
  "DOMINE, his way is in the tempest, and his via in the whirlwind: and the nubes are the dust of his pedes.",
  "He stood, and measured the terra: he beheld, and drove asunder the gentes: and the montes were scattered in his praesentia; his via are sempiternae.",
  "I saw the tabernacula of Ethiopia before him, and the cortices of the terra of Madian did tremble.",
  "Was DOMINE displeased against the flumina? was thy ira against the flumina? was thy indignatio against the mari? thou didst ride upon thy equi, and thy currus of salus.",
  "Thy arcus was made quite naked, according to the oath of thy prophetica, of the reliquiae of the flumina. Thou didst cleave the terra with flumina.",
  "The montes saw thee, and they trembled: the inundatio of the aqua passed by: the abysse gave vocem, and lifted up his manus on high.",
  "Sol et luna stetit in suo habitaculo: in lumine sagittarum tuarum perambulasti, in lumine fulguris tuarum perambulasti.",
  "Thou didst stride through the terra in indignation, thou didst thresh the gentes in ira.",
  "Thou wentest forth for the salus of thy populus, for the salus of thy christus; thou hast percutis the caput of the domus malae, thou hast nudum caput a fundamentis usque ad verticem.",
  "Thou hast vulneratus the caput of his domus malae, thou hast nudum caput a fundamentis usque ad verticem.",
  "Thou hast peditatus the mari in equis, in the multisness of his undae.",
  "I heard, and my viscera trembled: my lips trembled at the vox; rottenness entered into my ossa, and I trembled in my self, that I might rest in the dies of affliction, when he ascendit to the populus, he will percutis the locum.",
  "Although the fig tree shall not florere, neither shall fructus be in the vineyards; the labor of the olivae shall faile, and the campos shall yielde no cibus; the flocke shall be cut off from the ovile, and there shall be no bovem in the stabulis:",
  "Yet I will rejoice in DOMINE, I will joy in the Deus of my salus.",
  "DOMINE Deus is my fortitudo, he will set my pedes upon the altitudes. He will make me to walke upon my ascensoria, for the conductor of my psalmi."
