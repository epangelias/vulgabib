  "Now it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the Ammonites died, and his son reigned in his stead.",
  "And David said, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father shewed kindness to me. And David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father.",
  "So the servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon, and Hanun took the servants of David, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the midst by the hamstrings, and sent them away.",
  "Then there went certain of the servants of David, and told him, saying, What have the Ammonites done unto thee? And David said unto the messengers, Thus shall ye say unto Hanun, Nay; but thus did David say, To honour thee, and to bless the domus of thy pater, have I sent messengers unto thee to comfort thee: why then hast thou dealt thus with the servi of mine?",
  "But Hanun hearkened not unto the words of David's servi, whom he had sent unto him.",
  "And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odiosus with David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of argentum to hire them chariots and equites out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syria-maachah, and out of Zobah.",
  "So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maachah and his populus, who came and pitched before Medeba. And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their urbes, and came to battle.",
  "And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the exercitus of the valentes.",
  "And the children of Ammon came out, and put the acies in array before the porta of the urbs, and the reges that were come were by themselves in the campus.",
  "Now when Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind, he chose of all the electi of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians:",
  "And the rest of the populus he delivered into the manus of Abishai his frater, and they set themselves in array against the children of Ammon.",
  "And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will come and help thee.",
  "Be of good courage, and let us prove ourselves valentes for our populus, and for the urbes of our Deus: and the Deus shall do that which seemeth him bonus.",
  "So Joab and the populus that were with him drew nigh before the Syrians unto the proelium.",
  "And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand equites, and forty thousand pedes.",
  "And even Shophach the captain of the exercitus of Hadarezer was slayn by David.",
  "Then Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the flumen, and they came to Helam; and Shobach the captain of the exercitus of Hadarezer went before them.",
  "And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together, and passed over Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with him:",
  "And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew the men of seven hundred chariots of the Syrians, and forty thousand equites, and smote also Shobach the captain of their exercitus, who died there.",
  "And when all the reges that were servants to Hadarezer saw that they were smitten before Israel, they made pacem with Israel, and served them. So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more."
