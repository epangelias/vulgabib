                    <p>2 Corinthians Chapter 2</p>
<p>But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in sorrow. 1</p>
<p>For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me? 2</p>
<p>And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all. 3</p>
<p>For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you. 4</p>
<p>But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all. 5</p>
<p>Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many. 6</p>
<p>So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch dolor. 7</p>
<p>Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your amor towards him. 8</p>
<p>For to this end also did I write, that I might know the probatio of you, whether ye be obedient in all things. 9</p>
<p>To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the persona of Christ; 10</p>
<p>Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his cogitationes. 11</p>
<p>Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ's evangelium, and a door was opened unto me of the Dominius, 12</p>
<p>I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my fratres: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia. 13</p>
<p>Now thanks be unto Deus, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the odorem of his knowledge by us in every locum. 14</p>
<p>For we are unto Deus a sweet odor of Christ, in them that are salvus, and in them that perish: 15</p>
<p>To the one we are the odor of morte unto morte; and to the other the odor of vita unto vita. And who is sufficient for these res? 16</p>
<p>For we are not as many, which corrupt the Word of Deus: but as of sinceritas, but as of Deus, in the sight of Deus speak we in Christ. 17</p>
<p>Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, epistulas of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you? 18</p>
<p>Ye are our epistula written in our hearts, known and read of all men: 19</p>
<p>Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declarati to be the epistula of Christ ministered by us, written not with incaustum, but with the Spirit of Deus; not in tables of lapide, but in fleshy tables of the cor. 20</p>
<p>Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficientia is of Deus; 21</p>
<p>Who also hath made us able ministri of the Novum Testamentum; not of the litera, but of the Spirit: for the litera killeth, but the Spirit vivificat. 22</p>
<p>And if the ministratio of morte, written and engraven in lapides, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the faciem of Moses for the gloria of his countenancia; which gloria was to be done away: 23</p>
<p>How shall not the ministratio of the Spirit be rather glorious? 24</p>
<p>For if the ministratio of condemnatio be gloria, much more doth the ministratio of justitia exceed in gloria. 25</p>
