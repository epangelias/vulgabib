                    <p>1 The preparations of the cor and the answer of the lingua are from hominem: but the Dominus weigheth the spirit.</p>
<p>2 All the via of a vir are clean in his own oculi; but the Dominus pondereth the corda.</p>
<p>3 Commit thy works unto the Dominus, and thy cogitationes shall be established.</p>
<p>4 The Dominus hath made omnia for Himself: yea, even the impius for the dies malus.</p>
<p>5 Every one that is superbus in cor is abomination unto the Dominus: though hand join in hand, he shall not be innocent.</p>
<p>6 By misericordia and veritas iniquitas shall be expiated: and by the timor of the Dominus men depart from malum.</p>
<p>7 When a vir's via pleaseth the Dominus, He maketh even his inimici to be at pacem with him.</p>
<p>8 Better is a little with iustitia, than great revenues without iustitia.</p>
<p>9 A vir's cor deviseth his via: but the Dominus directeth his gressus.</p>
<p>10 A divinatio is in the labia of the rex: his os shall not err in iudicium.</p>
<p>11 A iusta pondus and balance are the Dominus': all the pondera of the sacculus are His work.</p>
<p>12 It is abomination to rex to commit iniquitas: for the thronus is established by iustitia.</p>
<p>13 Iustitia lips are the delight of rex: and he loveth him that speaketh recta.</p>
<p>14 The indignatio of a rex is as messengers of morte: but a vir sapiens will pacify it.</p>
<p>15 In the lumen of the rex's facies is vita: and his favour is as a nimbos after the caligo.</p>
<p>16 How much better is it to get sapientia than aurum! and to get prudentia rather to be electus than argentum!</p>
<p>17 The via of the iustus is to depart from malum: he that keepeth his anima shall be wise.</p>
<p>18 Before destruction a vir's cor is exaltatus; and before honour is humilitas.</p>
<p>19 Better it is to be patient in spirit: than a vir that is exaltatus in animus.</p>
<p>20 He that handleth a matter wisely shall find bona: and whoso trusteth in the Dominus, happy is he.</p>
<p>21 The sapientia in cor of a vir is called prudentia: and the sweetness of labia increaseth doctrinam.</p>
<p>22 Understanding is a fons of vita to him that hath it: but the disciplina of fools is folly.</p>
<p>23 The cor of the sapiens teacheth his os, and addeth doctrinam to his labia.</p>
<p>24 Pleasant words are as a mel: sweet to the anima, and health to the os.</p>
<p>25 There is a via that seemeth rectus unto a vir, but the exitus thereof are the viae mortis.</p>
<p>26 The anima of the laborantis laboureth for him: for his os oppresseth him.</p>
<p>27 A hypocrita with his os destroyeth his amicum: but the iustus delivereth them.</p>
<p>28 The violentus man sows discord: and a whisperer separateth chief amicos.</p>
<p>29 A violentus man enticeth his amicum, and leadeth him into the viae malae.</p>
<p>30 He shutteth his oculi to devise subtilitas: he biteth his labia to perform it.</p>
<p>31 The hoary caput is a corona of gloria, if it be found in the via iustitiae.</p>
<p>32 He that is slow to ira is better than the potens; and he that ruleth his spirit, than he that taketh a civitas.</p>
<p>33 The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole dispositio thereof is of the Dominus.</p>
