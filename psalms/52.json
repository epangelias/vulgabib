  "1. Why doth thine Amicitia boast itself, thou mighty Deus, thy Salus also, every day?",
  "2. He deviseth mischief in his Cor, he soweth Zelus, and reapeth Fraus.",
  "3. His lingua is as a sharp Gladius, thou lovest malitia, and destruens thou.",
  "4. Thou lovest omnem veritatem to speak wickedness, thou tongue deceitful, they destroye, et linguam Dolosi.",
  "5. Deus shall likewise destroye thee for ever, he shall take thee away, and pluck thee out of the Tabernaculum, and roote thee out of the terra of the Viventes.",
  "6. The iusti also shall see, and feare, and shall laugh at him, saying,",
  "7. Lo, this is the Homo, that made not Deus his refugium; but trusted in the Multitudo of his Divitiae, and strengthened himself in his malitia.",
  "8. But I am like an olive tree Floridus in the domus of Deus: I have trusted in the Misericordia of Deus for ever, and ever.",
  "9. I will praise thee for ever, because thou hast done it: and I will wait on thy Nomen, for it is Bonum before thy Sancti."
