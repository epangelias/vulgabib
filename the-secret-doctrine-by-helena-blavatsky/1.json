  "There was no possible doubt whatever that the Secret Doctrine was the Upanishads, and the Upanishads were the Secret Doctrine.",
  "The writer of the present volumes has been sent to prove this identity, and to show that, by the study of the Upanishads, a new light can be thrown upon the mysteries of the Christian Bible.",
  "It is not in the reading of the Upanishads alone that the student will find the Secret Doctrine, for the same truths are to be found in the Kabala, in the Talmud, in the writings of the Gnostics, and in the fragments of the ancient philosophies.",
  "It is in the Secret Doctrine that the student will find the key to the mysteries of Nature, and the explanation of the phenomena of the universe.",
  "The present work is an attempt to place the Secret Doctrine on a scientific basis, and to show that it is the foundation of all the ancient wisdom."
