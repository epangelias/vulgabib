                    <p>O Deus, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even with my glory.</p>
<p>Awake, psaltery and harp; I myself will awake early, aurora.</p>
<p>I will praise thee, O Deus, among the gentes; I will sing unto thee among the nations.</p>
<p>For thy misericordia is magnus above the coelum; thy veritas reacheth unto the nubes.</p>
<p>Be thou exalted, O Deus, above the coelum; and thy gloria above all terra;</p>
<p>That thy dilectus may be delivered; save with thy right manus, and answer me.</p>
<p>Deus hath spoken in his sanctuario; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the vallis of Succoth.</p>
<p>Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the fortitudo of my caput; Judah is my legislator;</p>
<p>Moab is my lavacrum; over Edom will I cast my calceus; Philistia, be thou glad of me.</p>
<p>Who will bring me into the civitas of munitio, who will lead me into Edom?</p>
<p>Wilt not thou, O Deus, who hast cast us off? and wilt not thou, O Deus, go forth with our exercitus?</p>
<p>Give us help from trouble; for vana is the salvus of man.</p>
<p>Through Deus we shall do valiantly; for he it is that shall calcat our inimicus.</p>
