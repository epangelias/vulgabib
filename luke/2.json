  "And it came to pass in those dies, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed.",
  "And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.",
  "And all went to be taxed, every one into his own civitas.",
  "And Joseph also went up from Galilaea, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; because he was of the house and lineage of David:",
  "To be taxed with Maria his uxor, who was with child.",
  "And so it was, that, while they were there, the dies were accomplished that she should be delivered.",
  "And she brought forth her primogenitus son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a praesepe; because there was no room for them in the hospitium.",
  "And there were in the same region pastores abiding in the field, keeping watch over their greges by night.",
  "And, lo, the angelus of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.",
  "And the angelus said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you tidings of great gaudium, which shall be to all people.",
  "For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Salvator, which is Christus the Lord.",
  "And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a praesepe.",
  "And suddenly there was with the angelus a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,",
  "Gloria in altissimis Deo, and on earth pax, good will toward men.",
  "And it came to pass, as the angelus were gone away from them into caelum, the pastores said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us.",
  "And they came with haste, and found Maria, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a praesepe.",
  "And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child.",
  "And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the pastores.",
  "But Maria kept all these things, and pondered them in her cor.",
  "And the pastores returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them.",
  "And when eight dies were accomplished for the circumcisio of the child, his nomen was called JESUS, which was so named of the angelus before he was conceived in the uterus.",
  "And when the dies of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord;",
  "As it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that openeth the vulva shall be called holy to the Lord;",
  "And to offer a sacrificium according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.",
  "And, behold, there was a homo in Jerusalem, whose nomen was Simeon; and the same homo was justus and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Spirit was upon him.",
  "And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Spirit, that he should not see mors by death, before he had seen the Christus of the Lord.",
  "And he came by the Spirit into the templum: and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law,",
  "Then took he him up in his brachia, and blessed God, and said,",
  "Lord, now lettest thou thy servus depart in pax, according to thy word:",
  "For mine oculi have seen thy salvus;",
  "Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people;",
  "A lumen to lighten the gentes, and the gloria of thy people Israel.",
  "And Joseph and his mater marveled at those things which were spoken of the child.",
  "And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Maria his mater, Behold, this child is set for the ruin and resurrection of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against;",
  "Yea, a gladius shall pierce through thy own animus also, that the cogitationes of many cor may be revealed.",
  "And there was one Anna, a prophetissa, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with her vir, seven years from her virginitas;",
  "And she was a vidua of about fourscore and four years, which departed not from the templum, but served God with fastings and orationes night and day.",
  "And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem.",
  "And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilaea, to their own city Nazareth.",
  "And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with sapientia: and the gratia of God was upon him."
