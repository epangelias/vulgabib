  "O Domine, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the terra!",
  "Out of the mouth of infantes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.",
  "When I consider the caelum, the work of thy fingers, the lunam and the stellae, which thou hast ordained;",
  "What is homo, that thou art mindful of him? and the filius hominis, that thou visitest him?",
  "For thou hast made him a little lower than the angelos, and hast crowned him with gloria and honorem.",
  "Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy manus: thou hast put all things under his pedes:",
  "Ovine and all beastes of the terra, also the volucres of the caelum, and the pisces of the mare;",
  "O Domine, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the terra!"
