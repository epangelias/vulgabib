  "The people that walked in darkness have seen a great lux, they that dwell in the land of the shadow of mors, upon them hath the lux shined.",
  "Thou hast multiplied the nation, and not increased their gaudium: they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest, and as men rejoice when they dividunt spolia.",
  "For thou hast broken the yoke of his onus, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, as in the day of Midian.",
  "For every caliga of the luctator, and the vesture rolled in sanguine shall be burned for consumption, fuel for the ignis.",
  "For unto us a puer is born, unto us a filius is given: and the principatus shall be upon his shoulder: and his nomen shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, Deus, the Mighty, the Father of the Aevum, the Prince of Pax.",
  "Of the increase of his imperium and pax there shall be no finis, upon the thronus of David, and upon his regnum, to order it, and to stablish it with justitia and with justitia from henceforth even for ever.",
  "The zelus of the Lord of hosts will perform this.",
  "The Lord sent a verbum into Jacob, and it hath lighted upon Israel.",
  "And all the populus shall know, even Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria, that say in the pride and stoutness of cor: ",
  "The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with lapides quadrati: the sycomores are cut down, but we will change them into cedri.",
  "Therefore the Lord shall set up the enemies of Rezin against him, and join his enemies together,",
  "The Syrians before, and the Philistines behind; and they shall devour Israel with open os.",
  "Yet for all this his ira is not turned away, but his manus is stretched out still.",
  "For the populus turneth not unto him that smiteth them, neither do they seek the Lord of hosts.",
  "Therefore the Lord will cut off from Israel head and tail, branch and rush, in one day.",
  "The elder and honourable, he is the head; and the prophet that teacheth lies, he is the tail.",
  "For the leaders of this populus cause them to err; and they that are led of them are destroyed.",
  "Therefore the Lord shall have no delectatio in their juvenes, neither shall he have misericordia on their orphanos: for every one is hypocrita and malicious, and every os speaketh folly.",
  "For all this his ira is not turned away, but his manus is stretched out still.",
  "For wickedness burneth as ignis: it shall devour the spina, and the vepres, and shall consume the radices of the montes.",
  "The Lord shall have no delectatio in them, but shall destroy them, and turn them over into manus of his enemies, if they shall not make petition to his nomine.",
  "From the foundation of the orbis they have not heard, nor perceived with aures, nor seen with oculi, nor understood with cor.",
  "Who hath formed a deus, or molten a simulacrum to himself, that he may get pretium of it?",
  "Know ye not? have ye not heard? hath it not been told you from the principio of the orbis? have ye not understood from the foundations of the terra?",
  "He that sitteth upon the globus of the terra, and the inhabitants thereof are as locustae: he stretcheth out the caelum as a pallium, and spreadeth them out as a tabernaculum to dwell in:",
  "That bringeth the principes to nothing; he maketh the judices of the terra as vanity.",
  "Scarce shall they be planted, scarce shall they be sown, scarce shall their radix be fixed in the terra: and he shall also blow upon them, and they shall wither, and the whirlwind shall take them away as stipulam.",
  "Now to whom will ye liken me, or shall I be equal? saith the Sanctus.",
  "Lift up your oculi on high, and behold who hath created these things, that bringeth out their host by numero; he calleth them all by nomen by the magnitudo of his virtus, and for that he is strong in potentia not one faileth.",
  "Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, My via is hid from the Lord, and my judicium is passed over from my Deus?",
  "Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that the Deus sempiternus, the Lord, the Creator of the fines of the terra, fainteth not, neither is weary? there is no investigatio of his intellectus.",
  "He giveth potentia to the lassus, and to them that have no virtus he increaseth fortitudinem.",
  "Even the juvenes shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall:",
  "But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their fortitudo; they shall ascend by alis as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint."
