                    <p>O Lord, rebuke me not in thy ira, neither chasten me in thy furor.</p>
<p>For thine sagittae stick fast in me, and thy manus presseth me sore.</p>
<p>There is no sana caro in my carne; for the sake of thy indignatio.</p>
<p>My peccata have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the capilli of mine head; therefore my cor heart faileth me.</p>
<p>Lord, all my desiderium is before thee; and my gemitus is not hid from thee.</p>
<p>My cor is troubled; my virtus hath left me; and the lux of mine oculi, it is gone from me.</p>
<p>My amici and my socii stand aloof from my plaga; and my propinqui stand far off.</p>
<p>They also that require my anima lay snares for me; and they that seek my malum speak mischievous things, and imagine fraudes all the die.</p>
<p>But I, as a surdus, heard not; and I was as a mutus that openeth not his os.</p>
<p>Thus I was as a homo that heareth not, and in whose os are no reprehensiones.</p>
<p>For in thee, O Lord, do I sperare; thou wilt avertere my face from my inimici.</p>
<p>Hear my oratio, O Lord, and attend to my petitio; hearken unto me, for thy misericordia is bonus.</p>
<p>Turn not away thy facies from thy servus; for I am in angustia; hear me speedily.</p>
<p>Draw nigh unto my anima, and redime me; salva me propter inimicos meos.</p>
<p>They that seek my anima, to destroy it, shall go into the infernus.</p>
<p>They shall fall by the gladius; they shall be a partitio for foxes.</p>
<p>But the rex shall rejoice in Deo; every one that iurat by him shall gloriari; for the os of those that speak mendacium shall be stopped.</p>
