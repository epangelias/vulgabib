                    <p>To the chief Musician, upon Shushaneduth, Michtam of David, to teach; when he strove with Aramnaharaim and with Aramzobah, and Joab returned, and smote of Edom in the valley of salt twelve thousand. O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast scattered us, thou hast been displeased; O turn thyself to us again.</p>
<p>Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast broken it: heal the breaches thereof; for it shaketh. Thou hast shewed thy people hard things: thou hast made us to drink the wine of astonishment.</p>
<p>Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah. That thy beloved may be delivered; save with thy right hand, and hear me.</p>
<p>God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.</p>
<p>Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver;</p>
<p>Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia, triumph thou because of me.</p>
<p>Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?</p>
<p>Wilt not thou, O God, which hadst cast us off? and thou, O God, which didst not go out with our armies?</p>
<p>Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.</p>
<p>Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread down our adversaries.</p>
