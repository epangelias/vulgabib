  "And the word of the Dominus came unto me, saying,",
  "Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy, and say thou unto them that prophesy out of their own cor, Hear ye the word of the Dominus;",
  "Thus saith the Dominus Deus; Woe unto the foolish prophets, that follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!",
  "O Israel, thy prophets are like the vulpes in the deserts.",
  "Ye have not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge for the domus of Israel to stand in the battalia in the day of the Dominus.",
  "They have seen vanity and lying divination, saying, The Dominus saith: and the Dominus hath not sent them: and they have made others to hope that they would confirm the word.",
  "Have ye not seen a vain vision, and have ye not spoken a lying divination, whereas ye say, The Dominus saith it; albeit I have not spoken?",
  "Therefore thus saith the Dominus Deus; Because ye have spoken vanity, and seen lies, therefore, behold, I am against you, saith the Dominus Deus.",
  "And mine hand shall be upon the prophets that see vanity, and that divine lies: they shall not be in the assembly of my people, neither shall they be written in the writing of the domus of Israel, neither shall they enter into the terra of Israel; and ye shall know that I am the Dominus Deus.",
  "Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, Pax; and there was no pax; and one built up a wall, and, lo, others daubed it with untempered motus;",
  "Say unto them which daub it with untempered motus, that it shall fall: there shall be an overflowing pluviâ; and ye, O great hailstones, shall fall; and a ventus of tempest shall rend it.",
  "Lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said unto you, Where is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed it?",
  "Therefore thus saith the Dominus Deus; I will even rend it with a tempestuous ventus in my indignation, and there shall be an overflowing pluviâ in mine anger, and great hailstones in my fury to consume it.",
  "So will I break down the wall that ye have daubed with untempered motus, and bring it down to the terra, that the fundamentum thereof may appear, and it shall fall, and ye shall be consumed in the midst thereof: and ye shall know that I am the Dominus.",
  "Thus will I accomplish my indignation upon the wall, and upon them that have daubed it with untempered motus, and will say unto you, The wall is no more, neither they that daubed it;",
  "To wit, the prophets of Israel which prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and which see visions of pax for her, and there is no pax, saith the Dominus Deus.",
  "Likewise, thou son of man, set thy face against the filiae of thy people, which prophesy out of their own cor; prophesy thou also against them,",
  "And say, Thus saith the Dominus Deus; Woe to the women that sew pillows to all armholes, and make kerchiefs upon the head of every stature to hunt souls! Will ye hunt the souls of my people, and will ye save the souls alive that come unto you?",
  "And will ye pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of panis, to slay the souls that should not die, and to save the souls alive that should not live, by your lying to my people that hear your lies?",
  "Behold, I am against your pillows, wherewith ye there hunt the souls to make them fly, and I will tear them from your armholes, and will let the souls go, even the souls that ye hunt to make them fly.",
  "Your kerchiefs also will I tear, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted; and ye shall know that I am the Dominus Deus.",
  "Because with lies ye have made the cor of the righteous sad, whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, by promising him life:",
  "Therefore ye shall see no more vanity, nor divine divinations: for I will deliver my people out of your hand: and ye shall know that I am the Dominus Deus."
