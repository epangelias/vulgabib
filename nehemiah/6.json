  "Now it came to pass, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the Arab, and the rest of our adversaries, heard that I had builded the murus, and that there was no porta left therein; (the portae were yet in the limus,)",
  "That Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in the vallis of Ono. But they thought to do me malum.",
  "And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a magnum opus, so that I cannot come down: why should the opus cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?",
  "Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.",
  "Then sent Sanballat his servus unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open epistula in his manus;",
  "In it was written, It is reported among the gentes, and Gashmu saith it, that thou and the Iudaei think to rebellare: for which cause thou buildest the murus, that thou mayest be their rex, according to these words:",
  "And thou hast also appointed prophetas to preach of thee at Hierusalem, saying, There is a rex in Iudaea: and now shall it be reported to the rex according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take consilium together.",
  "Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such res as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thy cor.",
  "For they all made us afraid, saying, Their manus shall be weakened from the opus, that it be not done. Now therefore, O Deus, confirm my manus.",
  "Afterward I came unto the domus of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the domus of Deus, within the templum, and let us shut the portae of the templum: for they will come to occidere thee; yea, in the nocte they will come to occidere thee.",
  "And I said, Should such a vir as I flee? and who is there, that, being as I am, would go into the templum to save his anima? I will not go in.",
  "And, lo, I perceived that Deus had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophetia against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.",
  "Therefore was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for malum, and that they might reproach me.",
  "My Deus, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their res, and on the prophetissa Noadiah, and the rest of the prophetas, that would have put me in timor.",
  "So the murus was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty and two dies.",
  "And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard thereof, and all the gentes that were about us saw these things, they were much cast down in their own oculus, and they perceived that this opus was wrought of our Deus."
