                    <p>Elihu spake moreover, and said, 'Audientia mea est apud sapientes, et scientia mea testificabitur in me.'</p>
<p>Hear my words, O ye sapientes; for I have voluntas to justify the justus, and my lips shall speak scientia.</p>
<p>My cor shall utter veritas; and wickedness is an abomination to my lips.</p>
<p>The Spiritus of Deus hath made me, and the breath of Omnipotens hath given me vita.</p>
<p>If thou hast potestas to answer me, prepare thyself, and stand before me.</p>
<p>Behold, I am according to thy wish in loco Dei; I also am formatus of limus.</p>
<p>Behold, my terror shall not make thee flee, neither shall my manus be heavy upon thee.</p>
<p>Surely thou hast spoken in mea aures, and I have audied the vocem of thy sermones, saying,</p>
<p>I am purus, without peccatum; I am innocent; neither is there iniquitas in me.</p>
<p>Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his inimicus,</p>
<p>He putteth my pedes in gyves; he marketh all my via.</p>
<p>Lo, in this thou art not justus; I will answer thee, that Deus is greater than homo.</p>
<p>Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not responsio to any of his sermones.</p>
<p>For Deus speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not.</p>
<p>In somnium, in visione nocturna, when somnus fallet upon homines, and they are in sopore upon lectus,</p>
<p>Then he openeth the aures of homines, and sealeth their instructio,</p>
<p>That he may withdraw homo from his actio, and hide pride from homo.</p>
<p>He keepeth back his anima from corruption, and his vita from perdition.</p>
<p>He is chastised also with dolore upon his lectus, and the multitude of his ossa with strong febris:</p>
<p>So that his vita abhorreth panem, and his anima cibum delicatum.</p>
<p>His caro is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his ossa that were not seen stick out.</p>
<p>Yea, his anima draweth near to corruption, and his vita to mortem.</p>
<p>If there be an angelus cum him, an interpres, one among a thousand, to shew unto homo his rectus via,</p>
<p>He is gracious unto him, and saith, 'Deliver him from descending to sepulchrum; I have found a redemptio.'</p>
<p>His caro shall be fresher than puer, he shall return to dies of his iuventus:</p>
<p>He shall pray unto Deus, and he will be favourable unto him; and he shall see his faciem with iubilatio; for he rendereth unto homo his iustitia.</p>
<p>He looketh upon homines, and if any say, 'I have peccatum, and perverted that which was rectus; and it profiteth me not;</p>
<p>He will deliver his anima from corruption, and his vita shall see lumen.'</p>
<p>Lo, all these things worketh Deus oftentimes with homo,</p>
<p>To bring back his anima from corruption, and to light him with lumen of vita.</p>
