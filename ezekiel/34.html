                    <p>1 And the word of the Dominus came unto me, saying,</p>
<p>2 Son of man, prophesy against the pastores of Israel, prophesy, and say unto them, Thus saith the Dominus Deus; Woe be to the pastores of Israel that do feed themselves! should not the pastores feed the flocks?</p>
<p>3 Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye slay the fatlings; but ye feed not the flock.</p>
<p>4 The weak have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye bound up that which was broken, neither have ye brought again that which was driven away, neither have ye sought that which was lost; but with force and with cruelty have ye ruled them.</p>
<p>5 And they were scattered, because there is no pastor: and they became meat to all the beasts of the field, when they were scattered.</p>
<p>6 My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every high hill: yea, my sheep were scattered upon all the face of the earth, and none did search or seek after them.</p>
<p>7 Therefore, ye pastores, hear the word of the Dominus;</p>
<p>8 As I live, saith the Dominus Deus, surely because my flock became a prey, and my flock became meat to every beast of the field, because there was no pastor, neither could my pastores search for my flock, but the pastores fed themselves, and fed not my flock;</p>
<p>9 Therefore, O ye pastores, hear the word of the Dominus;</p>
<p>10 Thus saith the Dominus Deus; Behold, I am against the pastores; and I will require my flock at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the flock; neither shall the pastores feed themselves any more; for I will deliver my flock from their mouth, that they may not be meat for them.</p>
<p>11 For thus saith the Dominus Deus; Behold, I, even I, will both search my sheep, and seek them out.</p>
<p>12 As a pastor seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered; so will I seek out my sheep, and will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day.</p>
<p>13 And I will bring them out from the people, and gather them from the countries, and will bring them to their own land, and feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the rivers, and in all the inhabited places of the country.</p>
<p>14 I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be: there shall they lie in a good fold, and in a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel.</p>
<p>15 I will feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down, saith the Dominus Deus.</p>
<p>16 I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick: but I will destroy the fat and the strong; I will feed them with judgment.</p>
<p>17 And as for you, O my flock, thus saith the Dominus Deus; Behold, I judge between cattle and cattle, between the rams and the he goats.</p>
<p>18 Seemeth it a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good pasture, but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures? and to have drunk of the deep waters, but ye must foul the residue with your feet?</p>
<p>19 And as for my flock, they eat that which ye have trodden with your feet; and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feet.</p>
<p>20 Therefore thus saith the Dominus Deus unto them; Behold, I, even I, will judge between the fat cattle and between the lean cattle.</p>
<p>21 Because ye have thrust with side and with shoulder, and pushed all the diseased with your horns, till ye have scattered them abroad;</p>
<p>22 Therefore will I save my flock, and they shall no more be a prey; and I will judge between cattle and cattle.</p>
<p>23 And I will set up one pastor over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their pastor.</p>
<p>24 And I the Dominus will be their Deus, and my servant David a prince among them; I the Dominus have spoken it.</p>
<p>25 And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land: and they shall dwell safely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods.</p>
<p>26 And I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in his season; there shall be showers of blessing.</p>
<p>27 And the tree of the field shall yield her fruit, and the earth shall yield her increase, and they shall be safe in their land, and shall know that I am the Dominus, when I have broken the bands of their yoke, and delivered them out of the hand of those that served themselves of them.</p>
<p>28 And they shall no more be a prey to the heathen, neither shall the beast of the land devour them; but they shall dwell safely, and none shall make them afraid.</p>
<p>29 And I will raise up for them a plant of renown, and they shall be no more consumed with hunger in the land, neither bear the shame of the heathen any more.</p>
<p>30 Thus shall they know that I the Dominus their Deus am with them, and that they, even the house of Israel, are my people, saith the Dominus Deus.</p>
<p>31 And ye my flock, the flock of my pasture, are men, and I am your Deus, saith the Dominus Deus.</p>
