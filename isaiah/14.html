                    <p>How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of populus! she is become as a vidua, weeping sorely in the noctis, and her amici have forsaken her.</p>
<p>Judicia is turned away backward, and justitia standeth afar off: for veritas is fallen in the platea, and aequitas could not enter.</p>
<p>And he shall destroy in this mountain the faciem of the vinculum, and the velamen that covereth all populorum, and the velum that covereth all gentium.</p>
<p>And in that dies the Lord shall visit in gladio the exercitus of the coelestis, and the reges of the terra upon the terra.</p>
<p>And it shall be in that dies, saith the Lord, I shall visit upon the astrum of the coelestis, and upon the reges of the terra upon the terra.</p>
<p>And the terra shall be desolata under the inhabitants thereof; because they have transgressed the leges, changed the iudicia, and broken the foedus sempiternum.</p>
<p>Therefore hath the maledictio devorata the terra, and they that inhabitant in it shall be desolati: therefore the inhabitants of the terra shall be ignis, and few homines shall be left.</p>
<p>The nova luna shall be as sanguis, and the lumina of the coelestis shall not be lucidus.</p>
<p>And the Lord shall give vocem as a lea, as when he descended to pugnare in the mons Perazim, and to dividere the silvam of the camporum.</p>
<p>And in that dies the radix Iesse, qui stabit in signum populorum, shall be desiderabilis; gentes deprecabuntur eum, and honos ejus in terra viventium.</p>
<p>And it shall come to pass in that dies, that the Lord shall spoliabit the exercitus of the coelestis, and the reges of the terra upon the terra.</p>
<p>And they shall be gathered together as in a carcer, and shall be clausi in ergastulum, and after many dies shall be visitati.</p>
<p>And the luna shall blush, and the sol shall confundetur, quia dominus exercituum regnabit in monte Sion, et in Ierusalem, et in conspectu senum suorum in gloria.</p>
<p>And the Lord shall create super every locum in monte Sion, and super tabernacula in it, a nubem per diem, and a fumus, et splendor ignis flammantis per noctes: quia super omnem gloria protegetur.</p>
<p>And shall be a tabernaculum for umbra from calor, and for refugium from turbo, et pluviis: quia dominus exercituum cum gloria proteget super eos.</p>
