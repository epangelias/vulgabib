                    <p>And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the septem seals, and I heard, as it were the vox of thunder, one of the quattuor beasts saying, Come and see.</p>
<p>And I saw, and behold a white equus; and he that sat on him had a bow; and a corona was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.</p>
<p>And when he had opened the secundus seal, I heard the secundus beast say, Come and see.</p>
<p>And there went out another equus that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take pax from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great gladius.</p>
<p>And when he had opened the tertius seal, I heard the tertius beast say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black equus; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand.</p>
<p>And I heard a vox in the midst of the quattuor beasts say, A measure of wheat for a denarius, and three measures of barley for a denarius; and see thou hurt not the oleum and the vinum.</p>
<p>And when he had opened the quartus seal, I heard the vox of the quartus beast say, Come and see.</p>
<p>And I looked, and behold a pale equus: and his name that sat on him was Mors, and Hades followed with him. And power was given unto them over the quartus part of the terra, to kill with sword, and with famine, and with death, and with the beasts of the terra.</p>
