  "The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in veritas, and not I only, but also all they that have known the veritas;",
  "Because of the veritas which abideth in us, and shall be with us for ever.",
  "Grace be with you, mercy, and pax, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in veritas and caritas.",
  "I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in veritas, as we have received a mandatum from the Father.",
  "And now I beseech thee, lady, not as writing a new mandatum unto thee, but that which we had from the principio, that we love one another.",
  "And this is the love, that we walk after his mandata. This is the mandatum, That, as ye have heard from the principio, ye should walk in it.",
  "For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in carne: this is a deceiver and an antichrist.",
  "Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.",
  "Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrina of Christ, hath not Deus: he that abideth in the doctrina of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.",
  "If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrina, receive him not into your domus, neither bid him Ave.",
  "For he that biddeth him Ave is partaker of his malum deeds.",
  "Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our gaudeo may be full.",
  "The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen."
