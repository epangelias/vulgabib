                    <p>There are two ways, one of life and one of death, and there is a great difference between the two ways.</p>
<p>The way of life, then, is this: First, thou shalt love God who made thee; second, thy neighbour as thyself; and all things whatsoever thou wouldst not have befal thee, do them not to another.</p>
<p>But the way of death is this: First, it is evil and full of a curse, murders, adulteries, lusts, fornications, thefts, idolatries, magic arts, witchcrafts, rivalries, strife, jealousy, wrath, factions, dissensions, heresies, envyings, drunkenness, carousings, and other things like these.</p>
<p>If any one can render a greater service, he is worthy of double honour, especially if he is innocent; for he that speaketh, serveth not himself, but him that speaketh to him.</p>
<p>But he that hath the word of knowledge, let him speak to the edification of the hearer, that he that receiveth the word may be edified thereby.</p>
<p>Blessed is he that speaketh the word of the Lord; for he that speaketh, receiveth it; but he that heareth, doth not receive it, unless he speak in the Spirit.</p>
<p>But the speaker in the Spirit searcheth all things, even the deep things of God.</p>
