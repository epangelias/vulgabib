                    <p>The secret account of the revelation that Jesus spoke in conversation with Judas Iscariot during a week, three days before He celebrated Passover.</p>
<p>I, Judas, was with them from the beginning. I have walked alongside the others, but I alone have truly understood the mysteries of the kingdom.</p>
<p>When Jesus appeared on earth, he performed miracles and great wonders for the salvation of humanity.</p>
<p>And the scribes and the Pharisees and the priests were offended by his wisdom and his teaching, for he did not observe the law.</p>
<p>But I, Judas, knew that the law was for the sake of mankind, and that the sacrifices which they offered to God were not pleasing to him, for they did not possess the spirit.</p>
<p>And I, Judas, I alone, knew the truth, for I was entrusted with the mystery of the kingdom, and I was the one who knew that the sacrifices of the priests were not pleasing to God.</p>
