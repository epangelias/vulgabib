                    <p> Honour thy father and mother; which is the first commandment with promise;</p>
<p>that it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the terra.</p>
<p>If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome verba, even to the doctrine of our Dominus Iesus Christ,</p>
<p>and to the doctrine which is according to pietas;</p>
<p>He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of verba, whereof cometh envies, strife, railings, and malicious whispers;</p>
<p>perverse disputings of men corrupt in mind, and destitute of the veritas, supposing that pietas is lucre:</p>
<p>from such withdraw thyself.</p>
<p>But godliness with contentment is great lucre.</p>
<p>For we brought nothing into this mundus, and it is manifest that we can carry nothing out;</p>
<p>but having victus and vestitus, let us therewith be content.</p>
<p>For they that will be rich fall into tentation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful cupiditates, which drown men in destruction and perditio.</p>
<p>For radix of all malum is cupiditas, which while some coveted after, they have erred from the fides, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows;</p>
<p>but thou, O man of Deus, flee these things; and follow after iustitia, pietas, fides, amor, and pacem, with them that call on the nomine of the Dominus from a pure cor.</p>
<p>But refuse profane and old wives' fabulas, and exercise thyself rather unto pietas;</p>
<p>for bodily exercitation profiteth little: but pietas is profitable unto all things, having promissio of the vita that now is, and of that which is to come.</p>
<p>This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.</p>
<p>That we labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living Deus, who is the Salvator of all men, especially of those that believe.</p>
<p>These things command and teach.</p>
<p>Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an exemplum of the believers, in word, in conversation, in caritas, in spirit, in fides, in puritas.</p>
<p> Till I come, give attendance to lectura, to exhortation, to doctrine.</p>
<p>Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophetia, with the laying on of the hands of the presbyterium.</p>
<p>Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profectus may appear to all.</p>
<p>Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.</p>
