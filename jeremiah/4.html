                    <p>1. How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of populus? she is become as a vidua, she that was great among the gentes: she that was princess among the provinciae, how is she become tributaria!</p>
<p>2. She weepeth sore in the nocte, and her lacrimae are on her cheeks: among all her amatores she hath none to comfort her: all her amici have dealt deceitfully with her, they are become her inimici.</p>
<p>3. Iudaea is gone into captivitas because of affliction, and because of multus labor: she dwelleth among the gentes, she findeth no requies: all her persecutores have taken her in medio afflictionis.</p>
<p>4. The viae of Sion mourn, because none come to the solemnis: all her portae are desolate: her sacerdotes sigh, her virgines are in afflictione, and she is in amaritudine.</p>
<p>5. Her inimici are become her domini, her hostes prosper; for the Lord hath afflictam her for the multus peccata: her parvuli are gone into captivitas before the face of persecutor.</p>
<p>6. And from the filia of Sion all her decorus is departed: her principes are become like cervi that find no pascua, and they are gone without fortitudo before the face of persecutor.</p>
<p>7. Ierusalem hath recollectum the dies of her affliction and her amaritudines, and all the desiderabilia that she had from the dies of antiqua: when her populus ceciderit in manu of the inimicus, and there was none to help her: the inimici viderunt her, and they have derisum her sabbata.</p>
<p>8. Ierusalem peccavit grievously: therefore she is become sordida: all that honored her, despise her, because they have viderunt her ignominiam: yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward.</p>
<p>9. Her sordidus was polluta in her vestimentis, and she hath not recollectum her finem: therefore her subversio is made mirabilis: there is none to comfort her. O Lord, vide afflictionem meam: for the inimicus hath magnificatus.</p>
<p>10. The inimicus hath stretch out his manum upon all her desiderabilia: for she hath viderunt the gentes entering into her sanctuarium, whom thou hast commanded that they should not enter into thy coetus.</p>
<p>11. All her populus sigh, they seek panem: they have given their desiderabilia for cibus to restore animam: vide, O Lord, and consider; for I am become vilis.</p>
<p>12. O all ye that ambulate by the via, vide and cognoscite, if there be dolor like my dolor, which is done to me, wherewith the Lord hath afflictam me in the dies of furor his irae.</p>
<p>13. From above he hath sent ignem into my ossa, and it hath dominatus: he hath stretched out a rete for my pedes, he hath turned me back: me he hath made desolatam and languere tota die.</p>
<p>14. The yoke of my peccata is bound by his manus: they are twist together in manu eius, and they are put upon my cervix: me he hath made languere: me the Lord hath delivered into manus, out of which I am not able to rise up.</p>
<p>15. The Lord hath prostratus all my fortes in medio me, he hath called coetum against me, to break my iuvenes: the Lord hath calcat the virginiem, the pulchritudo of Israel.</p>
<p>16. He hath also builded his tugurium in medio me, that he might prepare his tent against me: he hath set his faciem against me, and he hath given me dolor, he hath compassed me round about with amaritudo and labore.</p>
<p>17. And I have cryed out for help, but there was none to me: I have cryed out to the domini, but they have deceptum me.</p>
<p>18. Their vox is gone from me, as aqua that falleth in aream: they have given me panem amarum, and they have given me potum fel in cibo.</p>
<p>19. Behold, O Lord, for I am in angustia: my cor is turned within me, my parvuli and my virgines are gone into captivitas.</p>
<p>20. I have called for my amici, but they have deceptum me: my sacerdotes and my anciani are languidi in civitate, while they sought cibus to restore animam.</p>
<p>21. Hear, I pray thee, O Ierusalem, for I am in dolore: my cor is turned within me, for I am full of indignatio: for the Lord hath spoken against me, saying, I will scatter thee among the gentes, and thou shalt be desolata.</p>
<p>22. Ierusalem, Ierusalem, that slayest the prophetas, and stonest them that are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy parvuli together, as a gallina gathereth her pullos under her alas, and ye would not?</p>
<p>23. O generation, vide the Word of the Lord. Have I been a desertum unto Israel? or a terra of tenebrae? why doth my populus say, We are liber, and we will come no more unto thee?</p>
<p>24. Can a virgo forget her ornamenta, or a sponsa her girdle? yet my populus hath forgotten me dies innumerabiles.</p>
<p>25. Arise, O virgo, and circumeas the civitatem, vide if thou canst find a vir, if there be any that executeth iudicium, that seeketh veritatem; and I will pardon her.</p>
<p>26. And I have seen thy iudicium, but it was not iustitia, and thy iustitia, but it was not aequitas.</p>
<p>27. Ierusalem, Ierusalem, thou hast not cognitum the Lord, thou hast not recollectum the dies of antiqua: therefore thou shalt be delivered into manus of the inimicus, and thou shalt be in captivitas.</p>
<p>28. Rise up, O Ierusalem, and vide the civitatem, if thou canst find a vir, if there be any that executeth iudicium, that seeketh veritatem; and I will pardon her.</p>
<p>29. And I have seen thy iudicium, but it was not iustitia, and thy iustitia, but it was not aequitas.</p>
<p>30. Ierusalem, Ierusalem, why dost thou not recollectum the Lord, and why dost thou not seek veritatem? for I am the Lord thy Deus, and I will pardon thy peccata, and I will restore thee to the terra of antiqua.</p>
<p>31. O Ierusalem, Ierusalem, why dost thou not vide the veritatem, and why dost thou not seek iustitia? for I am the Lord thy Deus, and I will pardon thy peccata, and I will restore thee to the terra of antiqua.</p>
