  "And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in mine house, and the ancients of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Dominus Jehovah fell there upon me.",
  "Then I beheld, and lo a similitude as the appearance of Terra, like as burnished electrum, and it was the similitude of the forma of a man from beneath.",
  "From the appearance of his lumbi even downward, I saw as it were polished electrum, and from the appearance of his lumbi even upward, I saw as it were the similitude of ignis, and there was splendor round about.",
  "Lo, this was the appearance of the similitude of the Gloria Jehovah. And when I saw it, I fell upon my facies, and I heard a voice of one that spake.",
  "And he said unto me, Son of homo, I send thee to domus Israel, to gentes rebellious, which have rebelled against me: they and their patres have transgressed against me, even unto this very day.",
  "And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith Dominus Jehovah: If they will hearken and obey, I will hear and obey, but if they will not hearken and obey, then I will visit their iniquitates upon them.",
  "And they shall know that a propheta hath been among them, thou, and the gentes, they shall know.",
  "And if they will not hearken and obey, because the domus is rebellious, yet they shall know that there hath been a propheta in the midst of them.",
  "And thou, son of homo, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their verba, though briers and thorns be with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpiones: be not afraid of their verba, nor be dismayed at their facies, for they are a rebellious domus.",
  "And thou shalt speak my verba unto them, whether they will hearken and obey, or whether they will forbear: for they are a rebellious domus.",
  "Yet they shall know that there hath been a propheta among them.",
  "And behold, the manus of the Dominus was upon me, and carried me out in the spirit of Jehovah, and set me down in the midst of the valle which was full of ossa,",
  "And caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, there were very many in the superficies of the valle; and, lo, they were very dry.",
  "Again he said unto me, Propheta, these ossa are the whole domus of Israel: behold, they say, Our ossa are dried, and our spes is lost: we are clean cut off from our hereditas.",
  "Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus saith Dominus Jehovah: Behold, O my people, I will open your sepulchres, and cause you to come up out of your sepulchres, and bring you into the terra of Israel.",
  "And ye shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have opened your sepulchres, O my people, and brought you up out of your sepulchres,",
  "And shall put my Spiritus in you, and ye shall live, and I shall place you in your own terra: then shall ye know that I Jehovah have spoken it, and performed it, saith Jehovah.",
  "The hand of Jehovah was upon me, and carried me out in the Spiritus of Jehovah, and set me down in the midst of a valle which was full of ossa.",
  "And he said unto me, Propheta, can these ossa live? And I answered, O Dominus Jehovah, thou knowest.",
  "Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon these ossa, and say unto them, O ye ossa, hear the word of Jehovah.",
  "Hark, behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live:",
  "And I will put nervi upon you, and bring up carne upon you, and cover you with pellis, and put spiritus in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.",
  "So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the ossa came together, ossa to ossa.",
  "In the same hour I shall speak concerning thee, and will make thee my mouth, and thou shalt be my propheta, to speak all that I command thee to speak, saith the Dominus Jehovah."
