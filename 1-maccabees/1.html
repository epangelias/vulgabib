                    <p>And Apollonius, the son of Panaeus, who was commander-in-chief of the Mysians, came to meet him in battle array, and it seemed to him that he was going to get the better of Judas, and he cried out to him in the language of the Greeks, saying, 'Fall back, and let the cavalry engage, for the battle is fierce' and the Latins called it 'pugna'.</p>
<p>But Judas, seeing the strength of the cavalry, that they were skilled in 'pugna', gave orders to his troops to pray and to beg God to send them help, saying, 'It is not 'arma' and 'scutum' that will give us the victory, but thy 'voluntas'.'</p>
<p>And they went into the 'campus' of the uncircumcised, and Judas cried out to the men, saying, 'Do not 'cupidi' the 'spolia', for the 'pugna' is not yet at an end.'</p>
<p>So they obeyed the words of Judas, and did not 'cupidi' the 'spolia'.</p>
<p>Now when Apollonius drew near, Judas went out to meet him, and they clashed in 'proelium'.</p>
<p>And Apollonius had a 'cohors' of five thousand foot soldiers, and five hundred 'equites', and twenty-two 'elephanti'.</p>
<p>And Judas chose Eupolemus, the son of John, the son of Accos, and Jason, the son of Eleazar, and gave them 'imperium' over the 'cohors' that was with him.</p>
<p>They then drew up their 'acies', and went into the 'campus' of the uncircumcised, and the 'milites' of the 'cohors' were afraid, and many of them 'fugerunt'.</p>
<p>But Judas and his 'milites' pursued them from behind, and the 'milites' of the 'cohors' were slain, and they recovered the 'spolia'.</p>
