                    <p>My spirit is broken, my days are extinct, the graves are ready for me.</p>
<p>How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart daily?</p>
<p>Shall I have dominion over my own veritas, and shall I be saved from the hand of the inimicus?</p>
<p>My friends scorn me: but mine oculus is upon Thee, O Deus.</p>
<p>I call to the testificator, and I bring my manus to the iudicium.</p>
<p>My skin is black upon me, and my ossa are burned with febris.</p>
<p>My lyra also is turned to luctus, and my organum to the voice of those qui plorant.</p>
<p>And ut I said, My spirit is broken, my dies are extinct, the sepulchra are ready for me.</p>
<p>These novi homines are those with whom I have been in amicitia, who now perspicaciously propter tenebras deride me.</p>
<p>The manus of Deus hath dealt this, and He hath delivered me to the inimicus.</p>
<p>When His manus touched me, I felt horrorem, and for the timor of Him, I did rise, and I did stand.</p>
<p>He hath destroyed me on every latus, and I am gone, and hath taken away my spes, as a destructor of a arbor.</p>
<p>And this is one thing, in quo I have fiducia, that I shall behold His facies in iudicium.</p>
<p>Oculus non videbit eum, sed Tu, o Deus, videbis eum, propter hanc spem meam, quae est apud Te.</p>
<p>For I know, that my iustificatio is in caelis, and that my Testificator is in caelis.</p>
<p>My friends deride me, but mine oculus is upon Thee, O Deus, qui es meus iudex.</p>
<p>Oculus non videbit eum, sed Tu, o Deus, videbis eum, propter hanc spem meam, quae est apud Te.</p>
<p>Put not fiducia in inimicos, neque speres in filios hominum, in quibus non est salus.</p>
