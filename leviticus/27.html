                    <p>1 And this is the law of the votum, which Moses spake unto the children of Israel according to the commandment of the Lord.</p>
<p>2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a man shall make a singularis votum, the estimation whereof shall be of the souls, according to thy estimation.</p>
<p>3 And thy estimation shall be of the masculus from twenty years old even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of argentum, according to the shekel of the sanctuarium.</p>
<p>4 And if it be a femina, then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels.</p>
<p>5 And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old, thy estimation shall be of the masculus twenty shekels, and for the femina ten shekels.</p>
<p>6 And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the masculus five shekels of argentum, and for the femina thy estimation shall be three shekels of argentum.</p>
<p>7 And if it be from sixty years old and above; if it be a masculus, then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the femina ten shekels.</p>
<p>8 But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present himself before the sacerdos, and the sacerdos shall value him; according to his ability that vowed shall the sacerdos value him.</p>
<p>9 And if it be animalia, whereof men bring an oblatio unto the Lord, all that any man giveth of such unto the Lord shall be sanctus.</p>
<p>10 He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a malus, or a malus for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then it and the exchange thereof shall be sanctus.</p>
<p>11 And if it be any immundus animal, which they do not offer as an oblatio unto the Lord, then he shall present the animal before the sacerdos:</p>
<p>12 And the sacerdos shall value it, whether it be bonum or malus: as thou valuest it, who art the sacerdos, so shall it be.</p>
<p>13 But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth part thereof unto thy estimation.</p>
<p>14 And when a man shall sanctify his domus to be sanctus unto the Lord, then the sacerdos shall estimate it, whether it be bonum or malus: as the sacerdos shall estimate it, so shall it stand.</p>
<p>15 And if he that sanctified it will redeem his domus, then he shall add the fifth part of the argentum of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be his.</p>
<p>16 And if a man shall sanctify unto the Lord some part of a field of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the seed thereof: an homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of argentum.</p>
<p>17 If he sanctify his field from the anno of jubilee, according to thy estimation it shall stand.</p>
<p>18 But if he sanctify his field after the jubilee, then the sacerdos shall reckon unto him the argentum according to the years that remain, even unto the anno of the jubilee, and it shall be abated from thy estimation.</p>
<p>19 And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the argentum of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be assured to him.</p>
<p>20 And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.</p>
<p>21 But the field, when it goeth out in the jubilee, shall be sanctus unto the Lord, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the sacerdos'.</p>
<p>22 And if a man sanctify unto the Lord a field which he hath bought, which is not of the fields of his possession;</p>
<p>23 Then the sacerdos shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation, even unto the anno of the jubilee: and he shall give thine estimation in that day, as a thing sanctus unto the Lord.</p>
<p>24 In the anno of the jubilee the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land did belong.</p>
<p>25 And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuarium: twenty obols shall be five shekels, tenpence shall be an half shekel, and five pence shall be a shekel.</p>
<p>26 Only the primogenitus of the animals, which should be the Lord's firstling, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox, or sheep: it is the Lord's.</p>
<p>27 And if it be of an immundus animal, then he shall redeem it according to thine estimation, and shall add a fifth part of it thereto: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to thy estimation.</p>
<p>28 Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto the Lord of all that he hath, both of man and beast, and of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most sanctus unto the Lord.</p>
<p>29 None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed; but shall surely be put to death.</p>
<p>30 And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the Lord's: it is sanctus unto the Lord.</p>
<p>31 And if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes, he shall add thereto the fifth part thereof.</p>
<p>32 And concerning the tithe of the oxen, or of the sheep, even of whatsoever passeth under the virga of the numberer;</p>
<p>33 The tenth part thereof shall be sanctus unto the Lord.</p>
<p>34 This is the commandment of the Lord, which he commanded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai.</p>
