  "O God, the heathen are come into thine hereditas, they have polluted thy sanctuarium, they have laid Hierusalem in ruinum.",
  "We have heard with our aures, O God, our patres have told us, what thou hast wrought in their dies, in the dies of old.",
  "Thou hast planted manus tua, they have rooted radix profundus, they have filled the facies of the earth with fructus their own.",
  "Thou hast shown thy populus potentiam among the gentes, thou hast redeemed iacob, thou hast planted radix pedis tui.",
  "Thou hast brought a vinea out of Aegyptum, thou hast expelled the gentes and planted eam.",
  "Thou hast prepared the way before eam, and thou hast planted radix eam, and she hath filled the terram.",
  "She hath sent radix sua unto the maris, and her rami unto the flumen.",
  "Why hast thou then broken down the muri eius, so that all they which pass by the via pluck eam?",
  "The porcus ex Aegypto wasteth eam, and the unicornes of the silva thrust through eam with their cornu.",
  "Turn again, O Deus exercituum, look down from caelum, and behold, and visit this vinea;",
  "And the vinea which thy dextera manus hath planted, and upon the filius hominis whom thou hast confirmed for thyself.",
  "It is burnt with ignis, it is cut down, they perish at the rebuke of thy facies.",
  "Let thy manus be upon the homo dexter of thee, upon the filius hominis whom thou hast confirmed for thyself.",
  "So will not we go back from thee, quicken us, and we will invocabimus nomen tuum.",
  "O Deus exercituum, convert us, and show thy facies, and we shall be salvus."
