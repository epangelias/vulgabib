  "Paulus, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of electi Dei, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after pietas;",
  "Unto the electi, through the forescience of God the Father, in sanctificatio of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the sanguis of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and pax, from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.",
  "As I besought thee to tarry at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,",
  "Neither give heed to fables and genealogiae, and endless fabul√¶, which minister questions, rather than godly edificatio which is in fide.",
  "But unto the ungodly and seditious, and disobedient, and unto them that are without the law, and unto the lawless, and unto the wicked, and unto the vos amatores of pleasure more than vos amatores of God;",
  "The saying is faithful, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain bona opera.",
  "They profess that they know Deus, but in opera they deny him, being abominabili, and disobedient, and unto every bonne opera reprobati."
