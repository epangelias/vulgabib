                    <p>1 Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his populus, to fight at Edrei. 2 And the Lord said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his exercitus, and his terra, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon. 3 So the Lord our Deus delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his populus: and we smote him until none was left him remaining. 4 And we took all his urbes at that time, there was not a civitas which we took not from them, threescore urbes, all the regio of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 5 All these urbes were fenced with muri alti, portae, and barrae, beside unwalled urbes a great many. 6 And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the populus of every civitas, homines, mulieres, and parvuli. 7 But all the jumenta, and the spolia of the urbes, we took for ourselves. 8 And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the terra that was on this side Jordan, from the rivulus Arnon unto mount Hermon; 9 (Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it Shenir;) 10 All the urbes of the plateau, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, urbes of the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 11 For only Og king of Bashan remained of the rest of Rephaim; behold, his lectus was a lectus of iron. Is it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a homo. 12 And this terra, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which is by the rivulus Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the urbes thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites. 13 And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribus of Manasseh; all the regio of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the terra of Rephaim. 14 Jair the filius of Manasseh took all the regio of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri, and Maachathi; and called them after his own nomem, Bashanhavothjair, unto this dies. 15 And I gave Gilead unto Machir. 16 And unto the tribus of Reuben and unto the Gadites gave I from Gilead even unto the rivulus Arnon half the vallis, and the limites even unto the rivulus Jabbok, which is the terminus of the children of Ammon; 17 The Jordan also was the terminus thereof, from Chinnereth even unto the mare of the plain, even the Salt mare, under the slopes of Pisgah eastward. 18 And I commanded you at that time, saying, The Lord your Deus hath given you this terra to possess it: ye shall pass over armed before your fratres the filii of Israel, all that are mighty and valiant for the pugna. 19 But your uxores, and your parvuli, and your pecora, (for I know that ye have much pecora,) shall abide in your urbes which I have given you; 20 Until the Lord have given rest unto your fratres, as well as unto you, and they also possess the terra which the Lord your Deus hath given them beyond Jordan: and then shall ye return every homo unto his possessio, which I have given you. 21 And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that the Lord your Deus hath done unto these two kings: so shall the Lord do unto all the regna whither thou passest. 22 Ye shall not fear them: for the Lord your Deus he shall fight for you. 23 And I prayed unto the Lord at that time, saying, 24 O Lord Deus, thou hast begun to shew thy servus thy magnitudo, and thy manum potentem; for what Deus is there in caelum or in terra, that can do according to thy opera, and according to thy potentia? 25 I pray thee, let me go over, and see the bona terra that is beyond Jordan, that good mountain, and Lebanon. 26 But the Lord was iratus with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and the Lord said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this matter. 27 Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thy oculi westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold it with thine oculi: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan. 28 But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over before this populus, and he shall cause them to inherit the terra which thou shalt see. 29 So we abode in the vallis over against Bethpeor.</p>
