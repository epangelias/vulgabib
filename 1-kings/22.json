  "And they continued three years without war between Syria and Israel.",
  "But it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.",
  "And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that Ramoth in Gilead is ours, and we be still, and take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria?",
  "And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramothgilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my equus as thy equus.",
  "And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Inquire, I pray thee, at the word of the Dominus to day.",
  "Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the Deus shall deliver it into the hand of the king.",
  "And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the Dominus besides, that we might inquire of him?",
  "And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may inquire of the Dominus: but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil.",
  "And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.",
  "Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten hither Micaiah the son of Imlah.",
  "And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat either of them on his thronus, clothed in their vestimenta, in a vacant place in the entrance of the porta of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.",
  "And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him cornua of ferre, and said, Thus saith the Dominus, With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until thou have consumed them.",
  "And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the Dominus shall deliver it into the king's hand.",
  "And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spake unto him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets declare good unto the king with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak that which is bonus.",
  "And Micaiah said, As the Dominus liveth, what the Dominus saith unto me, that will I speak.",
  "So he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered him, Go, and prosper: for the Dominus shall deliver it into the hand of the king.",
  "And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but that which is verus in the name of the Dominus?",
  "And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the montes, as sheep that have not a pastor: and the Dominus said, These have no dominus; let them return every man to his domus in pace.",
  "And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil?",
  "And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the Dominus: I saw the Dominus sitting on his thronus, and all the exercitus of caelum standing by him on his right hand and on his left.",
  "And the Dominus said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one said on this manner, and another said on that manner.",
  "And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the Dominus, and said, I will persuade him.",
  "And the Dominus said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go forth, and I will be a spiritus of mendacium in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt persuade him, and prevail also: go forth, and do so.",
  "Now therefore, behold, the Dominus hath put a spiritus of mendacium in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and the Dominus hath spoken malum concerning thee.",
  "But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spiritus of the Dominus from me to speak unto thee?",
  "And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see in that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.",
  "And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the son of Ahab:",
  "And say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the carcer, and feed him with panis of affliction and with aqua of affliction, until I come in pace.",
  "And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in pace, the Dominus hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, O people, every one of you.",
  "So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramothgilead.",
  "And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy vestimenta. And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.",
  "But the king of Syria commanded his thirty-two captains that had rule over his curru, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.",
  "And it came to pass, when the captains of the curru saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel. And they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out.",
  "And it came to pass, when the captains of the curru perceived that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.",
  "And a certain man drew a arcus at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the loricam: wherefore he said unto the driver of his currus, Turn thine hands, and carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.",
  "And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his currus against the Syrians, and died in the vespere: and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the currus.",
  "And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the setting of the sol, saying, Every man to his civitas, and every man to his own terra.",
  "So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried him in Samaria.",
  "And one washed the currus in the piscina of Samaria; and the canes licked up his sanguis; according unto the word of the Dominus which he spake.",
  "Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the domus of ivory which he made, and all the civitates that he built, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?",
  "So Ahab slept with his patres; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead."
