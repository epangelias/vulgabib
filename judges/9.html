                    <p>And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his mother's brethren, and communed with them, and with all the family of the house of his mother's father, saying,</p>
<p>Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem, Whether is better for you, that all the sons of Jerubbaal, which are threescore and ten persons, reign over you, or that one reign over you? Remember also that I am your os, flesh.</p>
<p>And his mother's brethren spake of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words: and their animus, heart, inclined to follow Abimelech; for they said, He is our frater, brother.</p>
<p>And they gave him septuaginta, seventy pieces of argentum, silver, out of the domus, house of Baalberith, wherewith Abimelech hired vain and light personas, persons, and they followed him.</p>
<p>And he went unto the domus, house of his pater, father Jerubbaal, unto Ophrah, and slew his fratres, brethren the sons of Jerubbaal, being seventy personas, persons, upon one saxum, stone: notwithstanding yet Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid himself.</p>
<p>And all the cives, citizens of Shechem gathered together, and all the domus, house of Millo, and went, and made Abimelech rex, king, by the platano, plain of the columna, pillar that was in Shechem.</p>
<p>And when they told it to Jotham, he went and stood in the summitas, top of the mons, mount Gerizim, and lifted up his vox, voice, and cried, and said unto them, Hearken unto me, ye cives, citizens of Shechem, that God may hearken unto you.</p>
<p>The lignum, trees went forth on a certain die, day to anoint a rex, king over them; and they said unto the oliva, olive tree, Reign thou over us.</p>
<p>But the oliva, olive tree said unto them, Should I leave my unctio, anointing, wherewith by me they honor Deus, God and Deus, man, and go to be promoted over the lignum, trees?</p>
<p>And the lignum, trees said to the ficus, fig tree, Come thou, and reign over us.</p>
<p>But the ficus, fig tree said unto them, Should I forsake my dulcis, sweetness, and my bonum, good fructus, fruit, to go to be promoted over the lignum, trees?</p>
<p>Then said the lignum, trees unto the vitis, vine, Come thou, and reign over us.</p>
<p>And the vitis, vine said unto them, Should I leave my vinum, wine, which cheereth Deus, God and Deus, man, and go to be promoted over the lignum, trees?</p>
<p>Then said all the lignum, trees unto the Spinus, bramble, Come thou, and reign over us.</p>
<p>And the Spinus, bramble said unto the lignum, trees, If in veritate, truth ye anoint me rex, king over you, then come and put your trust in my umbra, shadow: and if not, let ignis, fire come out of the Spinus, bramble, and devour the cedri, cedars of Lebanon.</p>
<p>Now therefore, if ye have acted in veritas, truth and integritas, integrity to make Abimelech rex, king, and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his domus, house, and have done unto him according to the merita, merits of his manus, hands;</p>
<p>(For my pater, father fought for you, and adventured his animus, life, and delivered you out of the manus, hand of Madian:)</p>
<p>And ye are risen up against my patris, father's domus, house this die, day, and have slain his filios, sons, being seventy personas, persons, upon one saxum, stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his ancilla, handmaid, rex, king over the cives, citizens of Shechem, because he is your frater;)</p>
<p>That if ye have acted in veritas, truth and integritas, integrity with Jerubbaal and with his domus, house this die, day, then rejoice ye in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you:</p>
<p>But if not, let ignis, fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the cives, citizens of Shechem, and the domus, house of Millo; and let ignis, fire come out from the cives, citizens of Shechem, and from the domus, house of Millo, and devour Abimelech.</p>
<p>And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt there, for fear of Abimelech his frater.</p>
<p>When Abimelech had reigned over Israel three annos, years,</p>
<p>Deus, God sent an malevolentia, evil spirit between Abimelech and the cives, citizens of Shechem; and the cives, citizens of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech:</p>
<p>That the malevolentia, evil of the homines, men of Shechem might come, and that Abimelech might be punished for the sanguinem, blood of the filii, sons of Jerubbaal, and for all the sanguis, blood that he shed: and that the cives, citizens of Shechem might be punished for their peccatum, sin, wherewith they had sinned.</p>
<p>And the cives, citizens of Shechem set lienae, liers in wait for him in the summitas, tops of the montes, mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by them: and it was told Abimelech.</p>
<p>And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his fratres, brethren, and went over to Shechem: and the cives, citizens of Shechem put their trust in him.</p>
<p>And they went out into the ager, field, and gathered their vineas, vineyards, and trod the uvas, grapes: and made festum, feasts, and went into the domus, house of their Deus, god, and did eat and drank, and cursed Abimelech.</p>
<p>And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? is not he son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officiarius, officer? serve ye the viri, men of Hamor the pater, father of Shechem: for why should we serve him?</p>
<p>And would to Deus, God this populus, people were under my manus, hand! then would I remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase thine exercitus, army, and come out.</p>
<p>And when Zebul the prince of the cives, citizens of Shechem heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his animus, heart was kindled.</p>
<p>And he sent messengers unto Abimelech privily, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his fratres, brethren be come to Shechem; and, behold, they fortify the civitas, city against thee.</p>
<p>Now therefore up by nocte, night, thou and the populus, people that is with thee, and lie in wait in the ager, field:</p>
<p>And it shall be, that in the mane, morning, as soon as the sol, sun is up, thou shalt rise up early, and set upon the civitas, city: and, behold, when he and the populus, people that is with him come out against thee, then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find occasion.</p>
<p>And Abimelech rose up, and all the populus, people that were with him, by nocte, night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four coetus, companies.</p>
<p>And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the porta, gate of the civitas, city: and Abimelech rose up, and the populus, people that were with him from lying in wait.</p>
<p>And when Gaal saw the populus, people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there come populus, people down from the summitas, tops of the montes, mountains. And Zebul said unto him, Thou seest the umbra, shadow of the montes, mountains as if they were homines, men.</p>
<p>And Gaal spake again and said, See there come populus, people down by the medio, middle of the terra, earth, and another coetus, company come along by the platano, plain of Meonenim.</p>
<p>Then said Zebul unto him, Where is now thy os, mouth, wherewith thou saidst, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? is not this the populus, people that thou hast despised? go out, I pray now, and fight with them.</p>
<p>And Gaal went out before the cives, citizens of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech.</p>
<p>And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and there fell many wounded, even unto the porta, gate of the civitas, city.</p>
<p>And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul thrust out Gaal and his fratres, brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem.</p>
<p>And it came to pass on the sequens, following die, day, that the populus, people went out into the ager, field; and they told Abimelech.</p>
<p>And he took the populus, people, and divided them into three coetus, companies, and laid wait in the ager, field, and looked, and, behold, the populus, people were come forth out of the civitas, city; and he rose up against them, and smote them.</p>
<p>And Abimelech, and the coetus, company that was with him, rushed forward, and stood in the porta, gate of the civitas, city: and the other two coetus, companies ran upon all the populus, people that were in the ager, field, and slew them.</p>
<p>And Abimelech fought against the civitas, city all that die, day; and he took the civitas, city, and slew the populus, people that was therein, and beat down the civitas, city, and sowed it with sal, salt.</p>
<p>And when all the cives, citizens of the turris, tower of Shechem heard that, they entered into an hold of the templum, temple of the Deus, god Berith.</p>
<p>And it was told Abimelech, that all the cives, citizens of the turris, tower of Shechem were gathered together.</p>
<p>And Abimelech gat him up to the mons, mount Zalmon, he and all the populus, people that were with him; and Abimelech took an ascia, axe in his manus, hand, and cut down a ramus, branch from the lignum, trees, and took it, and laid it on his umerus, shoulder, and said unto the populus, people that were with him, What ye have seen me do, make haste, and do as I have done.</p>
<p>And all the populus, people likewise cut down every man his ramus, branch, and followed Abimelech, and put them to the porta, gate of the turris, tower, and set the turris, tower on ignis, fire upon them; so that all the cives, citizens of the turris, tower of Shechem died also, a thousand personas, persons, men and mulieres, women.</p>
<p>Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it.</p>
<p>But there was a forte, strong turris, tower within the civitas, city, and thither fled all the homines, men and mulieres, women, and all they of the civitas, city, and shut it to them, and gat them up to the tectum, roof of the turris, tower.</p>
<p>And Abimelech came unto the turris, tower, and fought against it, and went hard unto the porta, gate of the turris, tower to burn it with ignis, fire.</p>
<p>And a certain mulier, woman cast a piece of a mola, millstone upon Abimelech's caput, head, and all to brake his calvaria, skull.</p>
<p>Then he called hastily unto the iuvenis, young man his armorbearer, and said unto him, Draw thy gladius, sword, and slay me, that men say not of me, A mulier, woman slew him. And his armorbearer thrust him through, and he died.</p>
<p>And when the viri, men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man unto his domus, house.</p>
<p>Thus Deus, God rendered the malevolentia, evil of Abimelech, which he did unto his pater, father, in slaying his seventy fratres, brethren:</p>
<p>And all the malevolentia, evil of the homines, men of Shechem did Deus, God render upon their caput, head: and upon them came the malevolentia, evil of Jotham's maledictio, curse.</p>
