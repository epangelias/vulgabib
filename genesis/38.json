  "And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his fratres and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose nomen was Hirah.",
  "And Judah saw there a filia of a certain Canaanite, whose nomen was Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.",
  "And she conceived, and bare a filius, and he called his nomen Er.",
  "And she conceived again, and bare a filius; and she called his nomen Onan.",
  "And she yet again conceived, and bare a filius; and called his nomen Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.",
  "And Judah took a uxor for Er his primogenitus, whose nomen was Tamar.",
  "And Er, Judah's primogenitus, was malus in the sight of the Dominus; therefore the Dominus slew him.",
  "And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy fratris uxor, and marry her, and raise up semen to thy frater.",
  "And Onan knew that the semen should not be his: and it came to pass, when he went in unto his fratris uxor, that he frustratus it on the ground, lest that he should give semen to his frater.",
  "And the thing which he did displeased the Dominus: wherefore he slew him also.",
  "Then said Judah to Tamar his nuora, Remain a vidua at thy patris domus, till Shelah my filius be magnus; (for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his fratres did.) And Tamar went and dwelt in her patris domus.",
  "And in process of time the filia of Shuah Judah's uxor died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his shearers to Timnath, he and his amicus Hirah the Adullamite.",
  "And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy socer goeth up to Timnath to shear his oves.",
  "And she put her vidua's vestimenta off from her, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped her self, and sat in an ostium of Enaim; which is by the via of Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was magnus, and she was not given unto him to uxor.",
  "When Judah saw her, he thought her to be a meretrix; because she had covered her faciem.",
  "And he turned unto her by the via, and said, Come, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was his nuora.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?",
  "And he said, I will send thee a caprum from the gregem. And she said, Wilt thou give me a pignus, till thou send it?",
  "And he said, What pignus shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet, and thy corda, and thy baculus that is in thine manu. And he gave it her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.",
  "And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put on the vestimenta of her viduitatis.",
  "And Judah sent the caprum by the hand of his amicus the Adullamite, to receive his pignus from the mulier's manu: but he found her not.",
  "Then he asked the homines of that loco, saying, Where is the meretrix, that was ostium in Enaim by the via? And they said, There was no meretrix in this loco.",
  "And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the homines of the loco said, that there was no meretrix in this loco.",
  "And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be in derisum: behold, I sent this caprum, and thou couldest not find her.",
  "And it came to pass about tres menses after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy nuora hath played the meretrix; and also, behold, she is pregnant by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be combusta.",
  "When she was brought forth, she sent to her socer, saying, By the homo, whose these are, am I pregnant: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and corda, and baculus.",
  "And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been justior than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my filius. And he knew her again no more.",
  "And it came to pass in the time of her partum, that, behold, gemini were in her uterus.",
  "And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out his manu: and the obstetrix bound upon his manu a filum coccineum, saying, This came out primus.",
  "And it came to pass, as he drew back his manu, that, behold, his frater came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? this breach be upon thee: therefore his nomen was called Pharez.",
  "And afterward came out his frater, that had the filum coccineum upon his manu: and his nomen was called Zarah."
