                    <p>And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not through the way of the terra of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Aegyptum.</p>
<p>But God led the people about, through the way of the desert of the Red mare; and the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the terra of Aegyptum.</p>
<p>And Moses took the ossa of Ioseph with him: for he had straitly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and ye shall carry up my ossa away hence with you.</p>
<p>And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the extremity of the desert.</p>
<p>And the Lord went before them by day in a columna of nubes, to lead them the way; and by night in a columna of ignis, to give them lumen, to go by day and night:</p>
<p>He took not away the columna of nubes by day, nor the columna of ignis by night, from before the people.</p>
<p>And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p>Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pi-ha-hiroth, between Migdol and the mare, over against Baal-zephon: before it shall ye encamp by the mare.</p>
<p>For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are entangled in the terra, the desert hath shut them in.</p>
<p>And I will harden Pharaoh's cor, that he shall follow after them; and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his exercitus, that the Aegyptii may know that I am the Lord. And they did so.</p>
<p>And it was told the king of Aegyptum that the people fled: and the cor of Pharaoh and of his servitors was turned against the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us?</p>
<p>So he made ready his currus, and took his people with him:</p>
<p>And he took six hundred chosen currus, and all the currus of Aegyptum, and captains over every one of them.</p>
<p>And the Lord hardened the cor of Pharaoh king of Aegyptum, and he pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went out with an stretched out manus.</p>
<p>And the Aegyptii pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the mare, even all Pharaoh's currus, his equites, and his exercitus.</p>
<p>And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the Lord looked unto the exercitus of the Aegyptii through the columna of nubes and of ignis, and troubled the exercitus of the Aegyptii,</p>
<p>And took off their wheels, that they drave them heavily: so that the Aegyptii said, Let us flee from the facies of Israel; for the Lord fighteth for them against the Aegyptii.</p>
<p>And the Lord said unto Moses, Stretch out thine manus over the mare, that the waters may come again upon the Aegyptii, upon their currus, and upon their equites.</p>
<p>And Moses stretched forth his manus over the mare, and the mare returned to his former place towards the morning; and the Aegyptii fled against it; and the Lord overthrew the Aegyptii in the midst of the mare.</p>
<p>And the waters returned, and covered the currus, and the equites, and all the exercitus of Pharaoh that came into the mare after them; there remained not so much as one of them.</p>
<p>But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the mare; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.</p>
<p>Thus the Lord saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Aegyptii; and Israel saw the Aegyptii dead upon the sea shore.</p>
<p>And Israel saw that great work which the Lord did upon the Aegyptii: and the people feared the Lord, and believed the Lord, and his servus Moses.</p>
