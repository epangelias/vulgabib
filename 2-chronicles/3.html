                    <p>1 And Solomon began to build the templum of the Lord at Hierusalem in mount Moriah, where the Lord appeared unto David his pater, in the place that David had prepared in the area of Ornan the Jebusite.</p>
<p>2 And he began to build in the secundus day of the secundus month, in the fourth year of his regnum.</p>
<p>3 Now these are the things wherein Solomon was instructed for the building of the templum of God. The length by cubits after the ancient measure was threescore cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.</p>
<p>4 And the porche that was before the templum, the length of it was according to the breadth of the templum, twenty cubits, and the height an hundred and twenty: and he overlaid it with aurum pure.</p>
<p>5 And the maior templum he cased with bois of cypress, which he overlaid with fine aurum, and set thereon palm trees and chaines.</p>
<p>6 And he garnished the templum with precious stones; and the aurum was aurum of Parvaim.</p>
<p>7 He overlaid also the house, the beams, the posts, and the walls thereof, and the doors thereof, with aurum; and graved cherubim on the walls.</p>
<p>8 And he made the house of the Sanctum Sanctorum: the length of it was according to the breadth of the templum, twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits: and he overlaid it with aurum of six hundred talents.</p>
<p>9 And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of aurum. And he overlaid the upper chambers with aurum.</p>
<p>10 And in the house of the Sanctum Sanctorum he made two cherubim of wood, and overlaid them with aurum.</p>
<p>11 And the wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits long: the one wing of the one cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing was likewise five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub.</p>
<p>12 And the wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing was five cubits also, joining to the wing of the other cherub.</p>
<p>13 These wings were stretched out, and received every one of them ten cubits: and they stood on their pedes, with their facies inward.</p>
<p>14 And he made the vail of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and wrought cherubim thereon.</p>
<p>15 Also he made before the house two columns of thirty and five cubits high, and the chapiter that was on the top of each of them was five cubits.</p>
<p>16 And he made chains, as in the Sanctum, and put them on the heads of the columns; and made an hundred granati to put upon the chains.</p>
<p>17 And he reared up the columns before the templum, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.</p>
