                    <p>Woe to the rebellious children, saith the Lord, that take councel, sed non ex me, and that cover with a covering, sed non de spiritu meo, that they may add sinne to sinne:</p>
<p>That walk to go downe into Aegyptum, and have not asked at my os, to strengthen themselves in fortitudine of Pharaonis, and to trust in the shadow of Aegypti.</p>
<p>For the fortitudo of Pharaonis shall be to you for a snare, and the trust in the shadow of Aegypti for a decepitio.</p>
<p>For his principes were at Tsoan, and his ambassatores came to Chanesse,</p>
<p>They were all confounded of a populo, who could not proficere them, nor be an auxilium, nor a subsidium for them.</p>
<p>The burden of the beasts of the south: into the land of affliction and angustia, from whence come the vipera and the flying dracon, they carry their riches upon the dorsum of the asinus, and their thesaurus upon the gibbositas of the camelus, to a populo that shall not proficere them.</p>
<p>For the Aegyptii shall helpe in vanum, and to no purpose: therefore have I cryed concerning this, Superbus eritis, sed nihil proficere poteritis.</p>
<p>Now goe, and write it before them in a tabula, and note it in a libro, that it may be for the futurum semper, and for ever and ever:</p>
<p>That this is a rebellious people, lying children, children that will not hear the law of the Lord:</p>
<p>That say to the videntes, Videte non; and to the prophetis, Prophetae non; but if you had spoken to us in lingua mollis, then would we have obeyed your vocem.</p>
<p>Now therefore goe, and write it before them in a tabula, and note it in a libro, that it may be for the futurum semper, and for ever and ever:</p>
<p>That this is a rebellious people, lying children, children that will not hear the law of the Lord:</p>
<p>Which say to the videntes, Videte non; and to the prophetis, Prophetae non; but if you had spoken to us in lingua mollis, then would we have obeyed your vocem.</p>
<p>Yea, for all his righteousnesse shall not proficere them, for they are a populus of perversitie: they will not hear the law of the Lord:</p>
<p>Which say to the videntes, Videte non; and to the prophetis, Prophetae non; but if you had spoken to us in lingua mollis, then would we have obeyed your vocem.</p>
<p>And the Lord saith, Because this people drawe near to me with their os, and with their labia honour me, but have removed their cor from me, and their timor towards me is taught by the mandata of men:</p>
<p>Therefore behold, I will proceede to doe a marvelous worke among this people, even a marvelous worke and a wonder: for the sapientia of their sapientes shall perish, and the intelligentia of their intelligentes shall be hid.</p>
<p>Woe unto them that seeke deep to hide their cogitationem from the Lord, and their opera are in the tenebrae, and they say, Qui videt nos? and Qui cognoscit nos?</p>
<p>Shall not the artifex be knowne by his opera? and the figulus by his fictilis work? for the cogitationem of this people is perverse and their viae are depravate.</p>
<p>Woe unto them that call malum bonum, and bonum malum, that put tenebrae for lumen, and lumen for tenebrae, that put amarum for dulce, and dulce for amarum.</p>
<p>Woe unto them that are sapientes in their own eyes, and prudentes in their own aspectu.</p>
<p>Woe unto them that are potentes to drink wine, and viri fortes to mingle strong drink:</p>
<p>Which iustificare the impium for a munus, and take away the iustitia of the iustus from him.</p>
<p>Therefore as the lingua of the ignis devoureth the stipula, and the chaff is consumed by the flamma, so their radix shall be as putredo, and their flores shall ascend as pulvis: for they have rejected the law of the Lord of hostes, and despised the verbum of the Holy One of Israel.</p>
<p>Therefore is the ira of the Lord kindled against his people, and he hath stretched forth his manum against them, and hath smitten them: and the montes are shaken, and their cadavera are as dung in the medio of the streets: for all this his indignatio is not turned away, but his manum is stretched out still.</p>
<p>And he will lift up an signum to the gentes from farre, and will hissit with an hisso to the finis of the terra: and behold, they shall come with velocitas swiftly.</p>
<p>None shall be wearie, nor stumble among them: none shall slumber nor sleep, neither shall the cinctura of their lumbi be loosed, nor the latchet of their calciolus be broken:</p>
<p>Their arcoes shall be in the tensio, and all their sagittae shall be sharpe: the ungula of their equus shall be counted as ferrum, and the rotarum of their currus as a turbo.</p>
<p>The roare of their equus shall be like the leao, and they shall roare like the leones: yea, they shall roare and lay hold of the praeda, and none shall escape: and in that day they shall roare over them like the mari.</p>
<p>And behold, the terra shall be darker then the tenebrae, and the lumen of the celum shall be obscurum with the caligo.</p>
<p>And the Lord shall give them up to a consumption, and the terra shall be devoured with desolation, and they shall be destroyed with the destructio of the terra.</p>
<p>For the terra is polluted under the habitatores thereof; because they have transgressed the leges, changed the statuta, and broken the foedus sempiternum.</p>
<p>Therefore hath the maledictio devoured the terra, and they that dwell therein are desolate: therefore the habitatores of the terra are extinct, and few homines are left.</p>
