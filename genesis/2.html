                    <p>And the day was finis, and the seventh day God ended his opus, which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his opus, which he had made.</p>
<p>And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his opus, which God created and made.</p>
<p>These are the generations of the caelum and of the terra when they were created, in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens.</p>
<p>And every plant of the field before it was in the terra, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the Lord God had not made it plue and there was not homo to till the terra.</p>
<p>But there went up a vapor from the terra, and watered the whole face of the terra.</p>
<p>And the Lord God formed homo of the dust of the terra, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of vita; and homo became a living anima.</p>
<p>And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the homo whom he had formed.</p>
<p>And out of the terra made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the lignum of vita also in the midst of the garden, and the lignum of scientia of bonum and malum.</p>
<p>And a flumen went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four principale flumina.</p>
<p>The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is aurum;</p>
<p>And the aurum of that land is bonum: there is bdellium and the lapis onyx.</p>
<p>And the name of the second flumen is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>And the name of the third flumen is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth flumen is Euphrates.</p>
<p>And the Lord God took the homo, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.</p>
<p>And the Lord God commanded the homo, saying, Of every lignum of the garden thou mayest freely eat:</p>
<p>But of the lignum of scientia of bonum and malum, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.</p>
<p>And the Lord God said, It is not bonum that the homo should be solus; I will make him an adjutor like unto himself.</p>
<p>And out of the terra the Lord God formed every beast of the field, and every avium of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living anima, that was the name thereof.</p>
<p>And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the avium of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an adjutor like unto himself.</p>
<p>And the Lord God caused a sopor to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his costae, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;</p>
<p>And the costa, which the Lord God had taken from man, made he a mulier, and brought her unto the man.</p>
<p>And Adam said, This is now os ex ossibus meis, and caro ex carne mea: she shall be called Mulier, because she was taken out of Man.</p>
<p>Therefore shall a man leave his pater and his mater, and shall cleave unto his mulier: and they shall be una caro.</p>
<p>And they were both nudi, the man and his mulier, and were not ashamed.</p>
