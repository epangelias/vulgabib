                    <p>1. I will extol thee, O Domine, for thou hast lifted me up, and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me.</p>
<p>2. O Domine my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me.</p>
<p>3. O Domine, thou hast brought up my animus from Infernum: thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to Sepulcrum.</p>
<p>4. Sing unto Domine, O ye sancti of his, and give thanks at the commemoratio of his sanctum Nomen.</p>
<p>5. For his indignatio is but for a moment: in his favorem is vita: weeping may endure for a noctis, but iucunditas cometh in the mane.</p>
<p>6. And in my prosperitas I said, I shall never be moved.</p>
<p>7. Domine, by thy favorem thou hast made my montem of fortitudo to be stabile: thou didst hide thy faciem, and I was troubled.</p>
<p>8. I cried to thee, O Domine, and unto Domine I made supplicatio.</p>
<p>9. What proficio is there in my sanguine, when I descend into Sepulcrum? Shall the pulvis give gratias unto thee? shall it declare thy veritas?</p>
<p>10. Hear, O Domine, and have misericordia unto me: Domine, be thou my adiutor.</p>
<p>11. Thou hast turned for me my luctus into iucunditas: thou hast put off my sacculus, and girded me with laetitia;</p>
<p>12. To the intent that my gloriam may sing iucunditas unto thee, and not be silent. O Domine my God, I will give gratias unto thee for ever.</p>
