                    <p>After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the mare, even to that of Tiberias: and on this wise shewed he himself.</p>
<p>There were together Simon Petrus, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilaea, and the sons of Zebedaeus, and two other of his disciples.</p>
<p>Simon Petrus saith unto them, I go a piscari: they say unto him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a navis, and that night they caught nihil.</p>
<p>But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the terra: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.</p>
<p>Then Jesus saith unto them, Pueri, have ye any pisciculi? They answered him, No.</p>
<p>And he said unto them, Cast the rete on the right side of the navis, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of pisciculi.</p>
<p>Therefore that discipulus whom Jesus loved saith unto Petrus, It is Dominus. Now when Simon Petrus heard that it was Dominus, he girded his tunic about him, for he was nudus, and cast himself into the mare.</p>
<p>And the other disciples came in the navis, for they were not far from terra, but as it were ducenti cubits, dragging the rete of pisciculi.</p>
<p>As soon then as they were come to terra, they saw a prandium prepared, and coals thereon, and pisciculi laid thereon, and panis.</p>
<p>Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the pisciculi which ye have now caught.</p>
<p>Simon Petrus went up, and drew the rete to terra, full of great pisciculi, an hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the rete broken.</p>
<p>Jesus saith unto them, Come, and prandium. And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was Dominus.</p>
<p>Jesus then cometh, and taketh panis, and giveth them, and likewise pisciculi.</p>
<p>This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the mortui.</p>
<p>So when they had prandium, Jesus saith to Simon Petrus, Simon, filius Iona, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Domine: thou knowest that I diligam thee. He saith unto him, Pasce agnellus meos.</p>
<p>He saith to him again the second time, Simon, filius Iona, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Domine: thou knowest that I diligam thee. He saith unto him, Pasce oves meas.</p>
<p>He saith unto him the third time, Simon, filius Iona, diligis me? Petrus was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Diligis me? And he said unto him, Domine, thou knowest all things: thou knowest that I diligam thee. Jesus saith unto him, Pasce oves meas.</p>
<p>Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast iunior, thou girdest thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be senex, thou shalt stretch forth thy manus, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.</p>
<p>This spake he, signifying by what morte he should glorificare Deum. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Sequere me.</p>
<p>Then Petrus, turning about, seeth that discipulus whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his pectus at supper, and said, Domine, who is he that betrayeth thee?</p>
<p>Petrus seeing him saith to Jesus, Domine, and what shall this man do?</p>
<p>Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? sequere me.</p>
<p>Then went this saying abroad among the fratres, that that discipulus dieth not: and Jesus said not unto him, He dieth not; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?</p>
<p>This is that discipulus which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimonium is verum.</p>
<p>And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the mundus itself could not contain the libros that should be written. Amen.</p>
