  "Ahasuerus the king levied a tributum on the land, and on the isles of the sea.",
  "And all the acts of his potestas and of his magnitudo, and the declaration of the dignitas of Mordecai, to which the king advanced him, are they not written in the libros of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?",
  "For Mordecai the Jew was secundus to king Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews, and accepted of the multitude of his fratres, seeking the wealth of his populus, and speaking peace to all his semen."
