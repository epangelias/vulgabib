                    <p>Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ. Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you.</p>
<p>But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is Deus.</p>
<p>Every man praying or prophesying, having his caput covered, dishonoureth his caput.</p>
<p>But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her caput uncovered dishonoureth her caput: for that is even all one as if she were rasus.</p>
<p>For if the woman be not covered, let her also be tonsus: but if it be a shame for a woman to be tonsus or rasus, let her be covered.</p>
<p>For a man indeed ought not to cover his caput, forasmuch as he is the imago and gloria Dei: but the woman is the gloria of the man.</p>
<p>For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man.</p>
<p>Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.</p>
<p>For this cause ought the woman to have potestas on her caput because of the angeli.</p>
<p>Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Domini.</p>
<p>For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things of Deus.</p>
<p>Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto Deus uncovered?</p>
<p>Doth not even natura itself teach you, that, if a man have long capillum, it is a shame unto him?</p>
<p>But if a woman have long capillum, it is a gloria to her: for her capillum is given her for a velamen.</p>
<p>But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such consuetudo, neither the Ecclesiae Dei.</p>
<p>Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse.</p>
<p>For first of all, when ye come together in the Ecclesia, I hear that there be schismata among you; and I partly believe it.</p>
<p>For there must be also haereses among you, that they which are probati may be made manifest among you.</p>
<p>When ye come together therefore into one loco, this is not to eat the Cena Domini.</p>
<p>For in eating every one taketh before other his own Cena: and one is esuriens, and another is ebrius.</p>
<p>What, have ye not domus to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the Ecclesiam Dei, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.</p>
<p>For I have received of the Domine that which also I delivered unto you, That the Domine Iesus in the nocte in qua tradebatur, took panem: And when he had gratias agere, frregit, and said, Take, eat: this is corpus meum, quod pro vobis frangitur: this do in remembrance mei.</p>
<p>After the same manner also he took calicem, when Cena was finita, saying, This calicem is Novum Testamentum in sanguine meo: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance mei.</p>
<p>For as often as ye eat this panem, and drink this calicem, ye do shew the Domini mortem till he come.</p>
<p>Wherefore whosoever shall eat this panem, and drink this calicem of the Domine unworthily, shall be reus corporis et sanguinis Domini.</p>
<p>But let a man examine seipsum, and so let him eat of that panem, and drink of that calicem.</p>
<p>For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnationem to seipso, not discerning corpus Domini.</p>
<p>For this cause many infirmi et debiles among you, and many dormiunt.</p>
<p>For if we would iudicare nosmetipsos, we should not be iudicati.</p>
<p>But when we are iudicati, we are castigati a Domino, that we should not be condemnati cum mundo.</p>
<p>Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.</p>
<p>And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnatio. And the rest will I set in ordine, when I come.</p>
