  "Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which were heard, lest at any time we should let them slip.",
  "For if the word spoken by angelis had been steadfast, and every transgression and disobedientia received a just recompense of reward;",
  "How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvatio, which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard Him;",
  "God also bearing them witness, both with signis and wondrous works, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to His own voluntas;",
  "For unto the angelis hath He not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.",
  "But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that Thou art mindful of him? or the filius hominis, that Thou visitest him?",
  "Thou madest him a little lower than the angelis; Thou crownedst him with gloria and honorem;",
  "And didst set him over the works of Thy manus; Thou hast put all things in subjection under his pedes;",
  "For in that He put all in subjection under him, He left nothing that is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him.",
  "But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angelis for the suffering of death, crowned with gloria and honorem; that He by the gratia of God should taste death for every homo."
