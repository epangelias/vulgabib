  "Thus saith the Dominus unto me; Behold, I will give Pharaoh Hophra rex Aegypti into the manus of his enemies, and into the manus of them that seek his vita.",
  "Then it shall be, when thou hast finished legere this libro, thou shalt bind a petra to it, and cast it into the middle of Euphrates:",
  "Thus saith the Dominus; Behold, that which I have built will I destroy, and that which I have planted I will pluck up, even this whole terra.",
  "And seekest thou magnificare veritatem, or to appareo in exterioribus; for they have not hearkened unto verbum Domini, nor received correction.",
  "And it shall be, when they shall say unto thee, Wherefore doth the Dominus speak thus against this terra? what wickedness is this, that our patres have committed?",
  "Tell them, Because your patres have reliquished the Domini, and served other dii, and worshipped them, and served them; therefore hath the Dominus reliquished you."
