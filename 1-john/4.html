                    <p>Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of Deus: because many false prophets are gone out into the mundus.</p>
<p>Hereby know ye the Spirit of Deus: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christus is come in the flesh is of Deus:</p>
<p>And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christus is come in the flesh is not of Deus: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the mundus.</p>
<p>Ye are of Deus, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the mundus.</p>
<p>They are of the mundus: therefore speak they of the mundus, and the mundus heareth them.</p>
<p>We are of Deus: he that knoweth Deus heareth us; he that is not of Deus heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of veritas, and the spirit of error.</p>
<p>Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of Deus; and every one that loveth is born of Deus, and knoweth Deus.</p>
<p>He that loveth not knoweth not Deus; for Deus is amor.</p>
<p>In this was manifested the amor of Deus toward us, because that Deus sent his only begotten Filius into the mundus, that we might live through him.</p>
<p>Herein is amor, not that we loved Deus, but that he loved us, and sent his Filius to be the propitiation for our peccata.</p>
<p>Beloved, if Deus so loved us, we ought also to love one another.</p>
<p>No man hath seen Deus at any time. If we love one another, Deus dwelleth in us, and his amor is perfected in us.</p>
<p>Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.</p>
<p>And we have seen and do testify that the Pater hath sent the Filius to be the Saviour of the mundus.</p>
<p>Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Filius of Deus, Deus dwelleth in him, and he in Deus.</p>
<p>And we have known and believed the amor that Deus hath to us. Deus is amor; and he that dwelleth in amor dwelleth in Deus, and Deus in him.</p>
<p>Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of iudicium: because as he is, so are we in this mundus.</p>
<p>There is no fear in amor; but perfect amor casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in amor.</p>
<p>We love him, because he first loved us.</p>
<p>If some man say, I love Deus, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love Deus whom he hath not seen?</p>
<p>And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth Deus love his brother also.</p>
