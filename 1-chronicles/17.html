                    <p>And it came to pass, as David sat in his domus, that David said to Nathan propheta, Lo, I dwell in an domus of cedars, but the arca of foedus Dominus remaineth under tentorium.</p>
<p>Then Nathan propheta said unto David, Do all that is in thine cor, for Deus is with thee.</p>
<p>And it came to pass that nocte, that verbum Domini venit ad Nathan, saying,</p>
<p>Go and tell David my servus, Thus saith Dominus, Thou shalt not aedificare me an domus to dwell in;</p>
<p>for I have not dwelt in an domus since the die that I brought up the filii Israel out of Aegyptus unto this diem, but have walked in tabernaculum, and in tentorium.</p>
<p>In all the places wherein I have walked with omnibus Israel, spake I a word with any of the iudices of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my populus, saying, Why have ye not aedificatum me an domus of cedars?</p>
<p>Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servus David, Thus saith Dominus exercituum, I took thee from the ovium, and from following the greges, to be dux over my populus Israel;</p>
<p>And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and have destroyed all thine inimici out of thy faciem, and have made thee an nomen, like unto the nomen of the magni that are in terra;</p>
<p>Moreover I will appoint a locum for my populum Israel, and will plantar them, that they may dwell in a domus of their own, and move no more; neither shall the filii wicked afflict them any more, as beforetime,</p>
<p>And as since the die that I commanded iudices to be over my populum Israel, and have caused thee to rest from omnibus inimicis. Also Dominus tibi significat, that he will make thee an domus.</p>
<p>And when thy dies be fulfilled, and thou shalt somnus with patres, I will aedificare thy semen after thee, which shall proceed out of thy ventrem, and I will aedificare his regnum.</p>
<p>He shall aedificare me an domus, and I will stablish his thronus for semper.</p>
<p>I will be his pater, and he shall be my filius. And I will not take away my gratia from him, as I took it from him that was before thee:</p>
<p>But I will settle him in mine domus and in my regnum for semper: and his thronus shall be stablished for sempermore.</p>
<p>According to all these verba, and according to all this visio, so Nathan propheta spake unto David.</p>
