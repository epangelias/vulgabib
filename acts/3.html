                    <p>Now Peter and John went up together into the templum at the hora of oration, being the nona hora.</p>
<p>And a certain vir, lame from his mater's uterus, was carried, whom they laid daily at the porta of the templum, which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the templum;</p>
<p>Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the templum, asked an alms.</p>
<p>And Peter, fastening his oculi upon him with John, said, Look on us.</p>
<p>And he gave them attention, expecting to receive something from them.</p>
<p>Then Peter said, Silver and aurum have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the nomine of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.</p>
<p>And he took him by the dexter manus, and lifted him up: and immediately his pedes and ankle bones received fortitudo:</p>
<p>And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the templum, walking, and leaping, and praising Deum.</p>
<p>And all the populus saw him walking and praising Deum:</p>
<p>And they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the porta of the templum, which is called Beautiful: and they were filled with admiratio and gaudeo at that which had happened unto him.</p>
<p>And as the vir which was healed held Peter and John, all the populus ran together unto them in the porticus, which is called Solomon's, greatly wondering.</p>
<p>And when Peter saw it, he responded to the populus, Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own virtus or pietas we had made this vir to walk?</p>
<p>The Deus of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the Deus of our patres, hath glorified his Son Jesus; whom ye delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilatus, when he was determined to release him.</p>
<p>But ye denied the Sanctus and the Justus, and desired a homicida to be granted unto you;</p>
<p>And killed the Prince of vita, whom Deus hath raised from the dead; whereof we are testes.</p>
<p>And his nomine through faith in his nomine hath made this vir strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by him hath given him this perfectio in the presence of you all.</p>
<p>And now, fratres, I wot that through ignorance ye did it, as did also your principes.</p>
<p>But those things, which Deus before had shewed by the os of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled.</p>
<p>Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your peccata may be blotted out, when the tempora of refrigerio shall come from the facie of the Deus:</p>
<p>And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you:</p>
<p>Whom the caelum must receive until the tempora of restitution of all things, which Deus hath spoken by the os of all his sancti prophets since the mundi was.</p>
<p>For Moses truly said unto the patres, A prophet shall the Deus raise up unto you of your fratres, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you.</p>
<p>And it shall come to pass, that every anima, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the populus.</p>
<p>Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these dies.</p>
<p>Ye are the filii of the prophets, and of the covenant which Deus made with our patres, saying unto Abraham, And in thy semen shall all the kindreds of the terra be blessed.</p>
<p>Unto you first Deus, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away every unum of you from his iniquitates.</p>
