  "Paulus, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the ecclesia of the Thessalonians in Deo Patri, and in Domino Jesu Christo, gratia vobis, et pax.",
  "We give thanks to Deus, semper pro omnibus vobis, making mention of you in orationes nostrae;",
  "remembering without cessatio the work of fide, and labour of amor, and patientiam spei, in Domino Jesu Christo, in sight of Deus et Patri;",
  "Knowing, brethren dilecti, your electio Dei;",
  "For our gospel was not unto you in sermone alone, but also in virtute, and in Spiritu Sancto, and in plenitudine fidei;",
  "as ye know what kind of hommes we were among you for your sake;",
  "And you became imitatores nostri, and of Domino, receiving the word in tribulatione multa, with joy of Spiritu Sancto;",
  "so that ye were ensamples to all that credidistis in Macedonia and in Achaia;",
  "For from you sounded out the word of Domino, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every loco, your fides ad Deum is spread abroad;",
  "so that we need not to speak any thing;",
  "For they themselves shew of us what entrance we had unto you, and how ye turned to Deum from idolis, to serve the Deus vivum, and verum;",
  "And to wait for his Filium from caelis, whom he raised from mortuis, even Jesus, who delivered us from wrath ventura."
