  "He therefore that rejecteth, rejecteth not homo (man), but Deus (God), who hath also given unto us the Spiritum (Spirit) of gratia (grace);",
  "But we pray always for you, that our Deus (God) would count you worthy of this vocatio (calling), and fulfill all the voluntas (will) of his bonitas (goodness), and the operatio (operation) of the fides (faith) with potentia (power);",
  "That the nomine (name) of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the gratia (grace) of our Deus (God) and of the Lord Jesus Christ."
