                    <p>God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in antiquis temporibus to the fathers by the prophets,</p>
<p>2 Hath in hac ultima aetate spoken unto us by the Filium, whom he hath appointed heres of all things, by whom also he made the saecula.</p>
<p>3 Who being the splendor of his gloria, and the figura of his substantia, and sustaining all things by the verbum of his virtus, when he had by himself purged our peccata, sat down on the dexteram of the Majesty in excelsis,</p>
<p>4 Being made so much better than the angeli, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent nomen than they.</p>
<p>5 For unto which of the angeli said he at any time, Filius meus es tu, ego hodie te generavi? or again, I will be to him a Pater, and he shall be to me a Filius?</p>
<p>6 And again, when he bringeth in the primogenitus into the orbis terrarum, he saith, And let all the angeli of Deus adore him.</p>
<p>7 And of the angeli he saith, Qui facit angelos suos spiritus, et ministros suos ignem ardentem.</p>
<p>8 But unto the Filium he saith, Thy thronus, O Deus, is in saeculum saeculi; a sceptre of iustitia is the sceptre of thy regnum.</p>
<p>9 Thou hast loved iustitia, and hated iniquitatem; therefore Deus, thy Deus, hath anointed thee with oleo laetitiae above thy fellows.</p>
<p>10 And, Thou, Lord, in principio fundasti terram; and the caeli, opera manuum tuarum;</p>
<p>11 They shall perish; but thou permanebis; and they all shall grow vetustas like a vestimentum;</p>
<p>12 And as a vestimentum thou shalt change them, and they shall be changed; but tu es idem, and thy annus shall not finis.</p>
<p>13 But to which of the angeli hath he said, Sede a dextris meis, until I make thy inimicos thy footstool?</p>
<p>14 Are they not all ministering spiritus, sent to minister for them who shall be heredes of salus?</p>
