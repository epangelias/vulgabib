                    <p>And Josiah was eight years old when he began to regnare, and he regnavit one and thirty years in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>And he did that which was rectus in the eyes of the Domini, and walked in all the ways of David his pater, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left.</p>
<p>For in the eighth anno of his regnum, while he was yet juvenile, he began to quaerere the Deum of his pater David: and in the twelfth anno he began to emundare Judah and Jerusalem from the altaria of the gentium, and the luci, and the idola, and the figuras conflatas.</p>
<p>Now in the eighteenth anno of his regnum, when he had purgare the terram and the domum, he sent Shaphan the filius of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the dux of the civitas, and Joah the filius of Joahaz the recorder, to reparare the domum of the Domini his Deus.</p>
<p>They gave it to the operarii, and to the artifices, to purchase lapides quadratos, and ligna, to repair the domus, and to universa, quae essent destructa.</p>
<p>And they gave the argentum to the operarii, and the artifices, and they emerunt lapides et ligna, and they reficiebant universa, quae essent destructa, and the rest of the argentum was given to the operarii and artifices.</p>
<p>Also they restored the vasorum aureorum and argenteorum, quae rex Aegypti had taken out of the domo Domini in the tempore of Hezekiah, filius of Ahaz, rex of Judah, and gave them a Shiloh.</p>
<p>The servientes therefore and the artifices worked in the opere, and the Levitae praesidentes and the prophetae supervidentes.</p>
<p>When they had demolire the domus, the servientes and the Levitae, qui supervidebant the opere, and they inventum a liber, which Helias the propheta had spoken.</p>
<p>Go and tell the rex, quae sic dicit the Domini: quia vidisti universa malitia, quae patrarunt patres eorum in Judah et Jerusalem, ideo dedi Judah and Jerusalem in desolationem et exterminium, quia me derelinquerunt et sacrificaverunt diis alienis.</p>
<p>And he ita: Ecce, ego legam liber in Jerusalem and Judah and Benjamin.</p>
<p>Thus did Josias to Jerusalem in Jerusalem, in Judah and in Benjamin and in monte Ephraim, et Sichar et Asabbon et Negeb et filii Chanaan and omnis, qui in terram fuerant repatriati ab omni latere in terra Israel and reversi fuerunt, omnes filii Israel in civitate sua, ut audirent legem.</p>
<p>The rex, and the maiores natu and the Judices, et universus populus de minimo usque ad maximum, steterunt et audierunt librum legis, et in lectulo lecto populo in aula palatii per ostium Novi in domo Domini.</p>
<p>The rex ita, statuite unius, and fecerunt lectus lectus ab ligno cedro and in eodem positum librum and venerunt ante eum omnes majores natu, Judices and scribae et populus and ab exiguo usque ad maximum omnes et legent, coram omni populo and ipse in aula domus Domini in monte and ostium aedium templi aedium regiae ab ostium dexteriora lecti regii.</p>
