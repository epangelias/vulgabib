  "O Lord God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before thee:",
  "Let my prayer come before thee: incline thine auris to my clamor;",
  "For my animus is full of calamitates: and my vita draweth nigh unto mortem.",
  "I am counted with them that descend into lacus: I am as a homo that hath no virtus:",
  "Free among the mortui, like the interfecti, that lie in sepulchre, whom thou rememberest no more: and they are cut off from thy manus.",
  "Thou hast laid me in the lowest lacus, in obscuris, in profundis.",
  "Thy indignatio lieth hard upon me, and thou hast increased all thy fluctus over me. Selah.",
  "Thou hast put away mine amici far from me; thou hast made me an abomination unto them: I am shut up, and I cannot come forth.",
  "Mine oculus mourneth by reason of affliction: Lord, I have called daily upon thee, I have stretched out my manus unto thee.",
  "Shall thy mirabilia be known in the tenebris? and thy iustitia in the terra oblivionis?",
  "Lord, why castest thou off my animus? why hidest thou thy faciem from me?",
  "I am afflicted and ready to mortem from my iuventus up: while I suffer thy terrores, I am distracted.",
  "Thy furores go over me; thy terrores have cut me off; they came round about me like aquae all the day long; they compassed me about together.",
  "Lover and amicus hast thou put far from me, and mine amici into caligo."
