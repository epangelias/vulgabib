                    <p>Hear, ye filii, the instruction of a pater, and attend to know understanding.</p>
<p>For I give you doctina bona, forsake not my disciplina.</p>
<p>For I was a filius to my pater, tender and unicus in the sight of my mater.</p>
<p>He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thy cor take hold of my verbum, keep my mandata, and live.</p>
<p>Get sapientia, get intelligentia: forget it not; neither decline from the words of my os.</p>
<p>Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and she shall keep thee.</p>
<p>Sapientia is the prima, get sapientia: and with all thy facultas get understanding.</p>
<p>Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to honorem, when thou dost embrace her.</p>
<p>She shall give to thy caput an ornament of gratia: an aureus circlet she shall give to thy head.</p>
<p>Hear, O filius, and receive my verbum; and the anni of thy vita shall be multiplied.</p>
<p>I have taught thee in the via of sapientia; I have led thee in rectis semitis.</p>
<p>When thou goest, thy gressus shall not be restricted; and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.</p>
<p>Take hold of doctrina, let her not go: keep her; for she is tua vita.</p>
<p>Enter not the via of impii, and walk not in the semita of maliciousi.</p>
<p>Avoid it, passe non per eam, decline from it, and passe on.</p>
<p>For they sleep not, nisi they have done malum; and their somnus is taken away, nisi they cause some to fall.</p>
<p>For they eat panis iniquitatis, and bibunt vinum violentiae.</p>
<p>But the semita of iusti is as lux splendens, that shineth more and more unto diei perfectum.</p>
<p>The via of impii is as tenebrae; they know not at what lapidem they shall stumble.</p>
<p>My filius, attend to my verbum; incline thine aurem to my eloquia.</p>
<p>Let them not decline from thine oculi, keep them in medio cordis tui.</p>
<p>For they are vita to those that find them, and sanitas to all their carne.</p>
<p>Keep thy cor with all diligencia; for out of it are the exitus of vita.</p>
<p>Put away from thee a lingua dolosum, and perditious labia, put far from thee.</p>
<p>Let thine oculi look recte on; and let thine palpebrae look recte before thee.</p>
<p>Ponder the semita of thy pedes, and let all thy viae be stabiles.</p>
<p>Decline not to dexteram aut sinistram; remove thy pedem from malum.</p>
