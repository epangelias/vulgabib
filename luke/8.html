                    <p>And it came to pass afterward, that he went into a citie, called Nain; and his discipuli went with him, and much people.</p>
<p>Now when he came nigh to the gate of the citie, behold, there was a dead corpus, the filius of a widow: and many people of the citie were with her.</p>
<p>And when the Dominus saw her, he had compassio on her, and said unto her, Weep not.</p>
<p>And he came and touched the lectus: and they that bare him stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.</p>
<p>And he that was dead sat up, and began to loqui. And he delivered him to his mater.</p>
<p>And there came a fear on all: and they glorified Deum, saying, That a great propheta is risen up among us; and, That Deus hath visited his people.</p>
<p>And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and throughout all the region round about.</p>
<p>And the discipuli of John shewed him of all these things.</p>
<p>And John calling unto him two of his discipuli sent them to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?</p>
<p>When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?</p>
<p>And in that same hora he cured many of their languores and plagas, and of evil spirits; and unto many that were caeci he gave visum.</p>
<p>Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the caeci see, the claudi walk, the leprosi are cleansed, the surdi hear, the mortui rise, to the pauperes the evangelium is preached.</p>
<p>And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be scandalized in me.</p>
<p>And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the desert to see? A reed shaken with the ventus?</p>
<p>But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft vestibus? Behold, they which are in kingly vestibus and delicie live in kingly courts.</p>
<p>But what went ye out for to see? A propheta? Yea, I say unto you, and more than a propheta.</p>
<p>This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my angel before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.</p>
<p>For I say unto you, Among those that are nati of women there is not a greater propheta than John the Baptist: but he that is minimus in the regnum Dei is greater than he.</p>
<p>And all the people that heard him, and the publicani, justified Deus, being baptized with the baptism of John.</p>
<p>But the pharisei and lawyers rejected the consilium Dei against themselves, being not baptized of him.</p>
<p>And the Dominus said, Whereunto then shall I liken the homines of this generatio? and to what are they like?</p>
<p>They are like children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not lamented.</p>
<p>For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking vinum; and ye say, He hath daemonium.</p>
<p>The filius hominis is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a man gluttonus and vinolentus, a friend of publicani and peccatores.</p>
<p>But sapientia is justified of all her filii.</p>
<p>And one of the pharisei desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the pharisei's domus, and sat down to mensa.</p>
<p>And, behold, a mulier in the citie, which was a peccatrix, when she knew that Jesus sat at mensa in the pharisei's domus, she brought an alabaster box of unguentum.</p>
<p>And stood at his pedes behind him weeping, and began to wash his pedes with lacrimis, and did wipe them with the hairs of her caput, and kissed his pedes, and anointed them with the unguentum.</p>
<p>Now when the pharisei which had invited him saw it, he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a propheta, would have known who and what manner of mulier this is that toucheth him: for she is a peccatrix.</p>
<p>And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on.</p>
<p>There was a certain creditor which had two debitores: the one owed him quingentos denarii, and the other quinquaginta.</p>
<p>And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?</p>
<p>Simon answered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.</p>
<p>And he turned to the mulier, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this mulier? I entered into thine domus, thou gavest me no aqua for my pedes: but she hath washed my pedes with lacrimis, and wiped them with the hairs of her caput.</p>
<p>Thou gavest me no osculum: but this mulier since the hora she came in hath not ceased to kiss my pedes.</p>
<p>My caput with oleum thou didst not anoint: but this mulier hath anointed my pedes with unguentum.</p>
<p>Wherefore I say unto thee, Her peccata, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little.</p>
<p>And he said unto her, Thy peccata are forgiven.</p>
<p>And they that sat at mensa with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth peccata also?</p>
<p>And he said to the mulier, Thy fides hath saved thee; go in pace.</p>
