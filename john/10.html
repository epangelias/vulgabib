                    <p>Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the porta of the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a fur and a latro.</p>
<p>But he that entereth in by the porta, he is the pastor of the ovium.</p>
<p>To him the janitor openeth; and the ovium audiunt his vocem: and he calleth his own ovium by nomine, and leadeth them out.</p>
<p>When he putteth forth his own ovium, he goeth before them, and the ovium follow him: for they know his vocem.</p>
<p>And a stranger they will not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the vocem of strangers.</p>
<p>This similitudo spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them.</p>
<p>Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the porta of the ovium.</p>
<p>All that ever came before me are fur and latrones: but the ovium did not audiunt them.</p>
<p>I am the porta: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pascua.</p>
<p>The fur cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have vita, and that they might have it more abundantly.</p>
<p>I am the bonus pastor: the bonus pastor giveth his anima for the ovium.</p>
<p>But he that is a mercennarius, and not the pastor, whose own the ovium are not, seeth the lupum coming, and leaveth the ovium, and fleeth: and the lupus catcheth them, and scattereth the ovium.</p>
<p>The mercennarius fleeth, because he is mercennarius, and careth not for the ovium.</p>
<p>I am the bonus pastor, and know mine ovium, and mine ovium know me,</p>
<p>Even as the Pater knoweth me, and I know the Pater: and I lay down my anima for the ovium.</p>
<p>And other ovium I have, which are not of this ovili: them also I must bring, and they shall audiunt my vocem; and there shall be one ovile, and one pastor.</p>
<p>Therefore doth the Pater amare me, because I lay down my anima, that I might take it again.</p>
<p>No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have potestas to lay it down, and I have potestas to take it again. This mandatum have I received of my Pater.</p>
<p>Therefore said the Judaei, and his discipluli, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?</p>
<p>Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the opera which I do in nomine Patris mei, they bear witness of me.</p>
<p>But ye believe not, because ye are not of my ovium, as I said unto you.</p>
<p>My ovium audiunt my vocem, and I know them, and they follow me:</p>
<p>And I give them vita aeterna; and they shall never perire, neither shall any man pluck them out of my manus.</p>
<p>My Pater, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Pater's manus.</p>
<p>I and my Pater unum sumus.</p>
<p>Therefore the Judaei sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their manus,</p>
<p>And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he abode.</p>
<p>And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no signum: but all things that John spake of this man were vera.</p>
<p>And many believed in him there.</p>
