  "But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry, and he prayed unto the Dominus, and said, I prayed unto thee, O Dominus, was not this my saying, when I was yet in mea terra?",
  "Therefore I fled before unto Tharsis: for I knew that thou art Deus gracilis, and misericors, slow to ira, and of great clementia, and repentest thee of malum.",
  "And now, O Dominus, take, I beseech thee, my anima from me; for it is melior for me to mori than to vivere.",
  "Then said the Dominus, Doest thou well to be angry for the colocyntha? And he said, I do well to be angry, even unto mors.",
  "So Jonah went out of the civitas, and sate on the orientalem part of the civitas, and there made sibi a tabernaculum, and sate under it in the umbra, till he might see what would become of the civitas.",
  "And the Dominus Deus prepared a colocyntha, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be an umbra over his caput, to deliver him from his malum. Now Jonah was exceeding glad of the colocyntha.",
  "But Deus prepared a vermis, and it smote the colocyntha, that it withered.",
  "And it came to pass, when the sol arose, that Deus prepared a vehementis ventus orientalem; and the sol beat upon the caput of Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in his anima to mori, and said, It is melior for me to mori than to vivere.",
  "And Deus said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the colocyntha? And he said, I do well to be angry, even unto mors.",
  "Then said the Dominus, Thou hast had pietas for the colocyntha, for the which thou hast not labored, neither madest it grow; which came up in a nocte, and perished in a nocte:",
  "And should not I spare Nineve, that great civitas, wherein are more than centum quinquaginta milia hominum, that cannot discernere between their dexter and sinister manus; and also much pecus?"
