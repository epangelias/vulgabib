                    <p>And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how he had slain all the prophets with the gladius.</p>
<p>Then Jezebel sent a nuntius to Elijah, saying, So let the dei do to me, and more also, if I make not thy vita as the vita of one of them by to-morrow about this tempus.</p>
<p>And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his vita, and came to Beersheba, which belongeth to Judah, and left his servus there.</p>
<p>But he himself went a diebus journey into the desert, and came and sat down under a juniperus tree: and he requested for himself that he might die, and said, It is enough now, O Domine, take away my vita; for I am not better than my patres.</p>
<p>And as he lay and slept under a juniperus tree, behold, then an angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise and eat.</p>
<p>And he looked, and, behold, there was a cake baken on the coals, and a cratere of aqua at his head. And he did eat and drink, and laid him down again.</p>
<p>And the angel of Domine came again the secundus time, and touched him, and said, Arise and eat; because the journey is too great for thee.</p>
<p>And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meat forty diebus and forty noctes unto Horeb the montem of Deus.</p>
<p>And he came thither unto a spelunca, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of Domine came to him, and he said unto him, What doest thou here, Elijah?</p>
<p>And he said, I have been very jealous for Domine Deus of the exercitus; because the children of Israel have forsaken thy foedus, thrown down thine altaria, and slain thy prophets with the gladius; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my vita, to take it away.</p>
<p>And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the montem before Domine. And, behold, Domine passed by, and a great and strong ventus rent the montes, and brake in pieces the rocks before Domine; but Domine was not in the ventus: and after the ventus an earthquake; but Domine was not in the earthquake:</p>
<p>And after the earthquake a ignis; but Domine was not in the ignis: and after the ignis a still small vox.</p>
<p>And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his facies in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entrance of the spelunca. And, behold, there came a vox unto him, and said, What doest thou here, Elijah?</p>
<p>And he said, I have been very jealous for Domine Deus of the exercitus; because the children of Israel have forsaken thy foedus, thrown down thine altaria, and slain thy prophets with the gladius; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my vita, to take it away.</p>
<p>And Domine said unto him, Go, return on thy via to the desert of Damascus: and when thou comest, anoint Hazael to be rex over Syria:</p>
<p>And Jehu the filius of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be rex over Israel: and Elisha the filius of Shaphat of Abelmeholah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room.</p>
<p>And it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth the gladius of Hazael shall Jehu slay: and him that escapeth from the gladius of Jehu shall Elisha slay.</p>
<p>Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every os which hath not kissed him.</p>
<p>So he departed thence, and found Elisha the filius of Shaphat, who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth: and Elijah passed by him, and cast his mantle upon him.</p>
<p>And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss my pater and my mater, and then I will follow thee. And he said unto him, Go back again: for what have I done to thee?</p>
<p>And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their carnes with the instruments of the oxen, and gave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered unto him.</p>
