  "And when he was come to vs, he took Paulis girdle, and bound his owne hands and feete, and sayd, Thus sayth the Spiritus Sanctus, So shall the Iudaei at Hierusalem binde the man that owneth this girdle, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.",
  "When we heard these sayings, we besought him, saying, Go not vp to Hierusalem.",
  "Then Paul answered, What mean ye to weepe and to breake mine heart? for I am ready not to be bound onely, but also to die at Hierusalem for the nomen of the Dominus Iesus.",
  "And when he would not be perswaded, we ceassed, saying, The voluntas Dei be done.",
  "And after those dayes, we took vp our carriages and went vp to Hierusalem.",
  "There went with vs also some of the disciples of Caesarea, and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge.",
  "And when we were come to Hierusalem, the brethren receiued vs gladly.",
  "On the morrow, Paul went in with vs vnto Iames, and all the Elders were present.",
  "When he had saluted them, he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministerium.",
  "And when they heard it, they glorified the Dominus, and sayd vnto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousandes of Iewes there are which beleeue, and they are all zealous of the Legem.",
  "Now they haue heard of thee, that thou teachest all the Iewes which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcidere their children, neither to walke after the consuetudines.",
  "What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together: for they shall heare that thou art come.",
  "Do therefore this that we say to thee: We haue foure men which haue a vow on them.",
  "Them take, and purifie thy selfe with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shauen their heades: and all shall know that those things whereof they were informed concerning thee are nothing, but that thou thy selfe also walkest orderly, and keepest the Legem.",
  "As touching the Gentiles which beleeue, we haue written and concluded that they obserue no such thing, but that they keepe themselues from things offered to idoles, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication.",
  "Then Paul tooke the men, and the next day purifying himselfe with them, entered into the temple, to signifie the accomplishment of the dayes of purification, vntill an offering should be offered for euery one of them.",
  "And when the seuen dayes were almost ended, the Iewes which were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred vp all the people, and laide hands on him.",
  "Crying out, Men of Israel, helpe: This is the man that teacheth all men euery where against the people, and the Legem, and this place, and further brought Greeks also into the temple, and hath polluted this holy place.",
  "For they had seene before with him in the citie, Trophimus an Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.",
  "And all the citie was mooued, and the people ran together, and tooke Paul, and drew him out of the temple, and foorth with drew him from the temple, and immediatly the doores were shut.",
  "And as they went about to kil him, tidings came to the Tribune of the band, that all Hierusalem was in an vprore.",
  "Who immediatly tooke souldiers and Centurions, and ran downe vnto them, and when they saw the Tribune and the souldiers, they left beating Paul.",
  "Then the Tribune came, and tooke him, and commanded him to be bound with two chaines, and demanded who he was, and what he had done."
