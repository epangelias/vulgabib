                    <p>Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretched forth the manus, and answered for himself:</p>
<p>I think myself felix, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this die, against all the accusation of the Iudaei:</p>
<p>Especially because I know thee to be expert in all questions of the Iudaei and the mos of them: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.</p>
<p>My manner of vita from my iuventus, which was at the first among mine own gentem at Hierosolyma, know all the Iudaei;</p>
<p>Who knew me from the principio, if they would testify, that after the mos of the Pharisaici I lived a Pharisaicus.</p>
<p>And now I stand and am iudicatus for the spes of the promissio made of Deus unto our patres:</p>
<p>Unto which promissio our duodecim tribus, serving God night and die, hope to attain. And for this hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Iudaei.</p>
<p>Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that Deus should raise the mortui?</p>
<p>I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many contraria to the nomine of Iesus of Nazareth.</p>
<p>Which thing I also did in Hierosolyma: and many of the sancti I shut up in carceres, having received autoritas from the principes of the sacerdotes, and when they were put to mors, I gave my vox.</p>
<p>And I punished them oft in every synagoga, and compelled them to blasphemare; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto exteriores civitates.</p>
<p>At the middle of the die, O king, I saw in the via a lux from caelum, above the claritas of the sol, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me.</p>
<p>When we were all fallen to terra, I heard a vox speaking unto me, and saying in the lingua of the Hebraei, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the stimuli.</p>
<p>And I said, Who art thou, Domine? And he said, I am Iesus whom thou persecutest.</p>
<p>But rise, and stand upon thy pedes: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpus, to make thee a minister and a testis both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee;</p>
<p>Delivering thee from the populus of the Iudaei, and from the gentes, unto whom now I send thee,</p>
<p>To open their oculi, and to turn them from tenebris to lux, and from the potestas of Satan unto Deus, that they may receive remissio of peccata, and inheritance among them which are sanctificati by fide in me.</p>
<p>Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the caelestis visio:</p>
<p>But shewed first unto them of Damascum, and at Hierosolyma, and throughout all the region of Iudaea, and then to the gentes, that they should paenitentiam agere, and turn to Deus, doing works digna of paenitentia.</p>
<p>For these causes the Iudaei caught me in the templum, and went about to kill me.</p>
<p>Having therefore obtained help of Deus, I continue unto this die, witnessing both to the parvus and to the magnus, saying none other things than those which the propheti and Moyses did say should come:</p>
<p>That Christus should suffer, and that he should be the primus of the resurrection of the mortui, and should show lux to the populus, and to the gentes.</p>
<p>And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a magna vox, Paul, thou art furiosus; thy doctrina and thy multa scriptura hath made thee insane.</p>
<p>But he said, I am not furiosus, most excellent Festus; but speak forth the vox of veritas and sobrietas.</p>
<p>For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner.</p>
<p>King Agrippa, believest thou the propheti? I know that thou believest.</p>
<p>Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christianus.</p>
<p>And Paul said, I would to Deus, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this die, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these vincula.</p>
<p>And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them:</p>
<p>And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doth nothing worthy of mors or vincula.</p>
<p>Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been released, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.</p>
