  "The burden of the desert of the sea. As whirlwinds in the south pass through; so it cometh from the desert, from a terrifyng land.",
  "A grievous vision is declared unto me; the spoiler spoileth, and the destroyer destroyeth. Go up, O Elam: besiege, O Media; all the sighing thereof have I made to cease.",
  "Therefore are my loins filled with pain: pangs have taken hold upon me, as the pangs of a woman that travaileth: I was bowed down at the hearing of it; I was dismayed at the seeing of it.",
  "And he saw a chariot with a couple of horsemen, a chariot of asses, and a chariot of camels; and he hearkened diligently with much attendo.",
  "And he cried, A lion: My lord, I stand continually upon the watchtower in the daytime, and I am set in my ward whole nights:",
  "And he answered and said, Fallen, fallen is Babylon; and all the graven images of her gods he hath broken unto the terra.",
  "All ye, assemble yourselves, and hear; which among them hath declared these things? The Lord hath loved him: he will execute his furorem upon Babylon, and his manus upon the Chaldeans.",
  "O thou destroyer of the Medes, and the spoiler of the terrae, how hath the oppressor ceased! the gold and the argent is ceased!",

  "In their streets they shall gird themselves with sackcloth: on the tops of their houses, and in their streets, every one shall howl, he descendeth with weeping.",
  "And Heshbon shall cry, and Elealeh: their voice shall be heard even unto Jahaz: therefore the armed soldiers of Moab shall cry out; his animus shall be grievous unto him.",
  "My heart shall cry out for Moab; his fugitives shall flee unto Zoar, an heifer of three years old: for by the mounting up of Luhith with weeping shall they go it up; for in the way of Horonaim they shall raise up a cry of destruction.",
  "For the waters of Nimrim shall be desolate: for the herba is withered away, the floris is decayed, and the fructus is failed.",
  "And they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and shall lament thee, saying, What city is like Tyrus, like the destroyed in the midst of the mare?",
  "The burden of the desert of the sea. As whirlwinds in the south pass through; so it cometh from the desert, from a terrifyng land."
