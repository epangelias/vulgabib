  "Be merciful unto me, O Deus, be merciful unto me: for my animus trusteth in thee: yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge, until these calamitates be overpast.",
  "I will cry unto Deus most High; unto Deus that performeth all things for me.",
  "He shall send from coelum to save me from the reproach of him that would swallow me up. Selah. Deus shall send forth his clementia and veritas.",
  "My animus is among lions: and I lie even among them that are set on fire, even the filii hominum, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their lingua a sharp gladius.",
  "Be thou exalted, O Deus, above the coelum; let thy gloria be above all the terra.",
  "They have prepared a rete for my steps; my animus is bowed down: they have digged a fovea before me, into the midst whereof they are fallen themselves. Selah.",
  "Quia Deus is my fortitudo, I will trust in him: Deus is my Deus; I will trust in him.",
  "I will praise thy nomine for ever and ever.",
  "For he hath delivered me out of all my afflictiones, and mine oculi have seen his desiderium upon mine inimici."
