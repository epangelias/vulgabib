                    <p>The vision of Obadiah. Thus saith Dominus Deus concerning Edom; We have heard a rumour from Dominus, and an ambassador is sent among the gentes, Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in proelium.</p>
<p>Behold, I have made thee small among gentes: thou art greatly despised.</p>
<p>The superbia of thine cor shall deceive thee, thou that dwellest in the clefts of the petra, whose habitatio is high; that saith in cor suo, Who shall descend against me?</p>
<p>Though thou exalt thyself as aquila, and though thou set thy nidus among stellas, thence will I bring thee down, saith Dominus.</p>
<p>If fures come to thee, if devastatores by nocte, (how art thou cut off!) shall they not steal till they have enough? if vindemiatores come to thee, would they not leave some germen?</p>
<p>How are the res of Esau searched out! how are his thesauri sought up!</p>
<p>All the viatores of thy populus shall drive thee from thy portis: yea, they that were at peace with thee shall deceive thee, and prevail against thee; they that eat thy panem shall lay a fraudulenta laqueus under thee: there is non sapientia in him.</p>
<p>Shall I not in die illa, saith Dominus, destroy the sapientes out of Edom, and understanding out of monte Esau?</p>
<p>And thy valentes, O Teman, shall be dismayed, to the end that every one of monte Esau may be cut off by interitum.</p>
<p>For violence against fratrem tuum Jacob, shame shall cover thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever.</p>
<p>In the die when thou stoodest against him, when alieni took captive his exercitus, and strangers entered into his portas, and cast sortes upon Ierusalem, thou wast as one of them.</p>
<p>But thou shouldest not have looked on the die of fratrem tuum in the die of his infortunium; neither shouldest thou have spoken against the populus of Iudah in the die of his afflictio.</p>
<p>Neither shouldest thou have stood in the via, to cut off those that escaped; neither shouldest thou have shut up the remnant in the die of angustia.</p>
<p>For the dies of Dominus are nigh upon all gentes: as thou hast done, it shall be done to thee: thy reward shall return upon thine caput.</p>
<p>For as thou hast drunk upon mons sanctus, all gentes shall drink continually; yea, they shall drink, and they shall swallow down, and they shall be as though they had not been.</p>
<p>But in monte Sion shall be deliverance, and there shall be sanctuarium; and the domus of Iacob shall possess their hereditas.</p>
<p>And the domus of Iacob shall be ignis, and the domus of Ioseph flammas, and the domus of Esau stubble, and they shall kindle in them, and devour them; and there shall not be any remaining of the domus of Esau; for Dominus hath spoken it.</p>
<p>And they of the meridies shall possess montem Esau; and they of the campo shall possess Philisthim, and they shall possess the campo of Ephraim, and the campo of Samaria: and Beniamin shall possess Gilead.</p>
<p>And the captivity of this exercitus of the filii of Israel shall possess that of the Canaanites, even unto Sarepta; and the captivity of Ierusalem, which is in Sepharad, shall possess the civitates of the meridies.</p>
<p>And saviours shall come up on montem Sion to iudicare the montem of Esau; and the regnum shall be Dominus.</p>
