  "Moreover Job continued his parable, and said, Oh that I were as in mensis prior, in the dies when God preserved me;",
  "When his lucerna shined upon my caput, and when by his lumen I walked through tenebrae;",
  "As I was in the dies of my juventus, when the consilium of God was upon my tabernaculum;",
  "When the Omnipotens was yet with me, when my discipuli were round about me:",
  "When I washed my pedes with butyrum, and the petra poured me out rivi:",
  "When my via was enswathed with crepusculum, and the lucerna of the noctis shined upon my caput;",
  "When I went out to porta, and prepared my cathedram in platea;",
  "The juvenis saw me, and hid themselves: and the senes arose, and stood up;",
  "The principes ceased from loquendo, and laid their manus super os:",
  "The vox of the nobilium was not heard, and they made their linguam cleave to the palatum;",
  "The aures which heard me, called me Beatus: and the oculi which saw me gave testimonium:",
  "Because I delivered the pauper who cried, and the pupillus, and him who had non adiutor;",
  "The benedictio of him that was moribundus came upon me: and I made the cor of the vidua to sing;",
  "I put on justitia, and it covered me: my judicium was as a vestis and a diadema;",
  "I was oculi to the caecus, and pedes to the claudus;",
  "I was pater to the pauper: and the causam which I knew not I searched out;",
  "And I brake the morsus of the iniquus, and plucked the praeda out of his dentes;",
  "Then I said, I shall die in my nidus, and I shall multiply my dies as the arena;",
  "My radix was spread out by the aqua, and the ros repente mea nocte:",
  "My gladius was fresh and green, and my scapus sent out branches;",
  "My via was not obscura, but the nubes returned after the pluviarum:",
  "The auris heard me, and blessed me: and when I spoke they gave testimonium;",
  "For I was pacificus, and pacificus was my consilium:",
  "I was sicut the terra without pluviam, and sicut the herbula that fuit sine aqua;",
  "The facies of the pauper did not make me tristis, and I did not hide my manus from the tribulatio of the pupillus;",
  "If my vestis was my iustitia, and I covered my caput with my pallium:",
  "If I saw any moribundus for cold, or any pauper that had non vestis;",
  "If his lumbus blessed me, and if I warmed him with the lanio of my agnus;",
  "If I did eat my panis alone, and the pupillus did not eat thereof:",
  "Or I saw the pauper, and I did not give him, or the vidua and the pupillus, and did not receive a cloak:",
  "If I made gold my spes, or said to the auri, Thou art my fiducia:",
  "If I rejoyced because my substantia was great, and because my manus had gotten much:",
  "If I did behold the lucerna when it shined, and the aurora when it was fair;",
  "If I did make my cor to go after it, or if I did kiss my manus:",
  "This also were peccatum of superbia, and iniquitas ad judicium:",
  "For I have not given credulitas to the vocem of the Omnipotens, and I have not prostratus me before him:",
  "If I have made gold my spes, and the auri my confidencia:",
  "If I rejoyced because my substantia was great, and because my manus had gotten much:",
  "If I did behold the lucerna when it shined, and the aurora when it was fair;",
  "If I did make my cor to go after it, or if I did kiss my manus:",
  "This also were peccatum of superbia, and iniquitas ad judicium:",
  "For I have not given credulitia to the vocem of the Omnipotens, and I have not prostratus me before him:"
