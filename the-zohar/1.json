  "Bereshit bara Elohim caelum et terram. And the earth was without form, and void; and tenebrae were upon the face of the abyssus. And the Spiritus of God moved upon the face of the aquae.",
  "And God said, Fiat lux. And there was lux. And God saw the lux, that it was bonum: and God divided the lux from the tenebrae.",
  "And God called the lux, Diem. And the tenebrae, He called, Nox. And the evening and the morning were, Dies unus.",
  "And God said, Fiat firmamentum in medio aquarum. And let it divide the aquae from the aquae. And God made the firmamentum, and divided the aquae which were under the firmamentum from the aquae which were above the firmamentum: and it was so.",
  "And God called the firmamentum, Caelum. And the evening and the morning were, Dies secundus."
