  "And the Lord spake unto Aaron, saying, Thou and thy filii shall not come at the same tempus into the sanctuarium, lest ye die: for ego will appear in the nubes upon the propitiatorium.",
  "Thou shalt not go out from the ostium of the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: for the unction of the Lord is upon thee. And they did according to the word of Moses.",
  "And the Lord spake unto Aaron, saying, Do not drink vinum nor sicera, thou nor thy filii with thee, when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: shall be a statutum perpetual throughout your generation:",
  "That ye may put difference between sanctum and profanum, and between pollutum and mundum, And that ye may teach the filii of Israel all the statuta which the Lord hath spoken unto them by the manu of Moses.",
  "And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and Ithamar, his filii that were left, Take the oblation of the remnant of the sacrificia of the Lord, made by fieri with fire, and eat it without panis near the altare: for it is sanctum of sanctorum.",
  "And ye shall eat it in loco sancto, because it is thy portio and the portio of thy filii of the sacrificia of the Lord: for so I am commanded.",
  "And the pectus of the elevation, and the armum of the separation shall Aaron the sacerdos and his filii have for their portio from the sacrificia of the Lord, which he shall offer to the Lord, and they shall be sanctum of sanctorum unto thee and unto thy filii with thee by a statutum perpetual throughout thy generation, as the Lord hath commanded.",
  "And the Lord spake unto Aaron, Behold, I also have given thee the custodiam of my oblation of all the sancta of the filii of Israel; I have given them unto thee by reason of the unction, and to thy filii with thee, by a statutum perpetual: it shall be a lex perpetual throughout thy generation, that they shall eat from the sacrificia of the Lord.",
  "This shall be thine of the most sancta, reserved from the sacrificia unto the Lord: every oblation of theirs, and every sacrificium of theirs, and every propitiatorium of theirs, and every propitiatorium of the filii of Israel, which they shall offer unto the Lord, shall be thine and thy filii with thee, by a statutum perpetual: it is a pactum perpetual in the presence of the Lord unto thee and unto thy filii with thee.",
  "And the Lord spake unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no hereditas in their terra, neither shalt thou have any part among them: I am thy part and thine hereditas among the filii of Israel.",
  "And, behold, I have given the filii of Levi all the decimas in Israel for an hereditas, for their servitium which they serve, even the servitium of the tabernacle of the congregation.",
  "Neither must the filii of Israel henceforth come nigh the tabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear peccatum, and die.",
  "But the Levites shall do the servitium of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they shall bear their peccatum: it shall be a statutum perpetual throughout your generation, that among the filii of Israel they have no hereditas.",
  "But the tithes of the filii of Israel, which they offer as an oblation unto the Lord, I have given to the Levites to inherit: therefore I have said unto them, Among the filii of Israel they shall have no hereditas.",
  "And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Thus speakest thou unto the Levites, and sayest unto them, When ye take of the filii of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your hereditas, then ye shall offer up an heave oblation of it for the Lord, even a tenth part of the tithe.",
  "And this your heave oblation shall be reckoned unto you, as though it were the granum of the area, and the plenitudo of the torcular: thus ye shall also offer an heave oblation unto the Lord of all your tithes, which ye receive of the filii of Israel; and ye shall give thereof the Lord's heave oblation to Aaron the sacerdos.",
  "Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave oblation of the Lord, of all the best thereof, even the sanctum of it out of it.",
  "Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye have heaved the best thereof from it, then it shall be counted unto the Levites as the productio of the area, and as the productio of the torcular:",
  "And ye shall eat it in every loco, ye and your domus: for it is your merces for your servitium in the tabernacle of the congregation.",
  "And ye shall bear no peccatum by reason of it, when ye have heaved from it the best of it: neither shall ye pollute the sancta of the filii of Israel, that ye die not.",
  "And the Lord spake unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no hereditas in their terra; the Lord is thy hereditas: but the tribe of Levi shall have no hereditas among them.",
  "The filii of Levi shall do the servitium of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they shall bear their peccatum: and among the filii of Israel they shall have no hereditas, it is a statutum perpetual throughout your generation.",
  "And it shall be unto the filii of Levi for an hereditas, I am their hereditas: and thou shalt give them no hereditas among the filii of Israel, for I am their hereditas.",
  "And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Thus speakest thou unto the Levites, and sayest unto them, When the filii of Israel come into the terra which I give unto them, then shall the Levites go in to serve me in the tabernacle of the congregation.",
  "And the Levites shall do the servitium of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they shall bear their peccatum, and it shall be a statutum perpetual throughout your generation, that among the filii of Israel the Levites have no hereditas.",
  "But the Levites shall do the servitium of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they shall bear their peccatum: and among the filii of Israel they shall have no hereditas; I am their hereditas: I am the Lord."
