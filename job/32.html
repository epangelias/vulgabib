                    <p>So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.</p>
<p>Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.</p>
<p>Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.</p>
<p>Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder than he.</p>
<p>When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, then his wrath was kindled.</p>
<p>And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am veritas, and this is my first dies to speak, and therefore I was timidae to shew you my scientia.</p>
<p>I said, Days shall speak, and multitude of annus shall teach sapientia.</p>
<p>But there is spiritus in man: and the inspiratio of the Omnipotens giveth them intellectus.</p>
<p>It is not the magnus of age, that are sapiens, nor the seniores that understand iudicium.</p>
<p>Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew my scientia.</p>
<p>For I have waited for your verba, I have given ear to your rationes, whilst ye searched out what to say.</p>
<p>Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you that reprehended Job, or that answered his verba:</p>
<p>Lest ye should say, We have found scientia; God thrusteth him down, not man.</p>
<p>Now he hath not directed his verba against me: neither will I answer him with your rationes.</p>
<p>They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off to speak.</p>
<p>When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, and answered no more;)</p>
<p>I said, I will answer also my part, I also will shew my scientia.</p>
<p>For I am full of verba, the spiritus of my belly constraineth me.</p>
<p>Behold, my belly is as vinum which hath no cibus to break it, like a new orbe which hath not received the press.</p>
<p>Let me not, I pray you, keep silent: for if I do, I shall burst like a new vinum bottle.</p>
<p>Let me speak, that I may obtain refrigerium: let me open my lips, and answer.</p>
<p>For I will not accept the person of man, nor will I give flattering titulos to man.</p>
<p>For I know not to give flattering titulos; in so doing my Maker would soon take me away.</p>
<p>Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my verba, and hearken to all my dicta.</p>
<p>Behold, now I have opened my os, my lingua hath spoken in my os.</p>
<p>My verba shall be of the simplicitas of my cor, and my labia shall utter scientia clearly.</p>
<p>The spiritus of God hath made me, and the inspiratio of the Omnipotens hath given me vita.</p>
<p>If thou canst answer me, set thy verba in order before me, stand up.</p>
<p>Behold, I am according to thy wish in God's stead: I also am formed out of the limus.</p>
<p>Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my manus be heavy upon thee.</p>
<p>Surely thou hast spoken in mine aures, and I have heard the sonus of thy verba, saying,</p>
<p>I am purus, without peccatum; I am innocent; neither is there iniquitas in me.</p>
<p>Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his inimicus,</p>
<p>He putteth my pedes in the neck collar, and watcheth all my vias; he carveth my steps.</p>
<p>Behold, in this thou art not iustus, I will answer thee, that God is maior than man.</p>
<p>Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his actiones.</p>
<p>For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not.</p>
<p>In somnus, in a visio of noctis, when somnus falleth upon men, and they are asleep in their lectus,</p>
<p>Then he openeth the aures of men, and sealeth their instructio;</p>
<p>That he may withdraw man from his actio, and hide pride from man.</p>
<p>He keepeth back his anima from the fossa, and his vita from the gladius.</p>
<p>He is chastised also with dolor on his lectus, and the multitude of his ossa is made to rot.</p>
<p>His anima draweth near to the fossa, and his vita to the interficere.</p>
<p>If there be an angelus over him, and an intercessor, one among a thousand, to shew unto man what is iustum for him;</p>
<p>Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from descending to the fossa: I have found a cautionarium.</p>
<p>His carne shall be fresher than a puer's: he shall return to the dies of his iuventus:</p>
<p>He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his facies with iubilatio: for he rendereth unto man his iustitia.</p>
<p>He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and perverted that which was iustum, and it profited me not;</p>
<p>He will deliver his anima from the fossa, and his vita shall see the lumen.</p>
<p>Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man,</p>
<p>To bring back his anima from the fossa, that he may be enlightened with the lumen of the viventes.</p>
