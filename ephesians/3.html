                    <p>For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles, If ye have heard of the dispensatio of the gratia of God which is given me to you-ward:</p>
<p>How that by revelation he made known unto me the mysterium; as I wrote afore in few words, Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mysterium of Christ)</p>
<p>Which in other ages was not made known unto the filii of men, as it is now revealed unto his sancti apostoli and prophetae by the Spirit;</p>
<p>That the Gentiles should be fellow-heires, and of the same corpus, and partakers of his promissio in Christ by the evangelium:</p>
<p>Whereof I was made a minister, according to the donum of the gratia of God given unto me by the effectual working of his potentia.</p>
<p>Unto me, who am the minimus of all sancti, is this gratia given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable divitiae of Christ;</p>
<p>And to make all men see what is the dispensatio of the mysterium which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ:</p>
<p>To the intent that now unto the principes and potestates in the caelestia might be known by the ecclesia the manifold sapientia of God,</p>
<p>According to the propositum of the ages, which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:</p>
<p>In whom we have fiducia and access by fides into this gratia wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the gloria of God.</p>
<p>Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulationes for you, which is your gloria.</p>
<p>For this cause I bow my knees unto the Pater of our Lord Jesus Christ,</p>
<p>Of whom the whole familia in caelo and in terra is named,</p>
<p>That he would grant you, according to the divitiae of his gloria, to be strengthened with potentia by his Spirit in the inner homo;</p>
<p>That Christ may dwell in your cordibus by fides; that ye, being rooted and grounded in caritas,</p>
<p>May be able to comprehend with all sancti what is the latitudo, and longitudo, and altitudo, and profundum;</p>
<p>To know the caritas of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the plenitudo of God.</p>
<p>Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the potentia that worketh in us,</p>
<p>Unto him be gloria in the ecclesia by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen.</p>
