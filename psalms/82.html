                    <p>God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judicat among the gods. How long will ye judicare unjustly, and accept the personas of the wicked?</p>
<p>Defendite the poor and fatherless: do justitia to the afflicted and needy.</p>
<p>Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the manus of the wicked.</p>
<p>They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in tenebrae: all the foundations of the terra are moved.</p>
<p>I have said, Ye are dii; and all of you are filii of the Most High.</p>
<p>But ye shall die like mortales, and fall like unus of the principes.</p>
<p>Arise, O Deus, judicate the terra: for thou shalt haereditas among all nations.</p>
