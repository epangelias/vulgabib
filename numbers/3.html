                    <p>These also are the generations of Aaron and Moses in the dies of the congregation's going out of Aegypt.</p>
<p>Take the sum of the sons of Kohath from among the sons of Levi, after their families, by the domus of their patres;</p>
<p>From triginta years old and upward even until quinquaginta year old, all that enter into the officium to do the opus in the tabernaculum of the congregation:</p>
<p>This shall be the officium of the sons of Kohath in the tabernaculum of the congregation, about the sanctum sanctorum.</p>
<p>When the castra is to be moved, Aaron shall come, and his filii, and they shall take down the velum, and cover the arca of the testimonium with it:</p>
<p>And shall put thereon the covering of badger's skin, and shall spread over it a cloth wholly of hyacinth, and shall put in the staves thereof.</p>
<p>And upon the table of proposition they shall spread a cloth of hyacinth, and put thereon the scyphi, and the candelabra, and the mortaria, and the calices, and the oblation of the libelli, which they shall pour out;</p>
<p>And they shall put upon it all the vascula thereof, wherewith they minister about it: and they shall cover it, and all the vascula thereof, with a covering of badger's skins, and put it upon the vectis.</p>
<p>And upon the golden altar they shall spread a cloth of hyacinth, and cover it with a covering of badger's skins, and put to it the staves:</p>
<p>And they shall take all the instruments of the ministerium, wherewith they minister in the sanctum, and put them in a cloth of hyacinth, and cover them with a covering of badger's skins, and put them on the vectis:</p>
<p>And they shall take away the ashes from the altar, and spread a purple cloth thereon:</p>
<p>And they shall put upon it all the vascula thereof, wherewith they minister about it, even candelabra, the mortaria, the candelabra, and the calices, and all the vascula of the oleum, wherewith they minister about it:</p>
<p>And they shall cover it, and all the vascula thereof, with a covering of badger's skins, and put it upon the vectis.</p>
<p>And when Aaron and his filii have made an end of covering the sanctum, and all the vascula of the sanctum, as the castra is to set forward; after that, the sons of Kohath shall come to bear it: but they shall not touch any sanctum, lest they die. These things are the burden of the sons of Kohath in the tabernaculum of the congregation.</p>
<p>And to the office of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the pontifex, pertaineth the oleum for the lumina, and the incense aromatica, and the daily oblation, and the oleum of unction, and the oversight of all the tabernaculum, and of all that therein is, in the sanctum, and in the vascula thereof.</p>
<p>And the pontifex shall give her a pot of aqua sancta in an earthen vessel.</p>
<p>And the pontifex shall take a candelabrum, and put it in his dexteram manus, and the testimony of the covenant in his sinistram manus, and the candelabrum in his dexteram manus.</p>
<p>And Aaron and his filii shall go into the tabernaculum of the congregation, and the pontifex shall put incense aromatica in the censer, and cover the arca of the testimonium with the incense aromatica, that the pontifex die not:</p>
<p>And he shall take of the blood of the vitulus, and put it upon the cornua of the altar with his finger, and pour all the blood beside the base of the altar.</p>
<p>And the pontifex shall take of the blood of the vitulus, and put it upon the cornua of the altar of the holocaust, and pour all the blood beside the base of the altar, and burn all the fat for a sweet odorem unto the Lord.</p>
<p>And the pontifex shall take of the ram, and burn the pellis, and the carnes, and the intestina, and the pedes, and the fimum, and the sanguinem, and the caput, and the ungues, and the pilus, and the cuticula, and the intestina, and the pedes, and the fimum, and the sanguinem, and the caput, and the ungues, and the pilus, and the cuticula.</p>
<p>And the pontifex shall wash his manus and pedes in aqua sancta, and put on his vestes, and take the censer, and put incense aromatica therein, and burn it upon the altar, and make an atonement for the pontifex, and for his domus.</p>
<p>And the pontifex shall take of the blood of the ram, and put it upon the tip of the dexteram aurem of Aaron, and upon the tip of the dexteram aurem of his filii, and upon the pollicem of their dexteram manus, and upon the pollicem of their pedis dexteri.</p>
<p>And the pontifex shall sprinkle of the blood upon the altar, and burn the fat for a sweet odorem unto the Lord.</p>
<p>And the pontifex shall take of the ram, and burn the pellis, and the carnes, and the intestina, and the pedes, and the fimum, and the sanguinem, and the caput, and the ungues, and the pilus, and the cuticula, and the intestina, and the pedes, and the fimum, and the sanguinem, and the caput, and the ungues, and the pilus, and the cuticula.</p>
<p>This is the law of the holocaust, and of the sacrifice, and of the pro peccato, and of the pro delicto, and of the consecratio, and of the hostia pacificorum;</p>
<p>Which the Lord commanded Moses in the dies of the congregation's going out of Aegypt.</p>
