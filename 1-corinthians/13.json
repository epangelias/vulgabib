  "Though I speak with the lingua of homines and of angelos, and have not caritas, I am become as sounding aes, or a tinkling cymbalum.",
  "And though I have prophetiam, and understand omnes mysteria, and omne scientiam; and though I have fidem, so that I could remove montes, and have not caritas, I am nihil.",
  "And though I bestow on the pauperes all my facultas, and though I tradam my corpus, ut ardeam, and have not caritas, it profiteth me nihil.",
  "Caritas suffereth long, and is benigna; caritas enviieth not; caritas vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,",
  "Doth not behave itself invidiose, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no malum;",
  "Rejoiceth not in iniquitate, but rejoiceth in veritate;",
  "Beareth omnes, believeth omnes, hopeth omnes, endureth omnes.",
  "Caritas never faileth; but whether there be prophetiae, they shall fail; whether there be linguae, they shall cessare; whether there be scientia, it shall destroy itself;",
  "For we know in parte, and we prophesy in parte.",
  "But when that which is perfectum is come, then that which is in parte shall be done away.",
  "When I was puer, I spake as puer, I understood as puer, I thought as puer; but when I became vir, I put away puerilia.",
  "For now we see per speculum in aenigmate; but then face to face; now I know in parte; but then shall I know, even as I am known.",
  "And now abideth fides, spes, caritas, these three; but the greatest of these is caritas."
