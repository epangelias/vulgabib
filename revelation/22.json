  "And I saw an angelus standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud vox, saying to all the aves that fly in the midst of heaven, Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the magnus Deus;",
  "That ye may eat the flesh of reges, and the flesh of tribuni, and the flesh of potentiores, and the flesh of equi, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both liberi and servi, and of both magni and parvi.",
  "And I saw the beast, and the rex of the earth, and their exercitus, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his exercitus.",
  "And the beast was taken, and with him the falsus propheta that wrought miracula before him, with which he deceived them that had received the character of the beast, and them that worshipped his imago.",
  "These both were cast alive into a lacus of ignis burning with sulphur.",
  "And the rex of the earth and the armies of them were slain by the gladius of him that sat upon the horse, who is called the Verbum of Deus.",
  "And all the aves were filled with their carnibus.",
  "And I saw a novus caelum and a novus terra: for the first caelum and the first terra were passed away; and there was no more mare.",
  "And I, John, saw the holy civitas, the New Jerusalem, coming down from Deus out of caelum, prepared as a sponsa adorned for her maritus.",
  "And I heard a vox from the throne, saying, Behold, the tabernaculum of Deus is with homines, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his populus, and Deus himself shall be with them, and be their Deus.",
  "And God shall wipe away all lacrimae from their oculi; and there shall be no more mors, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more dolor: for the former things are passed away.",
  "And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things nova. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are fidelis and verus.",
  "And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the principio and the finis. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fons of the aqua of vita freely.",
  "He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his Deus, and he shall be my filius.",
  "But the timidi, and increduli, and abomi, and homicidae, and fornicatores, and venefici, and idolis, and omnes qui loverunt et fecerunt mendacium, shall have their part in the lacus burning with sulphur, which is the secunda mors.",
  "And one of the septem angeli, which had the septem vasa plena of the septem novissimis plagis, came and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the sponsa, the uxorem of the Agnus.",
  "And he carried me away in the spirit to a grande and high montem, and shewed me that grande and holy civitas, the New Jerusalem, descending out of caelum from Deus;",
  "Having the glory of Deus: and her lumen was like unto a stone most precious, even jaspis, as clear as crystallus;",
  "And had a wall great and high, and had duodecim portae, and at the gates duodecim angeli, and names written thereon, which are the names of the duodecim tribus of the filii of Israel;",
  "On the est side three portae; on the septentrional side three portae; on the meridian side three portae; and on the occidentalis side three portae.",
  "And the wall of the civitas had duodecim fundamenta, and in them the names of the duodecim apostoli of the Agnus.",
  "And he that talked with me had a golden mensura, that he might measure the civitas, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof.",
  "And the civitas lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he measured the civitas with the golden mensura, twelve thousand furlongs: the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.",
  "And I saw no templum therein: for the Domini Deus omnipotens and the Agnus are the templum of it.",
  "And the civitas had no need of the sol, neither of the luna, to shine in it: for the claritas of Deus did lighten it, and the Agnus is the lamp thereof.",
  "And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the lumine of it: and the rex of the earth shall bring their gloria and honor into it.",
  "And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall be no night there.",
  "And they shall bring the gloria and honor of the nations into it.",
  "And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a mendacium: but they which are written in the liber of life of the Agnus."
