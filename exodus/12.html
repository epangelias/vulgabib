                    <p>And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in terra of Egypt, saying,</p>
<p>This mensis shall be unto you the beginning of mensis: it shall be the first mensis of the year to you.</p>
<p>Speak ye unto the whole congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth dies of this mensis they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to the domus of their patres, a lamb for a domus:</p>
<p>And if the familia be too little for the lamb, let him and his proximus take it according to the numerus of animae; every man according to his facultas shall make reckoning for the lamb.</p>
<p>Your lamb shall be without macula, a masculus of one year: ye shall take it out from the aries, or from the capra.</p>
<p>And ye shall keep it up until the quartus decimus dies of the same mensis: and the whole congregation of the congregation of Israel shall slay it in the vesper.</p>
<p>And they shall take of the sanguis, and strike it on the two postes and on the superliminar of the domus, wherein they shall eat it.</p>
<p>And they shall eat the carnem in nocte, assus with ignis, and panis azymus; with amarior herbs they shall eat it.</p>
<p>Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with aqua, but roasted with ignis; his caput with his pedes, and his intestina.</p>
<p>And ye shall let none of it remain until mane; and that which remaineth of it until mane ye shall burn with ignis.</p>
<p>And thus shall ye eat it; with your lumbi girded, your caligae on your pedes, and your baculi in your manus; and ye shall eat it in festinatio: it is the pascha of the LORD.</p>
<p>For I will pass through terra of Egypt this nocte, and will smite all the primogeniti in terra of Egypt, both man and anima, and against all the dei of Egypt I will execute iudicium: I am the LORD.</p>
<p>And the sanguis shall be to you for a signe upon the domus, wherein ye are: and when I see the sanguis, I will pass over you, and the flagellum shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite terra of Egypt.</p>
<p>And this dies shall be unto you for a memoria, and ye shall keep it a festum to the LORD throughout your generation; ye shall keep it a custodia perpetua.</p>
<p>Septem dies shall ye eat panis azymus; even the first die ye shall put away fermentum out of your domus: for whosoever eateth fermentum from the first die until the septimus die, that anima shall be cut off from Israel.</p>
<p>And in the first die there shall be a sanctificatio, and in the septimus die there shall be a sanctificatio to you.</p>
<p>No work shall be done in them, save that which every anima must eat, that only may be done of you.</p>
<p>And ye shall observe the festum of panis azymus; for in this very same die I brought your exercitus out of terra of Egypt: therefore shall ye observe this die in your generation by a custodia perpetua.</p>
<p>In the first mensis, on the quartus decimus die of the mensis at vesper, ye shall eat panis azymus, until the una et vigesima die of the mensis at vesper.</p>
<p>Septem dies shall there be no fermentum found in your domus: for whosoever eateth that which is fermentum, even that anima shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a peregrinator, or born in the terra.</p>
<p>Ye shall eat nothing fermentum; in all your habitationes shall ye eat panis azymus.</p>
<p>Then Moses called for all the senatores of Israel, and said unto them, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your familiae, and kill the pascha.</p>
<p>And ye shall take a fasciculus of hyssop, and dip it in the sanguis that is in the bacinella, and strike the sanguis that is in the bacinella upon the superliminar and upon the two postes; and none of you shall go out at the ostium of his domus until mane.</p>
<p>For the LORD will pass through to smite the Aegyptii; and when he seeth the sanguis upon the superliminar, and on the two postes, the LORD will pass over the ostium, and will not suffer the percutiens to come in unto your domus to smite you.</p>
<p>And ye shall observe this thing for a custodia to thee and to thy filii for ever:</p>
<p>And it shall be when ye come to the terra which the LORD will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep this servitium.</p>
<p>And it shall be when your filii shall say unto you, What mean ye by this servitium?</p>
<p>That ye shall say, It is the servitium of the pascha of the LORD, who passed over the domus of the filii of Israel in terra of Egypt, when he smote the Aegyptii, and delivered our domus. And the populus bowed the caput and worshipped.</p>
<p>And the filii of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.</p>
<p>And it came to pass, that at media nocte the LORD smote all the primogeniti in terra of Egypt, from the primogenitus of Pharaonis who sat on his thronus unto the primogenitus of the captivus who was in the carcer, and all the primogeniti of the anima.</p>
<p>And Pharaonis arose in nocte, he, and all his servientes, and all the Aegyptii; and there was a great clamor in terra of Egypt; for there was not a domus where there was not a mortuus.</p>
<p>And he called for Moses and Aaron nocte, and said, Rise up, and get you forth from among my populus, both ye and the filii of Israel; and go, serve the LORD, as ye have said.</p>
<p>Also take your greges and your armenta, as ye have said, and be gone; and bless me also.</p>
<p>And the Aegyptii were urgent upon the populus, that they might send them out of the terra in festinatio; for they said, We be all mortui men.</p>
<p>And the populus took their placentas before it was fermentum, their conspersa being bound up in their vestes upon their umeri.</p>
<p>And the filii of Israel did according to the verbum of Moses; and they asked of the Aegyptii vessels of argentum, and vessels of aurum, and vestes:</p>
<p>And the LORD gave the populum favour in the oculi of the Aegyptii, so that they lent unto them such things as they required. And they spoiled the Aegyptii.</p>
<p>And the filii of Israel iourneyed from Rameses to Succoth, about sexcenta milia of pedes, all that were masculi.</p>
<p>And a mixta multitude went up also with them; and oviculae, and armenta, very much pecus.</p>
<p>And they baked panis azymus of the farina which they brought forth out of Aegyptus, for it was not fermentum; because they were thrust out of Aegyptus, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared any cibus for themselves.</p>
<p>Now the tempus that the filii of Israel dwelt in Aegypto was four hundred triginta annis.</p>
<p>And it came to pass at the end of four hundred triginta annis, even the very same die it came to pass, that all the exercitus of the LORD went out from terra of Egypt.</p>
<p>It is a nocte to be much observed unto the LORD for bringing them out from terra of Egypt: this is that nocte of the LORD to be observed of all the filii of Israel in their generation.</p>
<p>And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ritus of the pascha: No alienigena shall eat thereof:</p>
<p>But every man's servus who is bought for argentum, when thou hast circumcisus him, then shall he eat thereof.</p>
<p>A peregrinator and a mercennarius shall not eat thereof.</p>
<p>In una domus shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth of the carnem out of the domus; neither shalt thou break a os thereof.</p>
<p>All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.</p>
<p>And when a peregrinator shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the pascha of the LORD, let all his masculi be circumcisi; then shall he come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is natus in the terra: for no incircumcisus person shall eat thereof.</p>
<p>One lex shall be to him that is natus at home, and unto the peregrinator that sojourneth among you.</p>
<p>Thus did all the filii of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.</p>
<p>And it came to pass the very same die, that the LORD did bring the filii of Israel out of terra of Egypt by their exercitus.</p>
