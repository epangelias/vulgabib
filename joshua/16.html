                    <p>And the lot of the children of Ioseph fell from Iordan by Iericho, unto the water of Iericho eastward, to the wildernesse that goeth vp from Iericho through mount Bethel,</p>
<p>And goeth out from Bethel to Luz, and passeth along vnto the borders of Archi to Ataroth,</p>
<p>And goeth downe westward to the coast of Iaphleti, vnto the coast of Bethhoron the nether, and to Gezer: and the goings out thereof are at the Sea,</p>
<p>So the children of Ioseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, tooke their inheritance,</p>
<p>And the border of the children of Ephraim according to their families, was thus: euen the border of their inheritance on the East side was Ataroth-Addar, vnto Bethhoron the vpper;</p>
<p>And the border went out toward the Sea, to Michmethah on the North side, and the border went about Eastward vnto Taanath-Shiloh, and passed by it on the East to Ianoah;</p>
<p>And it went downe from Ianoah to Ataroth, and to Naarath, and came to Iericho, and went out at Iordan;</p>
<p>The border went out from Tappuah westward vnto the riuer Kanah, and the goings out thereof were in the Sea: this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim by their families;</p>
<p>And the separate cities for the children of Ephraim were among the inheritance of the children of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages;</p>
<p>And they draue not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer: but the Canaanites dwelt among the Ephraimites vnto this day, and serued vnder tribute.</p>
<p>And the lot of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was for Machir the first borne of Manasseh, the father of Gilead: because he was a man of warre, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan.</p>
<p>There was also a lot for the rest of the children of Manasseh by their families; for the children of Abiezer, and for the children of Helek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the children of Shechem, and for the children of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida: these were the male children of Manasseh the sonne of Ioseph by their families.</p>
<p>But Zelophehad the sonne of Hepher, the sonne of Gilead, the sonne of Machir, the sonne of Manasseh, had no sonnes, but daughters: and these are the names of his daughters, Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.</p>
<p>These came neere before Eleazar the Priest, and before Ioshua the sonne of Nun, and before the princes, saying, The Lord commanded Moses to giue vs an inheritance among our brethren: therefore according to the commandement of the Lord he gaue them an inheritance among the brethren of their father.</p>
<p>And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, beside the land of Gilead and Bashan, which were on the other side Iordan;</p>
<p>Because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sonnes: and the rest of Manasseh's sonnes had the land of Gilead.</p>
<p>And the coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah, that lieth before Shechem, and the border went along on the right hand vnto the inhabitants of Entappuah.</p>
<p>Now Manasseh had the land of Tappuah: but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim;</p>
<p>And the border descended vnto the riuer Kanah, Southward of the riuer: these cities of Ephraim are among the cities of Manasseh: the border of Manasseh also was on the North side of the riuer, and the outgoings of it were at the Sea:</p>
<p>Southward it was Ephraims, and Northward it was Manasseh's, and the Sea is his border, and they met together in Asher on the North, and in Issachar on the East.</p>
<p>And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher, Bethshean and her townes, and Ibleam and her townes, and the inhabitants of Dor and her townes, and the inhabitants of Endor and her townes, and the inhabitants of Taanach and her townes, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and her townes, euen three countries.</p>
<p>Yet the children of Manasseh could not driue out the inhabitants of those cities, but the Canaanites would dwel in that land.</p>
<p>Yet it came to passe when the children of Israel were waxen strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, but did not vtterly driue them out.</p>
<p>And the children of Ioseph spake vnto Ioshua, saying, Why hast thou giuen me but one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing I am a great people, forasmuch as the Lord hath blessed me hitherto?</p>
<p>And Ioshua answered them, If thou be a great people, then get thee vp to the wood countrey, and cut downe for thy selfe there in the land of the Perizzites and of the giants, if mount Ephraim be too narrow for thee.</p>
<p>And the children of Ioseph said, The hill is not enough for vs: and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley, haue charets of iron, both they who are of Bethshean and her townes, and they who are of the valley of Iezreel.</p>
<p>And Ioshua spake vnto the house of Ioseph, euen to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, Thou art a great people, and hast great power: thou shalt not haue one lot onely;</p>
<p>But the mountaine shall be thine, for it is a wood, and thou shalt cut it downe: and the outgoings of it shall be thine: for thou shalt driue out the Canaanites, though they haue iron charets, and though they be strong.</p>
