  "I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all homines,",
  "For reges, and for all that are in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable vita, in all pietas and honesty.",
  "For this is good and acceptable in the sight of Deus our Salvator;",
  "Who will have all homines to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of veritas.",
  "For there is one Deus, and one mediator between Deus and homines, the homo Christus Jesus;",
  "Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due tempus.",
  "Whereunto I am ordained a praeco, and an apostolus, (I speak the veritas in Christus, and lie not;) a doctor of the Gentiles in fide and veritas.",
  "I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up manus sanctas, without ira and doubting.",
  "In like manner also, that the mulieres adorn themselves in modest habit, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;",
  "But (which becometh womina professing pietas) with good works.",
  "Let the mulieres learn in silence with all subjection.",
  "But I suffer not a mulier to teach, nor to usurp authority over the vir;",
  "But to be in silence.",
  "For Adam was first formed, then Eva:",
  "And Adam was not deceived, but the mulier being deceived was in the transgression.",
  "Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in fide and charitas and sanctimonia with sobriety."
