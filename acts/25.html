                    <p>And when Festus was set down on the iudicem, Paulus said, Appello ad Caesarem.</p>
<p>Then Festus, when he had conferred with the concilium, answered, Thou hast appealed unto Caesar, unto Caesar thou shalt go.</p>
<p>And after certain dies, when Agrippa the king and Bernice were come unto Caesarea to salute Festus,</p>
<p>Festus laid Paulus' causa before the king, saying, There is a certain homo left in custodia by Felix:</p>
<p>About whom, when I was at Hierosolyma, the principes of the sacerdotes and the seniores of the Iudaei informed me, desiring to have iudicium against him.</p>
<p>To whom I answered, It is not the consuetudo of the Romanis to deliver any homo to die, before that he which is accused have the accusatores face to face, and have licence to defend himself concerning the crimen laid against him:</p>
<p>When they were come hither, without any mora on the following dies I sedit in the iudicem, and commanded the homo to be brought forth:</p>
<p>Against whom when the accusatores stood up, they brought none accusation of such things as I supposed:</p>
<p>But had certain quaestiones against him of their own superstition, and of one Iesus, which was dead, whom Paulus affirmed to be vivus.</p>
<p>And because I doubted of such manner of quaestiones, I asked him whether he would go to Hierosolyma, and there be iudged of these matters.</p>
<p>But when Paulus had appealed to be reserved unto the iudicium of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar.</p>
<p>Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the homo myself. To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.</p>
<p>And on the following dies, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pompa, and was entered into the auditorium with the tribuni and principes of the civitas, at Festus' commandement Paulus was brought forth.</p>
<p>And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here present with us, ye see this homo, about whom all the multitudo of the Iudaei have dealt with me, both at Hierosolyma, and here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.</p>
<p>But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of morte, and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him.</p>
<p>Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my dominus. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, O king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write.</p>
<p>For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not withal to signify the crimina laid against him.</p>
<p>Then Agrippa said unto Paulus, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paulus stretched forth the manum, and answered for himself:</p>
<p>I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Iudaei:</p>
<p>Especially because I know thee to be expert in all custumes and quaestiones which are among the Iudaei: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.</p>
<p>My manner of vita from my iuventus, which was at the first among mine own gentem at Hierosolyma, know all the Iudaei;</p>
<p>Who knew me from the principio, if they would testify, that after the most stricte sect of our religio I lived a Pharisaismus.</p>
<p>And now I stand and am iudged for the spes of the promissio made of Deus unto our patres:</p>
<p>Unto which promissio our duodecim tribus, instantly serving Deus day and nocte, hope to come. For which hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Iudaei.</p>
<p>Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that Deus should raise the mortui?</p>
<p>I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many contraria to the nomine of Iesus of Nazareth.</p>
<p>Which thing I also did in Hierosolyma: and many of the sancti did I shut up in custodia, having received autoritas from the principes of the sacerdotes; and when they were put to morte, I gave my sententia.</p>
<p>And I punished them oft in every synagoga, and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto the externae civitates.</p>
<p>At which time I was going to Damascum with autoritas and potentia from the principes of the sacerdotes,</p>
<p>At mid dies, O king, I saw in the via a lumen from caelum, above the splendorem of the sol, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me.</p>
<p>When we were all fallen to the terra, I heard a vox speaking unto me, and saying in the lingua Hebraea, Saulus, Saulus, quare me persequeris? it is hard for thee to kick against the stimulum.</p>
<p>And I said, Who art thou, Domine? And he said, I am Iesus whom thou persequeris.</p>
<p>But rise, and stand upon thy pedes: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee minister and testem of those things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee;</p>
<p>Delivering thee from the populus, and from the gentes, unto whom now I send thee,</p>
<p>To open their oculi, and to turn them from tenebris to lumen, and from the potestas of Satanas unto Deus, that they may receive remissio of peccata, and inheritance among them which are sanctificati by fide which is in me.</p>
<p>Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the caelestis vision:</p>
<p>But shewed first unto them of Damascum, and at Hierosolyma, and throughout all the region of Iudaea, and then to the gentes, that they should repent and turn to Deus, doing opera digna of penitentia.</p>
<p>For this cause the Iudaei caught me in the templum, and went about to kill me.</p>
<p>Having therefore obtained help of Deus, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to the parvus and to the magnus, saying none other things than those which the propheti and Moyses did say should come:</p>
<p>That Christus should suffer, and that he should be the first of the resurrection of the mortui, and should shew lumen to the populus, and to the gentes.</p>
<p>And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud vox, Paulus, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad.</p>
<p>But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of veritas and sobrietas.</p>
<p>For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner.</p>
<p>King Agrippa, believest thou the propheti? I know that thou believest.</p>
<p>Then Agrippa said unto Paulus, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christianus.</p>
<p>And Paulus said, I would to Deus, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these vincula.</p>
<p>And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them:</p>
<p>And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This homo doth nothing worthy of morte or vincula.</p>
<p>Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This homo might have been released, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.</p>
