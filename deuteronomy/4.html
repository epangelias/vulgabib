                    <p>Hear, O Israel: The Lord our Deus is one Lord: Ye shall love the Lord thy Deus with all thine heart, and with all thy animus, and with all thy potentia.</p>
<p>Ye shall not make thee any sculptura, or imago of any thing that is in caelum above, or that is in terra beneath, or that is in aqua beneath the terra.</p>
<p>Thou shalt not adore them, nor servire them: I am the Lord thy Deus, a Deus zelotes, visiting the iniquitas of patres upon filii unto the third and fourth generatio of them that hate me.</p>
<p>Thou shalt not take the nomen of the Lord thy Deus in vanum: for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his nomen in vanum.</p>
<p>Remember the dies Sabbati, to keep it sanctum.</p>
<p>Six dies thou shalt labor, and do all thy opus: But the seventh dies is the Sabbatum of the Lord thy Deus: in it thou shalt not do any opus, thou, nor thy filius, nor thy filia, nor thy servus, nor thy ancilla, nor thine asinus, nor thy peregrinus that is within thy portae.</p>
<p>That thy servus and thy ancilla may rest as well as thou.</p>
<p>And thou shalt remember that thou wast a servus in terra Aegypti, and that the Lord thy Deus brought thee out thence through a manum fortis and a brachium extentum: therefore the Lord thy Deus commanded thee to keep the dies Sabbati.</p>
<p>Honora patrem tuum and matrem tuam, as the Lord thy Deus hath commanded thee; that thy dies may be prolonged, and that it may go well with thee, in the terra which the Lord thy Deus giveth thee.</p>
<p>Non occides.</p>
<p>Non moechaberis.</p>
<p>Non furtum facies.</p>
<p>Non loqueris contra proximum tuum falsum testimonium.</p>
<p>Non concupisces uxorem proximi tui, non domum, non agrum, non servum, non ancillam, non bovem, non asinum, et omnia quae sunt proximi tui.</p>
