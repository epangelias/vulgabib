                    <p>And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this mundus are become the kingdoms of our Dominus, and of his Christ; and he shall reign in aeternum.</p>
<p>And the twenty-four senatores, which sat before Deus, fell upon their facies, and worshipped Deus, saying, We give thee gratias, O Deus, Omnipotens, which art, and wast, and art to venire;</p>
<p>And the altar cried with a loud vox, saying, Even so, O Deus, Deus, Deus, Pater omnipotens, just and true are thy iudicia;</p>
<p>And the four animalia and four and twenty senatores fell down and worshipped Deus that sitteth on the throne, saying, Amen; Alleluia;</p>
<p>And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our Deus, all ye his servi, and ye that fear him, both small and great;</p>
<p>And I saw another angel fly in the midst of the heaven, having the evangelium aeternum to preach unto them that dwell on the terra, and to every natio, and tribu, and lingua, and people;</p>
<p>Saying with a loud vox, Fear Deus, and give glory to him; for the hora of his iudicium is come: and worship him that made the coelum, and the terra, and the sea, and the fountains of aqua;</p>
<p>And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great civitas, because she made all natioes drink of the vinum of the wrath of her fornicatio;</p>
<p>And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud vox, If any man worshippeth the bestia and his imago, and receiveth his character in his frontem, or in his manus;</p>
<p>The same shall drink of the vinum of the wrath of Deus, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignatio; and he shall be tormented with ignis and sulphur in the praesentia of the holy angeli, and in the praesentia of the Agnus;</p>
<p>And the fumus of their torment ascendeth up in saecula saeculorum: and they have no rest diem neque noctem, who worshipped the bestia and his imago, and whosoever receiveth the character of his nomine;</p>
<p>Here is the patience of the sancti, here are they that keep the commandmenta of Deus, and the fide of Iesu.</p>
