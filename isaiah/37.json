  "At that time Merodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah: for he had heard that he had been sick, and was recovered.",
  "And Hezekiah was glad of them, and shewed them the house of his precious things, the silver and the gold and the spices and the precious ointment and all the house of his armour and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah shewed them not.",
  "Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah and said unto him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? And Hezekiah said, They came from a far terra, from Babylon.",
  "And he said, What have they seen in thy domus? And Hezekiah said, All the things that are in mine domus have they seen: there is nothing among my thesauri that I have not shewed them.",
  "Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the Lord of hosts: Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine domus, and that which thy patres have laid up in store until this day, shall be carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the Lord.",
  "And of thy filii, that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palatium of the king of Babylon.",
  "Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, Good is the word of the Lord which thou hast spoken. And he said, For there shall be pacem and securitas in my dies.",
  "And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his potentia, and how he made the piscina, and the aquaeductus, and brought aqua into the civitas, are they not written in the libro annalium of the kings of Judah?",
  "And Hezekiah slept with his patres, and they buried him in the ascent of the sepulchra of the filii of David: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honorem: and Manasseh his filius reigned in his stead."
