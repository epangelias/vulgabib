  "And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river Nilus, also known as Flumen Nili.",
  "And, lo, there came up out of the flumen, seven kine, well favoured and fatfleshed; and they fed in a pratum by the riverside.",
  "And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the flumen, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other kine upon the ripa of the flumen.",
  "And the kine that were ill favoured and leanfleshed did devour the seven kine that were well favoured and fat; and Pharaoh awoke.",
  "And he slept and dreamed the secundum somnium: and, behold, seven spicae grew up in uno culmo, rank and good.",
  "And, behold, seven thin spicae and blasted with the ventus orientalis grew up after them.",
  "And the seven thin spicae devoured the seven rank and full spicae: and Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a somnium.",
  "And it came to pass in the matutine, that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magi of Aegyptus, and all the sapientes thereof, and Pharaoh told them his somnium; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.",
  "Then spake the prince of the cubicularii unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember this day my peccata:",
  "Pharaoh was wroth with his servos, and put me in prison in the domus of the prince of the satrapae, both me and the prince of the pincernae:",
  "And we dreamed a somnium in una nocte, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretatio of his somnium.",
  "And there was there with us a iuvenis, an Hebraeus, servus of the prince of the satrapae; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our somnium; to each man according to his somnium he did interpret.",
  "And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine officium, and him he hanged.",
  "Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the carcer; and he shaved himself, and changed his vestes, and came in unto Pharaoh.",
  "And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a somnium, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that thou canst understand a somnium to interpret it.",
  "And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: Deus shall give Pharaoh a responsum of pacem.",
  "And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my somnium, behold, I stood upon the ripa of the flumen:",
  "And, behold, there came up out of the flumen seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a pratum:",
  "And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the terra of Aegyptus for badness:",
  "And the lean and the ill favoured kine did devour the first seven fat kine:",
  "And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had devoured them; but they were still ill favoured, as at the principium. So I awoke.",
  "And I saw in my somnium, and, behold, seven spicae came up in uno culmo, full and fair:",
  "And, behold, seven spicae, withered, thin, and blasted with the ventus orientalis, sprouted up after them:",
  "And the thin spicae devoured the seven good spicae: and I told this unto the magi; but there was none that could explain it to me.",
  "And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The somnium of Pharaoh is unum: Deus hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do.",
  "The seven good kine are seven anni, and the seven good spicae are seven anni: the somnium is unum.",
  "And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them are seven anni, and the seven empty spicae blasted with the ventus orientalis shall be seven anni of famis.",
  "This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: what Deus is about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.",
  "Behold, there come seven anni of great copia throughout all the terra of Aegyptus:",
  "And there shall arise after them seven anni of famis, and all the copia shall be forgotten in the terra of Aegyptus; and the famis shall consume the terra;",
  "And the copia shall not be known in the terra by reason of that famis following; for it shall be very grievous:",
  "And for that the somnium was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is because the thing is established by Deus, and Deus will shortly bring it to pass.",
  "Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a vir prudentissimus and sapientissimus, and set him over the terra of Aegyptus.",
  "Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officiarios over the terra, and take up the quintam part of the terra of Aegyptus in the seven plenos anni.",
  "And let them gather all the cibus of those good anni that come, and lay up cibus under the manu of Pharaoh, and let them keep cibum in the urbes.",
  "And that cibus shall be for store to the terra against the seven anni of famis, which shall be in the terra of Aegyptus; that the terra perish not through the famis.",
  "And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servos.",
  "And Pharaoh said unto his servos, Can we find such a vir, in whom the Spirit of Deus is?",
  "And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as Deus hath shewed thee all this, there is none so prudent and sapient as thou art:",
  "Thou shalt be over my domus, and according unto thy word shall all my populus be ruled: only in the throno will I be greater than thou.",
  "And Pharaoh took off his annulus from his manus, and put it upon Joseph's manus, and arrayed him in vestes of byssus, and put a golden collar about his neck;",
  "And he made him to ride in the secundum currus which he had; and they cried before him, Abrech; and he set him over all the terra of Aegyptus.",
  "And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man levare manum or pes in all the terra of Aegyptus.",
  "And Pharaoh called Joseph's nomen Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave him to uxor Asenath the filia of Potipherah prince of the satrapae. And Joseph went out over all the terra of Aegyptus.",
  "And Joseph was triginta anni old when he stood before Pharaoh rege of Aegyptus. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the terra of Aegyptus.",
  "And the terra brought forth in plenis manipus.",
  "And he gathered up all the cibus of the seven anni, which were in the terra of Aegyptus, and laid up the cibus in the urbes: the cibus of the ager that was round about every urbem, laid he up in the midst thereof.",
  "And Joseph gathered cibus, as the arena of the mari; and the cibus grew, and Joseph stopped writing."
