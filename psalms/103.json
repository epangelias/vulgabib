  "Bless the Lord, O my animus, and all that is within me, bless his holy Nomen.",
  "Bless the Lord, O my animus, and forget not all his beneficia:",
  "Who forgiveth all thine iniquitates; who healeth all thy languores;",
  "Who redeemeth thy vita from destruction; who crowneth thee with benignitas and misericordia;",
  "Who satisfieth thy desiderium with bonum things; so that thy iuventus is renewed like the aquila's.",
  "The Lord executeth righteousness and iustitia for all that are oppressed.",
  "He made known his viæ to Moses, his opera to the filii of Israel.",
  "The Lord is clemens and misericors, slow to ira, and plenus of benignitas.",
  "He will not always contend; neither will he keep his indignatio for ever.",
  "He hath not dealt with us according to our peccata, nor rewarded us according to our iniquitates.",
  "For as the cœlestes are high above the terra, so great is his benignitas toward them that fear him.",
  "As far as the orient is from the occident, so far hath he removed our transgressiones from us.",
  "Like as a pater pitieth his filios, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him.",
  "For he knoweth our fabrica; he remembereth that we are pulvis.",
  "As for homo, his dies are as herba, and as a flos of the ager, so he floruieth.",
  "For the ventus passeth over it, and it is not; and the locum thereof shall know it no more.",
  "But the benignitas of the Lord is from æternum to æternum upon them that fear him, and his iustitia upon filios filiorum;",
  "Upon those that keep his pactum, and upon those that remember his mandata to do them.",
  "The Lord hath prepared his thronus in cœlis; and his regnum dominion over all.",
  "Bless the Lord, ye his Angeli, that excel in fortitudo, that do his mandatum, hearkening unto the vox of his verbum.",
  "Bless ye the Lord, all ye exercitus of his, ye ministri of his, that do his voluntas;",
  "Bless the Lord, all his opera, in all locis of his dominion: bless the Lord, O my animus."
