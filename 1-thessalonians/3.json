  "For this cause when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your fides, whether ye stood in the gratia of God.",
  "Therefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone, and sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellow labourer in the Evangelium of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your fides:",
  "That no man should be moved by these afflictiones: for yourselves know that we are ordained thereto.",
  "For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulatio: and it came to pass, as ye know.",
  "For this cause, when I could not forbear, I sent to know your fides, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labour be in vain.",
  "But now when Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us good tidings of your fides and caritas, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also to see you:",
  "Therefore we were comforted in your fides, brethren, and exceedingly rejoiced by reason of all our tribulatio for your sakes.",
  "For, brethren, when we were come from you unto Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without were fightings, within were fears.",
  "Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus;",
  "And not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your zelo, your questioning for us:",
  "For the more part of you had not forgotten your fides and benevolentiam towards us, but ye were sorry for us, as we were sorry for you."
