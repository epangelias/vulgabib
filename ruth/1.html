                    <p>Now it came to pass in the days when the judices were governing, that there was a famine in the terra, and a certain man of Bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the campo of Moab, he and his uxor and his two filiae.</p>
<p>The name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his uxor Naomi, and the name of his two filii Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehemjudah. And they came into the campo of Moab, and continued there.</p>
<p>And Elimelech Naomi's vir died; and she was left, and her two filii.</p>
<p>And they took them uxor of the virgins of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled there about decem years.</p>
<p>Then both Mahlon and Chilion also died; and the mulier was left of her two filii and her vir.</p>
<p>Then she arose with her nurus in law, and returned from the campo of Moab: for she had heard in the campo, how that the Dominus had visited his populus in giving them panem.</p>
<p>Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two nurus in law with her; and they went on the via to return unto the terra of Judah.</p>
<p>And Naomi said unto her nurus in law, Go, return each to her domus of her mater: and the Dominus deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the defuncti, and with me.</p>
<p>The Dominus grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the domus of her vir: then she kissed them; and they lifted up their vox and wept.</p>
<p>And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto thy populus. But Naomi said, Turn again, my filiae: why will ye go with me? are there yet any more filii in my uterum, that they may be viri unto you?</p>
<p>Turn again, my filiae, go your way; for I am too vetus to have a vir. Yea, though I should have an vir this nocte, and also bear filii;</p>
<p>Would ye tarry for them till they were viri? would ye stay for them from being viri? Nay, my filiae; for it grieveth me much for your causa that the manus of the Dominus is gone out against me.</p>
<p>And they lifted up their vox, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mater in law; but Ruth clave unto her.</p>
<p>And she said, Behold, thy mater in law goeth back unto her populus, and unto her dei: return thou after thy mater in law.</p>
<p>And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy populus shall be my populus, and thy Deus my Deus:</p>
<p>Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be sepultus: the Dominus do so to me, and more also, if ought but mors separate me and thee.</p>
<p>When she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her, then she left speaking unto her.</p>
<p>So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the civitas was moved about them, and they said, Is this Naomi?</p>
<p>And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Omnipotens hath dealt very bitterly with me.</p>
<p>I went out full, and the Dominus hath brought me home empty: why then call ye me Naomi, seeing the Dominus hath testified against me, and the Omnipotens hath afflicted me?</p>
<p>So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitis, her nurus in law, with her, which returned out of the campo of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of the messis of hordeum.</p>
