  "And now, saith Dominus, that formed me from the uterus to be His servus, to bring Jacob again unto Him, Though Israel be not gathered, yet shall I be glorious in the oculi of Dominus, and my Deus shall be my fortitudo.",
  "And he said, It is a lumen thing that thou shouldest be my servus to raise up the gentes, and to raise up the preservationes of Israel.",
  "Thus saith Dominus, the Redeemptor of Israel, his Sanctus, to him whom man despises, to him whom the gens abhorreth, to the servus of dominos, Kings shall see and arise, princes also shall worship, because of Dominus that is fidelis, and the Sanctus of Israel, who hath elected thee.",
  "Thus saith Dominus, In an acceptable tempus have I heard thee, and in the dies of salvation have I helped thee: and I will preserve thee, and give thee for a foedus of the populi, to establish the terra, to cause to inherit the desolate hereditates:",
  "That thou mayest say to the prisoners, Go forth; to them that are in darkness, Shew your selves. They shall feed in the ways, and their pastures shall be in all high places.",

  "But Zion said, Dominus hath forsaken me, and my Dominus hath forgotten me.",
  "Can a mulier forget her infans, that she should not have mercy on the filius of her vulva? yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee.",
  "Behold, I have graven thee upon the palmas of my manus; thy muri are continually before me.",
  "Thy filii shall make haste; thy destroyers and they that made thee waste shall go forth of thee.",
  "Lift up thine oculi round about, and behold: all these gather themselves together, and come to thee. As I live, saith Dominus, thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all, as with an ornatus, and thou shalt bind them on thee, as a sponsa doth.",
  "For thy waste and thy desolate places, and the terra of thy destruction, shall even now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitants, and they that swallowed thee up shall be far away.",
  "The filii which thou shalt have, after thou hast lost the other, shall say again in thine aurem, The place is too strait for me: give room that I may dwell.",
  "Then shalt thou say in thine cor, Who hath begotten me these, seeing I have lost my filii, and am desolate, a captive, and removing to and fro? and who hath brought up these? Behold, I was left alone; these, where had they been?",
  "Thus saith Dominus Deus, Behold, I will lift up mine manus to the gentes, and set up my vexillum to the populi: and they shall bring thy filii in their brachiis, and thy filiae shall be carried upon their umeri.",
  "And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their reginae thy nursing matres: they shall bow down to thee with the facies to the terra, and lick up the pulvis of thy pedes; and thou shalt know that I am Dominus: for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me.",
  "Shall the prey be taken from the potentis? or the lawful captivos be delivered?",
  "But thus saith Dominus, Even the captivos of the potentis shall be taken away, and the prey of the tyrannus shall be delivered: for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee, and I will save thy filii.",
  "And I will feed them that oppress thee with their own caro, and they shall be drunken with their own sanguis, as with new vinum: and all caro shall know that I Dominus am thy Salvator and thy Redemptor, the Fortis of Jacob."
