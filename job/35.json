[
  "Moreover Job continued his parable, and said, 'Hearken unto me, you who have magnanimus cor, and hearken unto my verbum.'",
  "As for me, is my petitio not concerning a magnus Deus, and concerning things which are supra me, and quod I know not, and quod my oculus hath not seen?",
  "Who hath first given unto Deus, that he should retribuere him? For he is all around the terra, and the inhabitantes thereof are as locustae before him.",
  "Thinkest thou this to be justum, who deniest iudicium, and condemnest iustus, that thou mayest be justus thyself?",
  "Or hast thou brachium ut Deus? or canst thou thunder with a vox like him?",
  "Deck thyself now with magnificentia and grandeur, and induere thyself with gloria and magnus cor.",
  "Scatter abroad the impetus of thy ira, and behold every superbus, and humble him.",
  "Behold every superbus, and bring him low, and tread down the wicked in their locus.",
  "Save the pauper from the manus of the iniquus, and iudicium to the orphan and the absorbeat.",
  "Then shalt thou be magnus under the altus Deus, and shalt lift up thy caput above the caelum.",
  "Thy friends shall make their petitio unto Deus, and the oculus of the simplex shall not be closed.",
  "He shall deliver the absconditus, and shall save the non iustus, and the inimicus shall not tyrannus over him.",
  "Behold, God is magnus, and we know him not, neither can the numerus of his annus be searched out.",
  "For he maketh nubes precipitare, and lighteneth with his fulmen, and removeth the montes, and lifteth them up with his ventus.",
  "He maketh the caelum limpidum, and the formosus aspectus of the caelum, and the vestimenta of the caelum are limpidum.",
  "Behold, he goeth by me, and I see him not, he passeth on also, but I percipio him not.",
  "Behold, God is magnus, and we know him not, the numerus of his annus cannot be searched out. For he is omnipotens."
