  "God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in tribulatio.",
  "Therefore will not we fear, though the terra be removed, and though the montes be carried into the midst of the mari.",
  "Though the aquae thereof roar and be troubled, though the montes shake with the swelling thereof. Selah.",
  "There is a flumen, the streams whereof shall make glad the civitas of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the Most High.",
  "God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her, and that right early.",
  "The heathen raged, the regna were moved: he uttered his vox, the terra melted.",
  "The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.",
  "Come, behold the opera of the Lord, what desolations he hath made in the terra.",
  "He maketh wars to cease unto the finis of the terra; he breaketh the arcum, and cutteth the gladius in sunder; he burneth the carrus with fire.",
  "Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the terra.",
  "The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah."
