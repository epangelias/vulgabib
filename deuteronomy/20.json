  "When thou goest out to battle against thine enemies, and seest horses, and chariots, and a people more than thou, be not afraid of them: for the Lord thy Deus is with thee, which brought thee up out of the terra of Egypt.",
  "And it shall be, when ye are come nigh unto the civitas which ye shall besiege, that thou shalt offer them pacem.",
  "And it shall be, if they refuse to make pacem with thee, and will make war against thee, then thou shalt besiege it:",
  "And when the Lord thy Deus hath delivered it into thine hands, thou shalt smite every male thereof with the gladius:",
  "But the mulieres, and the parvuli, and the jumenta, and all that is in the civitas, even all the spoil thereof, shalt thou take unto thyself; and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies, which the Lord thy Deus hath given thee.",
  "Thus shalt thou do unto all the civitates which are very far off from thee, which are not of the civitates of these gentes.",
  "But of the civitates of these gentes, which the Lord thy Deus doth give thee for an hereditas, thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth:",
  "But thou shalt utterly destroy them; namely, the Hittites, and the Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; as the Lord thy Deus hath commanded thee:",
  "That they teach you not to do after all their abomination, which they have done unto their dei, so ye sin not against the Lord your Deus.",
  "When thou shalt besiege a civitas a long time, in making war against it to take it, thou shalt not destroy the lignum thereof by forcing an ferrum against it: for thou mayest eat of it, and thou shalt not cut it down (for the lignum of the field is man's life):",
  "Only the lignum which thou knowest that it is not a lignum for meat, thou shalt destroy and cut down; and thou shalt build bulwarks against the civitas that maketh war with thee, until it be subdued."
