                    <p>I lifted up mine oculi, and saw, and behold a vir with a measuring line in his manus.</p>
<p>Then said I, Whither goest tu? And he said unto me, To measure Hierusalem, to see quae sit latitudo eius, and quae sit longitudo eius.</p>
<p>And behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him,</p>
<p>And said unto him, Run, speak to this juvenile, saying, Hierusalem shall be inhabited as towns sine murus, for the multitude of homines and animalia that shall be therein.</p>
<p>For I, saith Dominus, will be unto her a murus ignis round about, and will be the gloria in the midst of her.</p>
<p>Ho, ho, come forth, and flee from the terra of the aquilon, saith Dominus: for I have dispersed you into the quattuor venti of caelum, saith Dominus.</p>
<p>O Sion, escape, thou that dwellest with the filia of Babylon.</p>
<p>For thus saith Dominus of the exercitus, After the gloria hath he sent me unto the gentes which spoiled you: for he that toucheth you toucheth the pupilla of his oculus.</p>
<p>For behold, I will shake mine manus upon them, and they shall be a spoil to their servientes: and ye shall know that Dominus of the exercitus hath sent me.</p>
<p>Sing and rejoice, O filia of Sion: for lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith Dominus.</p>
<p>And many gentes shall be joined to Dominus in that die, and shall be my populus: and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and thou shalt know that Dominus of the exercitus hath sent me unto thee.</p>
<p>And Dominus shall inherit Iudam his part in the terra sancta, and shall choose Hierusalem again.</p>
<p>Be silent, O omnis caro, before Dominus: for he is raised up out of his sanctuarium.</p>
