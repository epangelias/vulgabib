  "Unto thee, O Deus, do we give thanks, to thee do we give thanks: for that thy Nomen is near thy wondrous works declare.",
  "When I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightly.",
  "The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I bear up the pillars of it. Selah.",
  "I said unto the fools, Deal not foolishly: and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn:",
  "Lift not up your horn on high: speak not with a stiff neck.",
  "For promotion cometh neither from the Orient, nor from the Occident, nor from the Meridies.",
  "But Deus is the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another.",
  "For in the manus of the Dominus there is a cup, and the wine is red: it is full of mixture; and he poureth out of the same: but the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the terra shall wring them out, and drink them.",
  "But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the Deus of Iacob.",
  "All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; but the horns of the iustus shall be exalted."
