  "The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the dies of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. ",
  "Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O terra, for the Lord hath spoken, I have nourished and brought up filii, and they have rebelled against me. ",
  "The bovem knoweth his owner, and the asinus his master's crib: but Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider. ",
  "Ah sinful gens, laden with iniquitates, semen of evildoers, filii that deal corruptly: they have forsaken the Lord, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto indignation, and turned their backs unto him. ",
  "Why should ye be beaten any more? ye will revolt more and more: the whole caput is sick, and the whole cor is faint. ",
  "From the planta pedis unto the caput, there is no sanitas in it, but wounds and livores and recentes plagae, not bound up, nor dressed, nor softened with oleum. ",
  "Your terra is desolate, your civitates are burnt with ignis, your terra strangers devour before your faces, and it is desolate as when overthrown by strangers. ",
  "And the filia of Sion shall be left as a tabernaculum in a vineyard, as a watch-tower in a hortus cucumerum, as a besieged civitas. ",
  "Except the Lord of the exercitus had left us a reliquias, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like Gomorrah. ",
  "Hear the word of the Lord, ye princes of Sodom, give ear unto the lex of our God, ye people of Gomorrah. ",
  "To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrificia unto me? saith the Lord: I am full of the holocausta of arietum, and the pinguedo of edomites, and I delight not in the sanguis of boves, or of agni, or of capri. ",
  "When ye venite to apparere before me, who hath required this de manu vestra, that ye should venite in my atria? ",
  "Offer no more oblationes in vain: incensum is abomination unto me; novilunium, and sabati, the convocation I will not endure, for your novilunia and your stationes, the iniquity of your conventicula. ",
  "Your novilunia and your solemnities my animus hateth: they are a burthen unto me; I am weary to bear them. ",
  "And when ye extend manus, I will hide my oculi from you; yea, when ye make multiplicatio orationis, I will not hear: for manus vestrae sunt sanguinolentae. ",
  "Cleanse your manus before me, and abstain from sanguis: learn to do bonum, seek judicium, relieve the oppressus, judicate the pupillus, defende the vidua. ",
  "Venite now, and rationem with me, saith the Lord: if your peccata be as coccinus, they shall be made albus as nix; if they be rubri as sanguis, they shall be albus as lana. ",
  "If ye volueritis, and obediueritis, ye shall eat the bonum of the terra: But if ye refuse and obtemperaveritis not, ye shall be devorati gladio: for the os of the Lord hath spoken it. "
