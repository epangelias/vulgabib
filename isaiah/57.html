                    <p>1. Righteous ones perisheth, and no homo comprehendeth: and merciful men are taketh away, neque is anyone who understandeth that the righteous are taketh away from malum.</p>
<p>2. He entereth into pacem: they rest in their beds, each one walking in his rectus via.</p>
<p>3. But thou, veni, approach hither, ye filii of the sorceress, seminis of the adulterer and the meretrix.</p>
<p>4. Against whom do you jest? Against whom maketh thou a wide os, and prolongas the linguam? Are ye not filii of transgression, a false seed?</p>
<p>5. Inflamming yourselves with idolis under every green arborem, thou sacrificas children in the brooklets, under the clefts of the petrae.</p>
<p>6. In the partes of the brook is thy pars: they, they are thy sorte: and to them thou hast effusus a libation, thou hast offerebas a oblation.</p>
<p>7. Upon a monticello of high elevation, and on a collis thou hast posited thy bed: and thou ascendest up thither to sacrificare.</p>
<p>8. And behind the ostium, and the postis thou hast posited thy memoria: for thou hast reveled against me, and hast multiplicatus thy concubitus.</p>
<p>9. And thou hast trusted in regem with multus unguentum, and hast multiplicatus thy ointments, and hast sent nuntios into Afar, even to Sheol itself.</p>
<p>10. Thou art wearied in the multitudinem of thy vias; yet thou sayest not, 'There is requies': thou hast found vita in thy via, and therefore thou wilt not desist.</p>
<p>11. And for whom hast thou been afraid or feared, that thou hast mentitus, and hast not remembered me, nor taken me in cor?</p>
<p>12. I will declare thy justitia, and thy opera: and they shall not profit thee.</p>
<p>13. When thou criest, let them deliver thee, whom thou hast multiplicatus: let them liberate thee in the tempus of afflictio: for multus is thy numero.</p>
<p>14. And thus dico to those who confidunt in me, Behold, Salvus will be thine. And thou shalt say, Destroy, O Domine, and separate them that afflict me, and draw nigh, and salvare my animus.</p>
<p>15. For thus dicit the Altissimus, Qui habitat in aeternum, Sanctus Nomen ejus, Who dwelleth in sanctuario, in altitudinem and sanctuario dicit: Qui docet quiescere in quietem, and dat munus et quies and sperare in Spe.</p>
<p>16. For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be iratus alway: for spiritus meus and Anima mea with infirmi and solum sufferentes and despiciens and tolerans usque in finem.</p>
<p>17. For the iniquitas of his cupiditas, I was iratus and striked him, and I hid me and was iratus: and he went after cupiditas sui animi.</p>
<p>18. I have seen his vias, and I will sana him, and I will conducere him and restore consolations to him and to those who lugent him.</p>
<p>19. Creating the fructus of the labia: Pacem, pacem, ad longe, et ad proxime, dicit Domine, and Sana all malum.</p>
<p>20. But the impii are similis turbulent sea, qui non potest quiescere, and ejus aquae spumantia sicut cenum et lutum.</p>
<p>21. Non est pax, dicit Dominus Deus meus, impiis.</p>
