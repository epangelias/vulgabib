  "Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab. And Ahaziah fell down through a latticium in his solarium, which was in Samaria, and was vulneratus: therefore he sent messengers, and said unto them, Go, inquire of Baalzebub the deus of Ekron whether I shall recover from this vulneratio.",
  "But the angelus of the Lord said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the rex of Samaria, and say unto them, Is it not because there is no Deus in Israel, that ye go to inquire of Baalzebub the deus of Ekron?",
  "Now therefore thus saith the Lord, Thou shalt not descend from that lectus on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely mori. And Elijah departed.",
  "And when the messengers turned back unto him, he said unto them, Why are ye now turned back? And they said unto him, There came a vir up to meet us, and said unto us, Go, turn again unto the rex which sent you, and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord, Is it not because there is no Deus in Israel, that thou sendest to inquire of Baalzebub the deus of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not descend from that lectus on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely mori.",
  "And he said unto them, What manner of vir was he which came up to meet you, and told you these words? And they answered him, He was an vir in a pilus of hair, with a zona of leather about his lumbus. And he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.",
  "Again also he sent unto him another legatio of fifty men. And the prince of the second fifty said unto him, O man of God, thus hath the rex said, Come down quickly. And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I be a vir of God, let ignis come down from caelum, and consume thee and thy fifty. And the ignis of God came down from caelum, and consumed him and his fifty.",
  "And again he sent the tertius legatio of fifty men. And the prince of the tertius fifty went up, and came and fell on his genua before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my anima, and the animae of these fifty thy servi, be precious in thy sight.",
  "Behold, there came ignis down from caelum, and burnt up the duos former legationes of fifty men with their princes: therefore let my anima now be precious in thy sight. And the angelus of the Lord said unto Elijah, Go down with him: be not timoros of him. And he arose, and went down with him unto the rex.",
  "And he said unto him, Thus saith the Lord, Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to inquire of Baalzebub the deus of Ekron, is it not because there is no Deus in Israel to inquire of his verbum? therefore thou shalt not descend from that lectus on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely mori.",
  "So he mori according to the verbum of the Lord which Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram his frater reigned in his stead in the secundus year of Jehoram the filius of Jehoshaphat rex of Judah; because he had no filius.",
  "Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the libro of the chronicles of the reges of Israel?",
  "And when the Lord would take up Elijah into caelum by a tempest, Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.",
  "And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the Lord hath sent me to Bethel. And Elisha said unto him, As the Lord liveth, and as thy anima liveth, I will not leave thee. So they went down to Bethel.",
  "And the filii of the prophets that were at Bethel came forth to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Lord will take away thy dominus from thy caput to day? And he said, Yea, I know it; hold your os.",
  "And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the Lord hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, As the Lord liveth, and as thy anima liveth, I will not leave thee. So they came to Jericho.",
  "And the filii of the prophets that were at Jericho came near to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Lord will take away thy dominus from thy caput to day? And he said, Yea, I know it; hold your os.",
  "And Elijah said unto him, Tarry, I pray thee, here; for the Lord hath sent me to Jordan. And he said, As the Lord liveth, and as thy anima liveth, I will not leave thee. And they two went on.",
  "And fifty men of the filii of the prophets went, and stood to view afar off: and they two stood by Jordan.",
  "And Elijah took his pallium, and wrapped it together, and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went over on dry terra.",
  "And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a duplum portion of thy spirit be upon me.",
  "And he said, Thou hast asked a difficile thing: nevertheless, if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be so.",
  "And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a currus of ignis, and equi of ignis, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a tempest into caelum.",
  "And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My pater, my pater, the currus of Israel, and the equites thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own vestes, and rent them in two pieces.",
  "He took up also the pallium of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan;",
  "And he took the pallium of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is the Deus of Elijah, even he? and when he also had smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither: and Elisha went over.",
  "And when the filii of the prophets which were to view at Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the terra before him."
