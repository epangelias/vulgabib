  "And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead, said unto Ahab, As Dominus liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor imber for these annos, but according to my verbum.",
  "Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that is before Iordanum, and it shall be, when thou shalt drink of the brook, and I have commanded the corvi to feed thee there.",
  "So he went and did according unto the verbum of Dominus: for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that is before Iordanum.",
  "And the corvi brought him panem and carnes in the mane, and panem and carnes in the vespera; and he drank of the brook.",
  "And it came to pass after certi dies, that the brook dried up, because there had not been imber in terra.",
  "And the verbum of Dominus came unto him, saying, Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Sidon, and dwell there: behold, I have commanded a vidua there to sustain thee.",
  "So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the porta of the civitas, behold, the vidua was there gathering ligna: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little aqua in a vessel, that I may drink.",
  "And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsell of panis in thy manus.",
  "And she said, As Dominus thy Deus liveth, I have not a cake, but a morsell of meal in a vessel, and a little oleum in a cruet: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my filius, that we may eat it, and die.",
  "And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it unto me, and after make for thee and for thy filius.",
  "For thus saith Dominus Deus of Israel, The vessel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruet of oleum fail, until the dies that Dominus sendeth imber upon terra.",
  "And she went and did according to the verbum of Elijah: and she, and he, and her domus, did eat many dies.",
  "And the vessel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruet of oleum fail, according to the verbum of Dominus, which he spake by Elijah.",
  "And it came to pass after these things, that the filius of the vidua fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him.",
  "And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O vir Dei? art thou come unto me to bring my peccata to memoria, and to slay my filius?",
  "And Elijah said unto her, Give me thy filius. And he took him out of her manus, and carried him up into a coenaculum, where he abode, and laid him upon his own lectus.",
  "And he cried unto Dominus, and said, O Dominus my Deus, hast thou also brought calamitas upon the vidua with whom I sojourn, by slaying her filius?",
  "And he stretched himself upon the filius three times, and cried unto Dominus, and said, O Dominus my Deus, I pray thee, let this filius's anima come into him again.",
  "And Dominus heard the vox of Elijah; and the anima of the filius came into him again, and he revived.",
  "And Elijah took the filius, and brought him down out of the coenaculum into the domus, and delivered him unto his mater: and Elijah said, See, thy filius liveth.",
  "And the vidua said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou art a vir Dei, and that the verbum of Dominus in thy os is veritas."
