  "The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in veritas.",
  "Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in good sanitas, even as thy animus prospereth.",
  "For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the veritas that is in thee, even as thou walkest in veritas.",
  "I have no greater joya than to hear that my children walk in veritas.",
  "Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers;",
  "Who have borne witness of thy caritas before the ecclesia: whom thou shalt do well to send forward on their journeya after a godly sort.",
  "Because that for nomen Dei they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.",
  "We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers to the veritas.",
  "I wrote unto the ecclesia: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the principatus among them, receiveth us not.",
  "Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his opera which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out of the ecclesia.",
  "Beloved, follow not that which is malum, but that which is bonum. He that doeth bonum is of Deus, but he that doeth malum hath not seen Deus.",
  "Demetrius hath good witness of all men, and of the veritas itself: yea, this thou knowest, that our testimonium is vera.",
  "I had many things to write unto thee, but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee:",
  "Yet I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak facie to facie. Pax be to thee. Our friends salute thee. Greet the friends by nomen."
