  "Woe to them that are at ease in Zion, and trust in the montibus of Samaria, which are named caput in the chief of the nations, to whom the domus of Israel come!",
  "Pass ye unto Calneh, and see; and from thence go ye to Hamath the great: then go down to Gath of the Philistines: be they better than these regna? or their terminus greater than your terminus?",
  "Ye that put far away the diem of affliction, that cause the scabellum of violence to come near;",
  "That lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their lecti, and eat the agni of the flock, and the calves out of the midst of the stall;",
  "That chant to the sonus of the psalterium, and invent to themselves instrumenta musica like David;",
  "That drink from the cratera of wine, and anoint themselves with the best unguenta: but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph.",
  "Therefore now shall they go captive with the prima of the captives, and the convivium of the luxurious shall take away.",
  "The Dominus God hath sworn by himself, saith the Dominus God the God of exercituum, I abhor the superbia of Jacob, and hate his palatia: therefore will I deliver up the civitas with all that is therein.",
  "And it shall come to pass, if there remain decem homines in one domus, that they shall die.",
  "And a man's uncle shall take him up, and he that burneth him, to bring out the ossa out of the domus, and shall say unto him that is in the sides of the domus, Is there yet any with thee? and he shall say, None. Then shall he say, Tace, for we may not make mention of the nomen Domini.",
  "For behold, the Dominus commandeth, and he will smite the magna domus with fissures, and the parva domus with rifts.",
  "Shall horses run upon the petra? or will men plow there with boves? for ye have turned judgment into avena, and the fructus of righteousness into absintheum.",
  "Ye who rejoice in a die, who say, Is not the diem of the festum near, when the mercatores shall make an end of buying and selling?",
  "Ye say, When will the mensis be gone, that we may sell grain? and the Sabbath, that we may set forth wheat, making the ephah small and the shekel great, and falsifying the statera of deceit;",
  "That we may buy the pauper for argentum, and the egenum for a pair of calcei, and sell the refusa of the wheat?",
  "Shall not the terra tremble for this, and every habitator in her mourn?",
  "Yea, the terra shall be in motione, as a navis on the mare, and she shall be moved, and shall not cease, as the Mare rubrum when it floweth over.",
  "In that diem I will make the stellae of the caelum to fall, and the stellae of the firmament to be dark: and I will cover the solem with a nebula, and the lunam with a caligo, and I will turn the diem into noctem.",
  "And I will shew wonders in the caelum and in the terra, sanguinem, and fire, and pillars of fumus.",
  "The sun shall be turned into tenebrae, and the moon into sanguis, before the great and terrible diem of the Lord come.",
  "And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the nomen of the Dominus shall be saved: for in Monte Zion and in Jerusalem shall be salvus, as the Dominus hath said, and in the remnant whom the Dominus shall call."
