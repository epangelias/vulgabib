                    <p>And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the tertius month, in the prima day of the month, that the verbum Domini came unto me, saying,</p>
<p>Son of man, speak unto Pharaon rex Aegypti, and to his multitudo; Whom art thou like in thy magnitudo?</p>
<p>Behold, the Assyrius was a cedrus in Lebanon with fair rami, and with umbra that was densa, and of altitudo eximius, and his summitus was inter nubes.</p>
<p>The aquae made him grow, the abyssus exaltavit him: he went forth with fluvius, and his rivus went forth round about his radix, and sent out his rivi to all the arbores of the field.</p>
<p>Therefore his altitudo was exalted above all the arbores of the field, and his rami were multiplicati, and his rami were prolongati, because of the multis aquae, when he gave his radix toward him.</p>
<p>All the aves caeli made their nidi in his rami, and under his rami pulchrae bestiae universae genu epigrafe, and under his umbra habitabant omnes gentes.</p>
<p>And he was pulcher in sua magnitudine, in extensione rami eius: because his radix was toward the aquae, and sent out his rivi unto all the arbores of the field.</p>
<p>Thus he was fair in sua pulchritudine, with the multitudo rami sui: for his radix was toward the multis aquae.</p>
<p>The cedri in paradiso Dei were not similes ei, the cypressi non aequabant summitus eius, and the pinei non erant ut rami eius: none of the arbores in paradiso Dei were similes ei in sua pulchritudine.</p>
<p>I have made him fair by the multitudo rami sui: and all the arbores of paradiso, which were in Eden, were aemulati eius.</p>
<p>Therefore thus dixit Dominus Deus; Because thou art exaltatus in altitudine, and he hath set his summitus inter nubes, and his cor has been elevatum in sua pulchritudine:</p>
<p>I have eiecit te, O cedar, with the electi of the gentes: and I have proiectus te with the arbores of paradiso in infernum, ad utrumque latere abyssus: and thou shalt dormires cum incircumcisis, with gladio vulneratis, qui descenderunt ad lacum.</p>
<p>To whom art thou thus similes, O Pharaon rex, and thy multitudo? says Dominus Deus.</p>
<p>Behold, the Assyrius was a cedrus in Lebanon with fair rami, and with umbra that was densa, and of altitudo eximius, and his summitus was inter nubes.</p>
<p>The aquae made him grow, the abyssus exaltavit him: he went forth with fluvius, and his rivus went forth round about his radix, and sent out his rivi to all the arbores of the field:</p>
<p>Therefore his altitudo was exalted above all the arbores of the field, and his rami were multiplicati, and his rami were prolongati, because of the multis aquae, when he gave his radix toward him.</p>
<p>All the aves caeli made their nidi in his rami, and under his rami pulchrae bestiae universae genu epigrafe, and under his umbra habitabant omnes gentes.</p>
<p>And he was pulcher in sua magnitudine, in extensione rami eius: because his radix was toward the aquae, and sent out his rivi unto all the arbores of the field.</p>
<p>Thus he was fair in sua pulchritudine, with the multitudo rami sui: for his radix was toward the multis aquae.</p>
<p>I the Dominus have spoken and have done it: I have eiecit him; the gentes have desolati him, and the venti have proiectus him: and the natio is extincta, and his radix, and his rivi, and his rami, and his umbra.</p>
<p>And it came to pass in the tertius decade of the tertius mensis, that there came alienuae, of the principes of Israel unto me, that dwelt in the land, even they sat before me.</p>
<p>And the verbum Domini came unto me, saying,</p>
<p>Son of man, speak unto the domus Israel, and say unto them, Thus says Dominus Deus; Behold, I will profanare my sanctuarium, the excellentiam of your potentia, the desiderium of your oculi, and the pitietas of your animus: and your filii, and your filiae, whom ye have left behind, shall fall by gladio.</p>
<p>And ye shall know that I am Dominus: when I have profanatum my sanctuarium, because of all your abominationes, and your iniquitates, and I have finitum my indignation in vos.</p>
<p>And the prophetia of Ezekiel was consummata, and Ezekiel clamavit in auribus eorum, saying, A facinus, a facinus, a facinus, is factum in the civitas of blood.</p>
<p>Every forma of pestis and omnis genus of calamitatis is come upon her; augebitur the famina, and consumetur the pestis, and the gladius is in the terra, and the pestis is in the civitas:</p>
<p>The gladius is given to be slaying in the terra, and the pestis in the civitas, to augeo the famina and the calamitatis, and to convertere the potentia in the terra, and to scindere the armos of the potentia in the terra:</p>
<p>That every forma of manus may faint, and every cor may melt, and all the animus may faint, and all the genua may be languidi as aquae: behold, it comes, and shall be factum, says Dominus Deus.</p>
<p>It comes, and he shall give it to the vallum, and the gladius to the terra, and the pestis to the civitas, and I will vocare the gentes, and I will congregare the multitudo, and I will dare the reges, that they may give gladium contra te in every forma of gladii, and I will profanare my sanctuarium, the excellentiam of your potentia, and the desiderium of your oculi, and the pitietas of your animus, and your filii, and your filiae, whom you have left behind, shall fall by gladio.</p>
