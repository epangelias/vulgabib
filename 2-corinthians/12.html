                    <p>It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelatios.</p>
<p>I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in corpus, I know not: or whether out of corpus, I know not, Deus scit) such an one caught up to tertius caelum.</p>
<p>And I knew such a man, (whether in corpus, or out of corpus, I know not: Deus scit)</p>
<p>How that he was caught up into paradisus, and heard arcana verba, which it is not licit for hominem to loqui.</p>
<p>Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in infirmitatibus meae.</p>
<p>For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be insipiens: for I say the veritas: but now I forbear, lest any man should put me above id, quod in me videt, aut quod in me audit.</p>
<p>And lest I should be exaltatus above mensuram, per abundantiam revelationum, there was given me a stimulus carnis, angelus Satanae, qui me colaphizaret.</p>
<p>For which thing I besought Dominum ter, that it might depart from me.</p>
<p>And he said unto me, Gratia mea te sufficit: nam virtus in infirmitate perficitur. Itaque libenter gloriabor in infirmitatibus meis, ut inhabitet in me virtus Christi.</p>
<p>Wherefore I take pleasure in infirmitatibus, in contumeliis, in necessitatibus, in persecutionibus, in angustiis, pro Christo: for when I am infirmus, then I am fortis.</p>
<p>I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nihil I was inferior to summi Apostoli, though I be nihil.</p>
<p>Truly the signa Apostolorum were wrought among you in patientia, in signis, et prodigiis, et virtutibus.</p>
<p>For what is it wherein ye were inferior to Ecclesiae, nisi in eo quod non fui gravosus vobis? Excuse me this injury.</p>
<p>Behold, for the tertiam I prepare to venire ad vos; and I will not be gravosus ad vos: for I seek not vestra, sed vos: for filii debent thesaurizare parentibus, non autem parentes filiis.</p>
<p>But I will very gladly spend, and be spent for animas vestras: though I love vos plus, minus amabor.</p>
<p>But be it so, I did not burden vos: sed being crafty, I caught vos per astutiam.</p>
<p>Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you?</p>
<p>I desired Titum, and with him I sent a fratrem: did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in eodem spiritu? walked we not in eisdem vestigiis?</p>
<p>Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before Deus in Christo: but we do all things, dilecti, for vestra edificationem.</p>
<p>For I fear, lest, when I venire, I shall not find vos such as I would, and that I shall be found unto vos such as ye would not, lest there be contentiones, aemulationes, irae, simultates, detractiones, whisperings, tumores, seditiones:</p>
<p>Lest when I come again, my Deus will humble me among you, and that I shall bewail many which have peccatum already, and have not repented of the impurities, and fornicationes, and impudicitia which they have committed.</p>
