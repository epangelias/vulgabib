  "The burden of Moab. Because in the night Ar non is laid waste, and is cut off, the fortis of Moab is destroyed, because in the night Kir of Moab is laid waste, and is cut off.",
  "He is gone up to Bajith, and to Dibon, the excelsus places, to weep: Moab shall howl over Nebo, and over Medeba: on all their heads shall be baldness, and every beard cut off.",
  "In their strata they shall gird themselves with sackcloth: on the tops of their houses, and in their strata, every one shall howl, weeping abundantly.",
  "And Heshbon shall cry, and Elealeh: their vox shall be heard even unto Jahaz: therefore the armed soldiers of Moab shall cry out; his animus shall be sore afraid.",
  "My cor shall cry out for Moab; his fugitives shall flee unto Zoar, an heifer of three annis: for by the ascending of Luhith with weeping shall they go it up; for in the way of Horonaim they shall raise up a clamor of destruction.",
  "For the aquae of Nimrim shall be desolate: for the herba is withered away, the floris is decayed, and the fructus is failed.",
  "Therefore the remnant of the fructus that they have laid up they shall carry away to the torrent of the salices.",
  "For the clamor is gone round about the terminus of Moab; the howling thereof unto Eglaim, and the howling thereof unto Beerelim.",
  "For the aquae of Dimon shall be full of sanguine: for I will bring super Moab the leon, even him that escapeth of the chosen young men."
