                    <p>In the tenth year, in the tenth month, in the twelfth day of the month, the word of the Domini came to me, saying,</p>
<p>Fili hominis, set thy face against Pharaonem king of Aegyptum, and prophesy against him, and against totam Aegyptum:</p>
<p>Speak, and say, Thus saith Dominus Deus; Behold, I am against thee, Pharaonem king of Aegyptum, the great dragon that lieth in the midst of his flumen, which hath said, My flumen is mine own, and I have made it for myself.</p>
<p>But I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the pisces of thy flumen to stick unto thy scales, and I will bring thee up out of the midst of thy flumen, and all the pisces of thy flumen shall stick unto thy scales.</p>
<p>And I will leave thee thrown into the wilderness, thee and all the pisces of thy flumen: thou shalt fall upon the face of the field; thou shalt not be brought together, nor gathered: I have given thee for meat to the beasts of the field and to the volucres of the heaven.</p>
<p>And all the inhabitants of Aegyptus shall know that I am the Domini, because they have been a staff of reed to the domus of Israel.</p>
<p>When they took hold of thee by thy bracchium, thou didst break, and rend all their shoulder: and when they leaned upon thee, thou brakest, and madest all their sides to stand.</p>
<p>Therefore thus saith Dominus Deus; Behold, I will bring a gladius upon thee, and cut off from thee hominem and beast.</p>
<p>And the land of Aegyptus shall be desolate and waste; and they shall know that I am the Domini: because he hath said, The flumen is mine, and I have made it.</p>
<p>Behold, therefore I am against thee, and against thy flumen, and I will make the land of Aegyptus utterly waste and desolate, from the tower of Syene even unto the terminus of it.</p>
<p>No foot of hominis shall pass through it, nor foot of animus, neither shall it be inhabited forty years.</p>
<p>And I will make the land of Aegyptus among the desolate countries, and her cities among the cities that are laid waste, and they shall be desolate forty years: and I will scatter the Aegyptios among the gentes, and will disperse them through the terrae.</p>
<p>Yet thus saith Dominus Deus; At the end of forty years will I gather the Aegyptios from the populis where they were scattered:</p>
<p>And I will bring them again into the terra of Pathros, into the land of their nativitas, and they shall be there a modicus kingdom.</p>
<p>It shall be the lowest of the kingdoms; neither shall it exalt itself any more above the gentes: for I will diminish them, that they shall no more rule over the gentes.</p>
<p>And it shall be no more the confidentia of the domus of Israel, which bringeth to mind the iniquitatem of them, when they took after them: and they shall know that I am Dominus Deus.</p>
<p>And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the first month, in the first day of the month, the word of the Domini came unto me, saying,</p>
<p>Fili hominis, Nebuchadrezzar rex of Babylon caused his exercitum to serve a great servitium against Tyrum: every head was made bald, and every shoulder was peeled: yet had he no wages, nor his exercitum, for Tyrum, for the servitium that he had served against it:</p>
<p>Therefore thus saith Dominus Deus; Behold, I will give the land of Aegyptus to Nebuchadrezzar rex of Babylon; and he shall take her multitude, and take her spoil, and take her prey; and it shall be the wages for his exercitum.</p>
