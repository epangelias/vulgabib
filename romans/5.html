                    <p>Therefore being iustified by fide, we have pax with Deus through our Dominus Iesus Christ:</p>
<p>By whom also we have access by fide into this gratia wherein we stand, and reioyce in hope of the gloria of Deus.</p>
<p>And not only so, but we gloriabimur also in tribulationes: knowing that tribulatio worketh patientiam;</p>
<p>And patientia, probationem: and probation, spem:</p>
<p>And spem maketh not confusum: because the caritas of Deus is shed abroad in our cordibus by the Holy Spirit, qui is giuen vnto vs.</p>
<p>For when we were yet infirmi, Christus died for vs, according to the tempus.</p>
<p>Scarce for a iustus man will one die: yea perhaps for a bonus man some one might be bolde to die.</p>
<p>But Deus commendeth his caritas towards vs, in that, while we were yet peccatores, Christus died for vs.</p>
<p>Much more then, being now iustified by his sanguis, we shall be salui from ira through him.</p>
<p>For if, when we were inimici, we were reconciliati to Deus by the morte of his Filii: much more, being reconciliati, we shall be salui by his vita.</p>
<p>And not only so, but we also gloriabimur in Deus through our Dominus Iesus Christ, by whom we haue now receiued reconciliatio.</p>
<p>Wherefore, as by one homo peccatum entred into the mundus, and by peccatum mors: and so mors pertransiit in omnes homines, in whom all haue sinned:</p>
<p>(For vnto the lex sinne was in the mundus: but sinne is not imputed, when there is no lex.</p>
<p>Neuerthelesse, mors reigned from Adam to Moses, euen ouer them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adams transgression, who is the figura of him that was to come:</p>
<p>But not as the delictum, so also is the donum: for if through the delictum of one many be dead: much more the gratia of Deus, and the donum by gratia, which is by one homo, Iesus Christ, hath abounded vnto many.</p>
<p>And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the donum: for the iudicium was by one to condemnation: but the donum is of many delicta vnto iustificatio.</p>
<p>For if by one mans delictum mors reigned by one: much more they which receiue abundance of gratia, and of the donum of iustitiam, shall reigne in vita by one, Iesus Christ.</p>
<p>Therefore as by the delictum of one iudgement came vpon all men to condemnation: euen so by the iustitia of one, the donum came vpon all men vnto iustificatio of vita.</p>
<p>For as by one mans disobedientia many were made peccatores: so by the obedientia of one, shall many be made iusti.</p>
<p>The lex entred that the delictum might abound: but where sinne abounded, gratia did much more abound:</p>
<p>That as sinne hath reigned vnto mors: euen so might gratia reigne through iustitiam vnto aeternam vitam, by Iesus Christ our Dominus.</p>
