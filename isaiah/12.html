                    <p>And in that day thou shalt say, O Domine, I will praise thee: though thou wast angry with me, thine ira is turned away, and thou comfortedst me.</p>
<p>Behold, Deus is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for the Domine Deus is my fortitudo and my canticum; he also is become my salvus.</p>
<p>Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the fontes of salvus.</p>
<p>And in that day shall ye say, Praise the Domine, call upon his nomine, declare his opera among the people, make mention that his nomine is exalted.</p>
<p>Sing unto the Domine; for he hath done excellentia: this is known in all the terra.</p>
<p>Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Sion: for great is the Sanctus in the midst of thee; he is the Sanctus of Israel.</p>
