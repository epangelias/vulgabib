                    <p>It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty principes, or 'ducēs',</p>
<p>That the king should have no damage, or 'dammum',</p>
<p>Now the 'satrapæ' the 'ducēs' and the 'principes' sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom;</p>
<p>Then the 'satrapæ' the 'ducēs' and the 'principes' assembled together to the king, and thus said unto him, Keep the king's 'decetum' that there be no petition made to any God or man for thirty days, save to thee, O king:</p>
<p>And whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man within thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions, 'leo',</p>
<p>Now, O king, establish the 'decetum' and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and 'Persæ', which altereth not.</p>
<p>Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the 'decetum',</p>
<p>Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.</p>
<p>Then these men assembled, and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God.</p>
<p>Then they came near, and spake before the king concerning the king's 'decetum'; Hast thou not signed a 'decetum' that every man that shall ask a petition of any God or man within thirty days, save of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions?</p>
<p>The king answered and said, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and 'Persæ', which altereth not.</p>
<p>Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions.</p>
<p>Now the king spake and said unto Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee.</p>
<p>And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his 'nobilēs'; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel.</p>
<p>Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting: neither were instruments of musick brought before him: and his sleep went from him.</p>
<p>Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions.</p>
<p>And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice unto Daniel: and the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God whom thou servest continually able to deliver thee from the lions?</p>
<p>Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live for ever.</p>
<p>My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I offended nothing.</p>
<p>Then was the king exceeding glad for him, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den.</p>
<p>So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in his God.</p>
<p>And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions overcame them, and brake all their bones in pieces or 'ossibus', before they came at the bottom of the den.</p>
<p>Then king Darius wrote unto all people, 'natio', nations, and languages, that dwelt in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you.</p>
<p>I make a 'decetum' that in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he is the living God, and steadfast for ever, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion shall be even unto the end.</p>
<p>He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.</p>
<p>So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the 'Persæ',</p>
