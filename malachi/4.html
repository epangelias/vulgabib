                    <p>For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an ignis, and all the superbos shall be stipula, and the day that cometh shall exurere them, saith Dominus exercituum, it shall leave them neither radix, nor ramus.</p>
<p>But unto you that fear my nomen, the Sol justitiae shall arise with sanitas in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as vituli of the herd.</p>
<p>And ye shall calcatrum the wicked; for they shall be cinis under the planta of your pedes in the die which I make, saith Dominus exercituum.</p>
<p>Remember ye the legem of Moses my servus, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, with the statuta and the judicia.</p>
<p>Behold, I will send you Elijah the propheta before the advent of the great and horribilis die of the Lord:</p>
<p>And he shall convert the cor of the patres to the filii, and the cor of the filii to their patres, lest I come and percutiam the terram with maledictio.</p>
