  "Beatus is the man whose transgressio is forgiven, whose peccatum is covered.",
  "Blessed is the homo unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquitas, and in whose spirit there is no dolus.",
  "When I kept silence, my ossa waxed old through my roaring all the diem.",
  "For day and night thy manus were heavy upon me: my vitalis sap is turned in the aestus of summer. Selah.",
  "I acknowledged my peccata unto thee, and mine iniquitates have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressiones unto the Lord; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my peccatum. Selah.",
  "For this shall every sanctus homo pray unto thee in a tempus of finding: surely in the inundatio of many aquae the flumen shall not come nigh unto him.",
  "Thou art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from tribulatio: thou shalt compass me about with cantica of deliverance. Selah.",
  "I will instruct thee and teach thee in the via which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine oculus.",
  "Be ye not like the equus, or like the asinus, which have no intellectus: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near unto thee.",
  "Many are the afflictiones of the iustus: but the Lord delivereth him out of them all.",
  "He keepeth all his ossa: not one of them is fracted.",
  "Malitia shall slay the impium: and they that hate the iustum shall be desolati.",
  "The Lord redeemeth the anima of his servus: and none of them that trust in him shall be desolati."
