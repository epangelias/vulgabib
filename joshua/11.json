  "And it came to pass, quando Josue and all Israel were finished, slew them with gladio, until they were destroyed, quemadmodum Dominus praeceperat eos.",
  "Neque relicti sunt, qui potuerunt eos interficere, sed quicumque effugerant, venerunt in civitates munitas.",
  "And Israel reversus est in castris suis in Silo. Now Josue took them all, quae potuit comprehendi, regem, and interfecebat eos gladio, quemadmodum praeceperat Dominus servo suo Mosen.",
  "And Josue transivit, omniaque vastavit in tempore, quemadmodum praeceperat Dominus, from the regionem montuosam to the desert, et usque to all the land of Galaad, and the west of it to the regionem Arabim, as well as from Hebron usque to the orientalem plagam the mountain of Chanaan.",
  "Now Josue, at ille time, slew the king of Eglon, uno tractu gladio cum his qui erant in Hebron.",
  "He and his exercitus very strongly fought contra Libnan, yet no homo potuit resistere ante eos.",
  "Et exterminavit Josue, secundum verbum Domini, all who erant in regione montuosa and Galaad and in lowland of Silo, to the inclitas Scithopolim and in orientalem plagam usque Bethoron and from the orientalem plagam of the Bethelites in Bethoron usque in maritime."
