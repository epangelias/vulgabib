                    <p>And the ark of the Lord was in the country of the Philistines seven months. And the Philistines called for the sacerdotes and the diviners, saying, What shall we do to the ark of the Lord? tell us wherewith we shall send it to his locus.</p>
<p>And they said, If ye send away the ark of the Deus of Israel, send it not emptius, but return him a piaculum: then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his manus is not turned away from you.</p>
<p>Then they said, What shall be the piaculum which we shall return to him? They answered, Five golden tumores, and five golden mice, according to the number of the dominus of the Philistines: for one plague was on you all, and on your dominus: make ye therefore images of your tumores, and images of your mice that maraud your terram;</p>
<p>And give glory to the Deus of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his manus from off you, and from off your deus, and from off your terram.</p>
<p>Wherefore then do ye harden your corda, as the Aegyptii and Pharaon hardened their corda? when he had wrought wonderfully among them, did they not let the populus go, and they departed?</p>
<p>Now therefore make a new cart, and take two cows that have calved, on which there hath come no iugum, and tie the cows to the cart, and bring their calves home from them:</p>
<p>And take the ark of the Deus, and lay it upon the cart; and put the jewels of gold, which ye return him for a piaculum, in a coffer by the side thereof; and send it away, that it may go.</p>
<p>And see, if it goeth up by the way of his own terram to Bethsames, then he hath done us this great malum: but if not, then we shall know that it is not his manus that smote us; it was a casus that happened to us.</p>
<p>And the men did so; and took two cows that had calved, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home:</p>
<p>And they laid the ark of the Deus upon the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their tumores.</p>
<p>And the cows took the straight way to the way of Bethsames, and went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left; and the dominus of the Philistines went after them, unto the border of Bethsames.</p>
<p>And they of Bethsames were reaping their wheat harvest in the valles: and they lifted up their oculi, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it.</p>
<p>And the cart came into the field of Iosue, a Bethsamite, and stood there, where there was a great petra: and they clave the wood of the cart, and offered the cows a holocaust to the Deus.</p>
<p>And the Levites took down the ark of the Deus, and the coffer that was with it, wherein the jewels of gold were, and put them on the great petra: and the men of Bethsames offered holocausts and made sacrificia that day unto the Deus.</p>
<p>And when the five dominus of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron the same day.</p>
<p>These are the golden tumores which the Philistines returned for a piaculum to the Deus: for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Ascalon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one;</p>
<p>And the golden mice, according to the number of all the urbes of the Philistines pertaining to the five dominus, from the fenced urbs to the urbs of the village, even unto the great petra of Abel, whereon they set down the ark of the Deus unto this day.</p>
<p>And he smote the men of Bethsames, because they had looked into the ark of the Deus, even he smote of the populus fifty thousand and threescore and ten men: and the people lamented, because the Deus had smitten many of the populus, and because he had smitten the populus with a great plaga.</p>
<p>And the men of Bethsames said, Who is able to stand before this Deus Sanctus? to whom shall he go up from us?</p>
<p>And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjathjearim, saying, The Philistines have brought again the ark of the Deus; come ye down, and fetch it up to you.</p>
