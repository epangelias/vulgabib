                    <p>And it came to pass, that after we were gotten from them, we came with a directio, to the next day to Puteoli:</p>
<p>Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven dies.</p>
<p>And so we went toward Roma.</p>
<p>And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three tabernacles: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.</p>
<p>And when we came to Roma, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the praefectus of the castrum, but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.</p>
<p>And it came to pass, that after three dies Paul called the principes of the Iudaei together: and when they were come, he said unto them, Men and brethren, though I have committed nothing against the populus, or the traditiones of our patres, yet was I delivered prisoner from Hierosolyma into the manus of the Romanorum.</p>
<p>Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because there was no causa of death in me.</p>
<p>But when the Iudaei spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.</p>
<p>For this causa therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the sperantia of Israel I am bound with this catena.</p>
<p>And they said unto him, We neither received litteras out of Iudaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harme of thee.</p>
<p>But we desire to hear of thee, what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.</p>
<p>And when they had appointed him a dies, there came many to him into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the regnum of God, and persuaded them of Jesus, both out of the Leges of Moyses, and out of the Prophetis, from morning till evening.</p>
<p>And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.</p>
<p>And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Spiritus Sanctus by Esaias the propheta unto our patres,</p>
<p>Saying, Go unto this populus, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:</p>
<p>For the cor of this populus is waxed gross, and their aures are dull of hearing, and their oculi have they closed; lest they should see with their oculi, and hear with their aures, and understand with their cor, and should be converted, and I should heal them.</p>
<p>Be it known therefore unto you, that the salus of God is sent unto the Gentes, and that they will hear it.</p>
<p>And when he had said these words, the Iudaei departed, and had great disputatio among themselves.</p>
<p>And Paul dwelt two anni in his own hired domus, and received all that came in unto him,</p>
<p>Preaching the regnum of God, and teaching the things which concern the Domini Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.</p>
