                    <p>Bow down thine auris, O Deus, and hear: open thine oculus, and see; and hear my vox.</p>
<p>For I will dire for thee, and thy populus Israel, that they may give thee donum and offer sacrificium.</p>
<p>Thou hast shown favour unto thy terra, O Deus; thou hast brought back captivus of Jacob.</p>
<p>Thou hast forgiven iniquitas of thy populus, thou hast covered omnis peccatum.</p>
<p>Selah.</p>
<p>Take away all ira, and quiesce indignatio: and be thou pacificus.</p>
<p>Turn us, O Deus salutaris, and cause thy facies to shine.</p>
<p>Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy populus may rejoice in thee?</p>
<p>Shew us thy misericordia, O Deus, and grant us thy salus.</p>
<p>I will hear what Deus the Dominus will speak: for he will speak pacem unto his populus, and to his sancti: but let them not turn again to stultitia.</p>
<p>Surely his salus is nigh them that timorem Deum; that gloria may habitare in terra nostra.</p>
<p>Misericordia and veritas are met together; justitia and pax have kissed each other.</p>
<p>Veritas shall flourish out of terra; and justitia shall look down from caelum.</p>
<p>Yea, Deus shall give what is bonum; and terra nostra shall give her fructus.</p>
<p>Justitia shall go before him; and shall set in via gressus ejus.</p>
