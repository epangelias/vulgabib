  "Hear my cry, O Deus, attend unto my prayer.",
  "From the ends of the terra, I will cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the petra that is higher than I.",
  "For thou hast been a refuge for me, a tour of strength from the face of the enemy.",
  "I will dwell in thy tabernacula for ever: I will be holden in the covert of thy wings.",
  "For thou, O Deus, hast heard my votum: thou hast given hereditatem to those that fear thy Nomen."
