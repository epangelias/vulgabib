  "What shall we say then that Abraham our pater, as pertaining to the carne, hath found?",
  "For if Abraham were justified by opera, he hath whereof to gloriari; but not before Deus.",
  "For what saith the Scriptura? Abraham credidit Deo, and it was counted unto him for iustitia.",
  "Now to him that worketh, the merces is not reckoned of gratia, but of debitum.",
  "But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that iustificat the impium, his fides is counted for iustitia.",
  "Even as David also describeth the beatitudinem of the homo, unto whom Deus imputeth iustitiam without opera.",
  "Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquitates are remitted, and whose peccata are covered.",
  "Blessed is the homo to whom the Dominus imputeth not peccatum.",
  "Cometh this beatitudinem then upon the circumcision, or upon the praeputium? for we say that fides was reckoned to Abraham for iustitia.",
  "How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in praeputium? Not in circumcision, but in praeputium.",
  "And he received the signum of circumcision, a sigillum of the iustitia of the fides which he had yet being in praeputium: that he might be the pater of all them that believe, though they be in praeputium; that iustitia might be imputed unto them also:",
  "And the pater of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the vestigiis of that fides of our pater Abraham, which he had in praeputium.",
  "For the promissio, that he should be the heres of the mundus, was not to Abraham, or to his semen, through the lex, but through the iustitia of fides.",
  "For if they which are of the lex be heredes, fides is made void, and the promissio of none effect:",
  "Because the lex worketh wrath: for where no lex is, there is no transgressio.",
  "Therefore it is of fides, that it might be by gratia; to the end the promissio might be sure to all the semen; not to that only which is of the lex, but to that also which is of the fides of Abraham; who is the pater of us all,",
  "(As it is written, I have made thee a pater of many gentes,) before him whom he believed, even Deus, who quickeneth the mortuos, and calleth those things which be not as though they were.",
  "Who against hope believed in spem, that he might become the pater of many gentes, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy semen be.",
  "And being not weak in fides, he considered not his own corpus now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sara's uterus:",
  "He staggered not at the promissio of Deus through unbelief; but was strong in fides, giving gloria to Deus;",
  "And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform.",
  "And therefore it was imputed to him for iustitia.",
  "Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him;",
  "But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Iesum our Dominus from the mortuos;",
  "Who was delivered for our peccata, and was raised again for our iustitia."
