  "Thirty-two paths of wisdom hath Yah, the Lord of Hosts, God of Israel, the Living God, El Shaddai, merciful and gracious, God of heaven and earth.",
  "Merely by His intention, He created three Sepharim: Bereshith, Yetzirah, and Temurah.",
  "He created His universe by three sepharim, namely, Sefar, Sippur, and Sapher.",
  "The Sepharim are ten in number, and they are reduced to three heads, namely, Ammah, the Father; Ruach, the Spirit; and Neshamah, the Breath.",
  "These ten Sepharim are one in the unity of God, and they are the foundation of all things.",
  "They are the ten fingers of God, and they are the ten utterances by which God created the universe.",
  "One is the Spirit of the Living God, blessed be He, and in His unity, He is the fountain of all life.",
  "Before Him, there was no other, and after Him, there will be none other.",
  "His kingdom is an eternal kingdom, and His throne is a throne of glory, and He is the Lord of all lords, and the King of all kings."
