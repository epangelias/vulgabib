  "1 The transgression of the wicked saith within my cor, There is no timor Dei before his oculi.",
  "2 For he flattereth himself in his own oculi, till his iniquitas be found to be hateful.",
  "3 The words of his os are iniquitas and dolus: he hath left off to be sapient and to do bonum.",
  "4 He deviseth iniquitas upon his lectus: he setteth himself in via that is not bona: he abhorreth not malum.",
  "5 Thy misericordia, O Domine, is in caelis; thy veritas reacheth unto the nubes.",
  "6 Thy iustitia is like the montes of God: thy iudicia are a great profundum.",
  "7 How precious is thy misericordia, O Deus: therefore the filii of men put their trust under the umbra of thy alas.",
  "8 They shall be abundantly satisfied with the pinguedo of thy domus: and thou shalt make them drink of the rivus of thy voluptas.",
  "9 For with thee is the fons of vita: in lumine tuo we see lumen.",
  "10 O continue thy misericordia unto those that know thee; and thy iustitia unto those that are recti corde.",
  "11 Let not the pes of superbus come against me, and let not the manus of impie seize me.",
  "12 There are the operarii of iniquitas fallen: they are cast down, and shall not be able to surgere.",
  "36 The malum of the wicked shall destroy them: because they refused to do iustitia.",
  "37 Mark the perfecte, and behold the iustus: for the finis of that vir is pacem.",
  "38 But the transgressores shall be destroyed together: the posterior of the wicked shall be cut off.",
  "39 But the salvus of the iusti is a Domino: he is their fortitudo in tempore tribulationis.",
  "40 Et Dominus adiuvabit eos, et salvabit eos: et eripiet eos a malis, quia in eo speraverunt."
