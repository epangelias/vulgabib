                    <p>And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves before Deus.</p>
<p>And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith Dominus Deus of Israel, Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flumen Jordan, Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nachor: and they served other deos.</p>
<p>And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flumen, and led him throughout all the terra Chanaan, and multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac.</p>
<p>And I gave unto Isaac Iacob and Esau: and I gave unto Esau mount Seir, to possess it; but Iacob and his filii went down into Aegyptum.</p>
<p>I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Aegyptum, according to that which I did among them: and afterward I brought you out.</p>
<p>And I brought your fathers out of Aegyptum: and ye came unto the mare, and the Aegyptii pursued after your fathers with chariots and equites, unto the mare.</p>
<p>And when they cried unto Dominus, he put caligo and tenebrae between you and the Aegyptii, and brought the mare upon them, and covered them; and your eyes have seen what I have done in Aegyptum: and ye dwelt in the desert many dies.</p>
<p>And I brought you into the terra of the Amorrhoei, who dwelt on the other side Iordanis; and they fought against you: and I gave them into your manus, that ye might possess their terra; and I destroyed them from before you.</p>
<p>Then Balac the son of Zippor, rex Moab, arose and warred against Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you:</p>
<p>But I would not hearken unto Balaam; therefore he blessed you still: so I delivered you out of his manus.</p>
<p>And ye went over Iordanem, and came unto Iericho: and the men of Iericho fought against you, the Amorrhoei, and the Pherezee, and the Chanaanite, and the Hethaei, and the Hevaei, and the Iebusaei, and I delivered them into your manus.</p>
<p>And I sent the hornet before you, which drave them out from before you, even the two kings of the Amorrhoei; but not with thy gladius, nor with thy arcus.</p>
<p>And I have given you a terra for which ye did not labor, and cities which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of vineyards and oliveta, which ye planted not, do ye eat.</p>
<p>Now therefore fear Dominum, and serve him in integritate and in veritate: and put away the deos which your fathers served on the other side of the flumen, and in Aegyptum; and serve ye Dominum.</p>
<p>And if it seem evil unto you to serve Dominum, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the deos which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flumen, or the deos of the Amorrhoei, in whose terra ye dwell: but as for me and my domus, we will serve Dominum.</p>
<p>And the people answered and said, Deus forbid that we should forsake Dominum, to serve other deos;</p>
<p>Dominus our Deus, he it is that brought us up and our fathers out of the terra of Aegyptum, from the domus of servitutis, and which did those great signa in our sight, and preserved us in all the via which we went, and among all the populi whom we passed through;</p>
<p>And Dominus drave out from before us all the gentes, even the Amorrhoei which dwelt in the terra: therefore will we also serve Dominum; for he is our Deus.</p>
<p>And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve Dominum: for he is sanctus Deus; he is a Deus zelotes: he will not forgive your iniquitates nor your peccata.</p>
<p>If ye forsake Dominum, and serve strange deos, then he will turn and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath done you good.</p>
<p>And the people said unto Joshua, Nay; but we will serve Dominum.</p>
<p>And Joshua said unto the people, Ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you Dominum, to serve him. And they said, We are witnesses.</p>
<p>Now therefore put away, said he, the strange deos which are among you, and incline your cor to Dominum Deo Israel.</p>
<p>And the people said unto Joshua, The Lord our Deus will we serve, and his voice will we obey.</p>
<p>So Joshua made a foedus with the people that day, and set them a lex and a iudicium in Sichem.</p>
<p>And Joshua wrote these verba in the libro legis Dei, and took a great lapidem, and set it up there under the quercus, that was by the sanctuarium of Dominus.</p>
<p>And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this lapidem shall be a testis unto us, for it hath heard all the verba of Dominus which he spake unto us: it shall be therefore a testis unto you, lest ye deny your Deus.</p>
<p>So Joshua let the people depart, every man unto his hereditas.</p>
<p>And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the servus of Dominus, died, being an hundred and ten years old.</p>
<p>And they buried him in the border of his hereditas in Timnathserach, which is in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the montem Gaas.</p>
<p>And Israel served Dominum all the dies of Joshua, and all the dies of the elderum that overlived Joshua, and which had known all the opera of Dominus, that he had done for Israel.</p>
<p>And the bones of Ioseph, which the filii Israel brought up out of Aegyptum, buried they in Sichem, in the parcel of ground which Iacob bought of the filiis of Hamor the father of Sichem for an hundred pieces of argent, and it became the hereditas of the filiis of Ioseph.</p>
<p>And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a hill that pertained to Phinees his son, which was given him in mount Ephraim.</p>
