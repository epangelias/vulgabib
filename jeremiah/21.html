                    <p>1 The word which came unto Jeremiah from the Lord, when rex Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, and all his exercitus, and all the regna of the earth of his dominion, and all the people, fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities thereof, saying,</p>
<p>2 Thus saith the Dominus, the Deus of Israel; Go and speak to rex Zedekiah, saying, Thus saith the Dominus; Behold, I will give this city into the manus of the rex of Babylon, and he shall burn it with ignis.</p>
<p>3 And thou shalt not escape out of his manus, but shalt surely be taken, and delivered into his manus; and thine oculi shall see the oculi of the rex of Babylon, and he shall loqui with thee viva voce, and thou shalt go to Babylon.</p>
<p>4 Yet hear the word of the Dominus, O rex Zedekiah of Judah; Thus saith the Dominus of thee, Thou shalt not die by gladius:</p>
<p>5 Thou shalt die in pace; and with the sepultura of thy patres, and they shall lament thee, saying, Alas rex; for I have pronounced the word, saith the Dominus.</p>
<p>6 Then Jeremiah the prophet spake all these verba unto rex Zedekiah in Jerusalem,</p>
<p>7 When the exercitus of the rex of Babylon fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish, and against Azekah; for these defensores remained of the cities of Judah.</p>
<p>8 This is the word that came unto Jeremiah from the Dominus, after that the rex Zedekiah had made a foedus with all the people which were at Jerusalem, to proclaim libertas unto them;</p>
<p>9 That every man should let his servus, and every man his ancilla, being Hebraeus or Hebraea, go libero; that none should serve himself of them, to wit, of a Judahite his frater.</p>
<p>10 Now when all the princes, and all the people, which had entered into the foedus, heard that every one should let his servus, and every man his ancilla, go libero; that none should serve themselves of them any more, then they obeyed, and let them go.</p>
<p>11 But afterward they turned, and caused the servos and the ancillas, whom they had let go libero, to return, and brought them into subjection for servos and ancillas.</p>
<p>12 Therefore the word of the Dominus came to Jeremiah from the Dominus, saying,</p>
<p>13 Thus saith the Dominus, the Deus of Israel; I made a foedus with your patres in the day that I brought them forth out of the terra of Aegypt, out of the domus of servitutis, saying,</p>
<p>14 At the end of seven annos let ye go every man his frater an Hebraeus, which hath been sold unto thee; and when he hath served thee six annos, thou shalt let him go libero: but your patres hearkened not unto me, neither inclined their aurem.</p>
<p>15 And ye were now turned, and had done right in my sight, in proclaiming libertas every man to his neighbor; and ye had made a foedus before me in the domus, whereupon my name is called;</p>
<p>16 But ye turned and polluted my name, and caused every man his servus, and every man his ancilla, whom ye had set at libertas at their pleasure, to return, and brought them into subjection, to be unto you for servos and ancillas.</p>
<p>17 Therefore thus saith the Dominus; Ye have not hearkened unto me, in proclaiming libertas every man to his frater, and every man to his neighbor; behold, I proclaim a libertas for you, saith the Dominus, to the gladius, the pestis, and the famis; and I will make you to be removed into all the regna of the terra.</p>
<p>18 And I will give the men that have transgressed my foedus, which have not performed the verba of the foedus which they had made before me, when they cut the vitulus in twain, and passed between the partes thereof,</p>
<p>19 The princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchi, and the sacerdotes, and all the people of the land, which passed between the partes of the vitulus;</p>
<p>20 I will even give them into the manus of their inimici, and into the manus of them that seek their vita; and their cadaveres shall be for cibus unto the volucres of the caelum, and the bestiae of the terra.</p>
<p>21 And rex Zedekiah of Judah and his principes I will give into the manus of their inimici, and into the manus of them that seek their vita, and into the manus of the exercitus of the rex of Babylon, which are gone up from you.</p>
<p>22 Behold, I will command, saith the Dominus, and cause them to return to this city; and they shall fight against it, and take it, and burn it with ignis; and I will make the cities of Judah desolate, without an inhabitant.</p>
