                    <p>Stand fast therefore in the libertas wherein Christ hath made you free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of servitudo.</p>
<p>Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcisi, Christ shall profit you nothing.</p>
<p>For I testify again to every man that is circumcisi, that he is a debitor to do the whole lex.</p>
<p>Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are iustificati by lex; ye are fallen from gratia.</p>
<p>For we through the Spirit wait for the spem iustitiae by fides.</p>
<p>For in Christo Iesu neither circumcisi nor uncircumcisi availet any thing, but fides which worketh by amor.</p>
<p>Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the veritas?</p>
<p>This persuasio cometh not of him that calleth you.</p>
<p>A little fermentum fermentat the whole mass.</p>
<p>I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded; but he that troubleth you shall bear his iudicium, whosoever he be.</p>
<p>And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcisi, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the scandal of the crucis ceased.</p>
<p>I would they were even cut off which trouble you.</p>
<p>For, brethren, ye have been called unto libertas; only use not libertas for an occasion to the caro, but by amor serve one another.</p>
<p>For all the lex is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt amare thy proximus as thyself.</p>
<p>But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.</p>
<p>This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the concupiscentias of the caro.</p>
<p>For the caro lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the caro; and these are contrary the one to the other; so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.</p>
<p>But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not sub lege.</p>
<p>Now the works of the caro are manifest, which are these; Adulterium, fornicatio, immunditia, luxuria,</p>
<p>Idolatria, veneficium, inimicitiae, contentio, aemulatio, ira, rixae, dissensiones, sectae,</p>
<p>Invidia, homicidium, ebrietas, comissa, and such like; of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in times past, that they which do such things shall not heredes of the regnum Dei.</p>
<p>But the fructus of the Spirit is caritas, gaudium, pax, patientia, benignitas, bonitas,</p>
<p>Fides,</p>
<p>Mansuetudo, temperantia; against such there is no lex.</p>
<p>And they that are Christi, have crucified the caro with the affectibus and concupiscentiis.</p>
<p>If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.</p>
<p>Let us not be desiderosi of vainam gloriam, provoking one another, envying one another.</p>
<p>Brethren, if a man be overtaken in any delictum, ye which are spirituales, restore such an one in the spirit of mansuetudo; considering thyself, lest thou also be temptatus.</p>
<p>Bear ye one another's onera, and so fulfill the lex Christi.</p>
<p>For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.</p>
<p>But let every man prove his own opus, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.</p>
<p>For every man shall bear his own onus.</p>
<p>Let him that is doctrinam, communicate unto him that doctorem in all bonis.</p>
<p>Be not deceived; Deus non est irrisus.</p>
<p>For whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also metere.</p>
<p>For he that soweth in his caro, of the caro shall reap corruptio; but he that soweth in the Spirit, of the Spirit shall reap vitam aeternam.</p>
<p>And let us not be weary in benefaciendo; for in due tempus we shall reap, if we faint not.</p>
<p>As we have therefore opportunitas, let us do bonum unto all men, especially unto them who are of the domesticum fidei.</p>
<p>Ye see how large a litera I have written unto you with mine own manus.</p>
<p>As many as desire to make a fair shew in the caro, they constrain you to be circumcisi; only lest they should suffer persecution for the crucis of Christ.</p>
<p>For neither they themselves who are circumcisi keep the lex; but desire to have you circumcisi, that they may glory in your caro.</p>
<p>But Deus forbid that I should glory, save in the cruce of our Lord Iesu Christi, whereby the mundus is crucified unto me, and I unto the mundus.</p>
<p>For in Christo Iesu neither circumcisi nor uncircumcisi availet any thing, but a new creatura.</p>
<p>And as many as walk according to this regulam, pax and misericordia be upon them, and upon the Israel Dei.</p>
<p>From henceforth let no man trouble me; for I bear in my corpo the stigmata of our Lord Iesu Christi.</p>
<p>The gratia of our Lord Iesu Christi be with your spirit, fratres. Amen.</p>
