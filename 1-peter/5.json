  "There was an elder who wrote unto the electa lady and her filii, whom I love in caritas, and not I only, but also all they that have cognitio of the veritas;",
  "Because of the veritas which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever.",

  "Grace be with you, mercy, and pax, from Deus Pater, and from Iesus Christus, the Filius of the Pater, in veritas and in caritas;",
  "I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy filii walking in veritas, as we have received a mandatum from the Pater;",
  "And now, dear lady, I beseech thee, not as writing a novum mandatum unto thee, but that which we had from the principio, that we love one another;",
  "And this is love, that we walk after his mandata. This is the mandatum, That, as ye have audited from the principio, ye should walk in it;",

  "If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrina, receive him not into domum, neither salute him;",
  "For he that saluteth him is particeps of his malis operibus.",
  "HAVING many things to write unto you, I would not write with paper and ink;",
  "but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that your gaudeo may be plena.",
  "He that hath the gratia of our Dominus Iesus Christus be with you all. Amen."
