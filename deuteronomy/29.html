                    <p>1. These be the words of the covenant, quod the Lord commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, besides the covenant quod he made with them in Horeb.</p>
<p>2. And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them, Ye have seen all that the Lord did before your eyes in the land of Egypt unto Pharaoh, and unto all his servos, and unto all his land;</p>
<p>3. The great temptations which thine eyes have seen, the signa, and those great miracula:</p>
<p>4. Yet the Lord hath not given you cor, eyes to see, nor aures to hear, unto this day.</p>
<p>5. And I have led you forty annos in the desert: your vestes are not consumed upon you, and your calceus is not waxen old upon thy foot.</p>
<p>6. Ye have not eaten panis, neither have ye drunk vinum or potus, that ye might know that I am the Lord your Deus;</p>
<p>7. Until ye came unto this locus, as ye came against the exercitus of Sehon rex of Heshbon, and against the exercitus of Og rex of Bashan.</p>
<p>8. And we took their terram, and gave it for hereditas unto the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half tribus of Manasseh.</p>
<p>9. Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that ye may prosper in all that ye do.</p>
<p>10. Ye stand this day all of you before the Lord your Deus; your principes of tribes, your elders, and your officers, with all the men of Israel,</p>
<p>11. Your pueri, your uxores, and thy stranger that is in thy castra, from the hewer of thy ligna unto the drawer of thy aqua:</p>
<p>12. That thou shouldest pass into the covenant of the Lord thy Deus, and into his jus, which the Lord thy Deus maketh with thee this day:</p>
<p>13. That he may establish thee to day for his populus, and that he may be unto thee Deus, as he hath said unto thee, and as he hath sworn unto thy patres, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.</p>
<p>14. Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this jus,</p>
<p>15. But with him that standeth here with us this day before the Lord our Deus, and also with him that is not here with us this day:</p>
<p>16. (For ye know how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt; and how we came through the nations which ye passed by;</p>
<p>17. And ye have seen their abomination, and their idols, ligna and lapides, argentum and aurum, which were among them:)</p>
<p>18. Lest there should be among you homo, or mulier, or familia, or tribus, whose cor turneth away this day from the Lord our Deus, to go and serve the dii of these nations;</p>
<p>19. Lest there should be among you a radix, whose fructus may be gall and wormwood;</p>
<p>20. And it come to pass, when he heareth the words of this jus, that he bless himself in his cor, saying, I shall have pax, though I walk in the imagination of mine cor, to add drunkenness to thirst:</p>
<p>21. The Lord will not spare him, but then the indignatio of the Lord and his zelus shall smoke against that homo, and all the maledictions that are written in this liber shall lie upon him, and the Lord shall blot out his nomen from under heaven.</p>
<p>22. And the Lord shall separate him unto malum out of all the tribus of Israel, according to all the maledictions of the covenant that are written in this liber of the Law:</p>
<p>23. So that the generation to come of your filii that shall rise up after you, and the stranger that shall come from a far terra, shall say, when they see the plagues of that terra, and the diseases which the Lord hath laid upon it;</p>
<p>24. And that the whole terra thereof is brimstone, and sal, and burning, that it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any herba groweth therein, like the destruction of Sodom, and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, which the Lord overthrow in his indignatio, and in his furor:</p>
<p>25. Even all the gentes shall say, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the Lord Deus of their patres, which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt:</p>
<p>26. For they went and served other dii, and worshipped them, dii whom they knew not, and whom he had not given unto them:</p>
<p>27. And the indignatio of the Lord was kindled against this terra, to bring upon it all the maledictions that are written in this liber:</p>
<p>28. And the Lord rooted them out of their terra in indignatio, and in ira, and in great furor, and cast them into another terra, as it is this day.</p>
<p>29. The secret things belong unto the Lord our Deus: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our filii for ever, that we may do all the words of this Law.</p>
