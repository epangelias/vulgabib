                    <p>O God, the heathen are come into thine hereditas, they have polluted thy sanctuarium, they have laid Hierusalem in ruinum.</p>
<p>We have heard with our aures, O God, our patres have told us, what thou hast wrought in their dies, in the dies of old.</p>
<p>Thou hast planted manus tua, they have rooted radix profundus, they have filled the facies of the earth with fructus their own.</p>
<p>Thou hast shown thy populus potentiam among the gentes, thou hast redeemed iacob, thou hast planted radix pedis tui.</p>
<p>Thou hast brought a vinea out of Aegyptum, thou hast expelled the gentes and planted eam.</p>
<p>Thou hast prepared the way before eam, and thou hast planted radix eam, and she hath filled the terram.</p>
<p>She hath sent radix sua unto the maris, and her rami unto the flumen.</p>
<p>Why hast thou then broken down the muri eius, so that all they which pass by the via pluck eam?</p>
<p>The porcus ex Aegypto wasteth eam, and the unicornes of the silva thrust through eam with their cornu.</p>
<p>Turn again, O Deus exercituum, look down from caelum, and behold, and visit this vinea;</p>
<p>And the vinea which thy dextera manus hath planted, and upon the filius hominis whom thou hast confirmed for thyself.</p>
<p>It is burnt with ignis, it is cut down, they perish at the rebuke of thy facies.</p>
<p>Let thy manus be upon the homo dexter of thee, upon the filius hominis whom thou hast confirmed for thyself.</p>
<p>So will not we go back from thee, quicken us, and we will invocabimus nomen tuum.</p>
<p>O Deus exercituum, convert us, and show thy facies, and we shall be salvus.</p>
