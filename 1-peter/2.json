  "Wherefore laying aside all malitia, and all guile, and hypocrisim, and envie, and all evil speakings,",
  "As newborn babes, desiderate the sincere lactus of the word, that ye may grow thereby:",
  "If so be ye have tasted that the Dominus is benignus:",
  "To whom coming, as unto a living lapidea, disallowed indeed of men, but elect and precious in the sight of Dei;",
  "Ye also, as viventes lapides, are built up a spiritual domus, an holy sacerdotium, to offer up sacrificia by Iesu Christ;",
  "Wherefore also it is contained in the scriptura, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner petra, elect, precious:",
  "And he that believeth on him shall not be confusus.",
  "But ye are a elect generatio, a regalis sacerdotium, a sancta gens, a peculiar populus;",
  "That ye should shew forth the virtutes of him who hath called you out of tenebrae into his marvellous lumen:",
  "Which in time past were not a populus, yet are now the populus Dei;",
  "Which had not obtained misericordiam, but now have obtained misericordiam.",
  " Dearly beloved, I beseech you as peregrini and strangers, abstain from carnal desideria, which war against the anima;",
  "Having your conversation honest among the gentes:",
  "That whereas they speak against you as malorum, they may by your bonorum opera, which they shall behold, glorify Deum in the die visitationis."
