  "Praise ye the Dominus. For it is good to sing praises unto our Deus; for it is pleasant; and praise is comely.",
  "Deus buildeth up Hierosolyma; he gathereth together the dispersed of Israel.",
  "He healeth the contrite spirit, and bindeth up their wounds.",
  "He telleth the numero of the stellae; he calleth them all by their nomina.",
  "Great is our Dominus, and of great virtus; and his intelligentia is infinite.",
  "Deus lifteth up the humili; he casteth the impious to the ground.",
  "Sing unto Deus a novum canticum; let his laudatio be in the ecclesia of pios.",
  "For Deus preserveth the viros of the righteous, but the viros of the impious shall be cast down.",
  "Let the iusti be joyful in Gloria; let them sing in their cubiculi.",
  "Exaltabo te, O Deus, for thou hast confirmed me; and hast not made my inimici to rejoice over me.",
  "O Deus, thou hast known my animus; thou hast not given me over unto the manus of the inimicus.",
  "Thou hast placed me in loco conveniente; and thy benignitas hath followed me all the dies of my vita.",
  "Quoniam non relinques my animam in Inferno; neither shalt thou suffer thy Sanctus to vide corruption.",
  "Thou hast made known to me the via of vita; thou shalt fill me with letitia before thy faciem; with delectatio at thy dexteram for evermore.",
  "Blessed be Deus, qui non amovit orationem meam; nor his benignitas from me."
