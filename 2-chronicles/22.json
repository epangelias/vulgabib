  "And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead: for the band of men that came with the Arabes had slain all the eldest. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned.",
  "Forty and two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Athaliah the daughter of Omri.",
  "He also walked in the ways of the domus of Ahab: for his mater was his consiliarius to do malum.",
  "Wherefore he did evil in the sight of the Dominus like the domus of Ahab: for they were his consiliarii after the death of his pater to his destructio.",
  "He walked also after their consilium, and went with Joram the filius of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramothgilead: and the Syrians smote Joram.",
  "And he returned to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds which he received in Ramah, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria. And Azariah the filius of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the filius of Ahab at Jezreel, because he was sick.",
  "And the ruina of Ahaziah was from Deus, that he should come to Joram: for when he was come, he went out with Joram against Jehu the filius of Nimshi, whom the Dominus had anointed to cut off the domus of Ahab.",
  "And it came to pass, that, when Jehu was executing judicium upon the domus of Ahab, and found the principes of Judah, and the filii of the fratres of Ahaziah, that ministered to Ahaziah, he slew them.",
  "And he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him, (for he was hid in Samaria,) and they brought him to Jehu: and when they had slain him, they buried him: Because, said they, he is the filius of Jehoshaphat, who sought the Dominus with all his cor.",
  "And the domus of Ahaziah had no potentia to retain still the regnum.",
  "But when Athaliah the mater of Ahaziah saw that her filius was mortuus, she arose and destroyed all the semina of the regnum of the domus of Judah.",
  "But Jehoshabeath, the filia of Jehoram, the soror of Ahaziah, took Joash the filius of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the filii of the king that were slain, and put him and his nutrix in the bedchamber.",
  "So Jehoshabeath, who was the filia of Jehoram, the uxor of Jehoiada the pontifex, (for she was the soror of Ahaziah,) hid him from Athaliah, so that she slew him not.",
  "And he was with them hid in the domus of Deus six years: and Athaliah reigned over the land.",
  "And the septimus year Jehoiada sent and took the centuriones and the milites, and brought them to him into the domus of Deus, and made a foedus with them, and took an oath of them in the domus of Deus, and shewed them the filius of the king.",
  "And he commanded them, saying, This is the thing that ye shall do; A tertius part of you that enter in on the Sabbatum shall be portarii of the custodia of the regalis domus;",
  "And an alia pars shall be at the porta Sur: and a tertius pars at the porta post valvas: and the rest of the populus shall be in the atria of the domus of Deus.",
  "But let none enter into the domus of the Dominus, save the sacerdotes, and they that minister of the Levites; they shall go in, for they are sancti: but all the populus shall keep the vigilantia of the Dominus.",
  "And the Levites shall compass the king round about, every man with his arma in his manus; and whosoever else cometh into the domus, he shall be put to mors.",
  "And the Levites did according to the word of Jehoiada, and the centuriones and the milites, as Jehoiada the pontifex commanded. And they took every man his vir, from the sexta hora in the morning to the noctis hora, at the porta of the domus of the Dominus.",
  "And Jehoiada the pontifex went out, and looked upon the centuriones and upon the milites, and said unto them, Have them go out from the Sanctuarium of the Dominus; and let them put to mors with gladiis every one that followeth them: for the pontifex hath commanded the word.",
  "And they smote Athaliah with gladiis at the porta of the domus of the king, and they brought the king's filius to him, and put the diadema upon him, and gave him the testimonium, and made him king, and Jehoiada and his filii anointed him, and said, Vivat rex.",
  "And when Athaliah heard the noise of the populus running and praising the king, she came to the populus into the domus of the Dominus:",
  "And she looked, and, behold, the king stood at his locus, according to the ius; and the principes and the Buccina at his side; and all the populus of the land rejoiced, and blew with Buccinae, also the cantores with instrumentis musicae in lauding, and such things as were invented to praise.",
  "And Athaliah rent her vestes, and cried, Proditio, Proditio.",
  "But Jehoiada the pontifex commanded the centuriones that had the rule over the host, and said unto them, Have her forth without the ordines of the templum, and slay with gladiis whoso followeth her. For the pontifex had said, Let her not be slain in the Sanctuarium of the Dominus.",
  "And they laid hands on her; and she went by the way by the which the equi came into the domus of the king: and there was she slain.",
  "And Jehoiada made a foedus between the Dominus and the king and the populus, that they should be the Dominus' populus; between the king also and the populus.",
  "And all the populus of the land went into the domus of Baal, and brake it down; his altaria and his simulacra brake they in pieces thoroughly, and slew Mattan the sacerdos of Baal before the altaria. And the pontifex appointed officia over the domus of the Dominus.",
  "And he took the centuriones, and the milites, and the populus of the land, and they brought down the king from the domus of the Dominus, and came by the way of the porta of the milites to the domus of the king. So he sat on the solium of the regnum.",
  "And all the populus of the land rejoiced: and the civitas was in pace, after that they had slain Athaliah with gladiis beside the king.",
  "Seven years old was Joash when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mater's name also was Zibiah of Beersheba."
