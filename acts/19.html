                    <p>And it came to pass, that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain discipuli,</p>
<p>He said unto them, Have ye received the Spiritum Sanctum since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Spiritum Sanctum.</p>
<p>And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptizati? And they said, Unto Ioannes baptisma.</p>
<p>Then said Paul, Ioannes verily baptizavit with the baptisma of paenitentia, saying unto the people, that they should credere on him that should come after him, that is, on Christum Iesum.</p>
<p>When they heard this, they were baptizati in the nomine of the Dominus Iesus.</p>
<p>And when Paul had laid his manus upon them, the Spiritum Sanctum came on them; and they spake with linguis, and prophesied.</p>
<p>And all the homines were about twelve.</p>
<p>And he went into the synagoga, and spake boldly for the space of three menses, disputing and persuading the things concerning the regnum Dei.</p>
<p>But when diversi were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil of the via before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the discipuli, disputing daily in the scola of Tyrannus.</p>
<p>And this continued by the space of two anni; so that all they which dwelt in Asia heard the verbum Domini Iesu, both Iudaei and Graeci.</p>
<p>And God wrought not a few miracula by the manus of Paul:</p>
<p>So that from his corporis were brought unto the infirmi kerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the malae spiritus went out of them.</p>
<p>Then certaini of the vagabundi Iudaei, exorcistae, took upon them to call over them which had malae spiritus the nomine of the Dominus Iesus, saying, We adjuro you by Iesus whom Paul preacheth.</p>
<p>And there were seven filii of one Sceva, a Iudaeus, and prince of the sacerdotes, which did this.</p>
<p>And the malus spiritus answered and said, Iesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye?</p>
<p>And the man in whom the malus spiritus was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that domus naked and wounded.</p>
<p>And this was known to all the Iudaei and Graeci also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the nomine of the Dominus Iesus was magnified.</p>
<p>And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their opera.</p>
<p>Many of them also which used curious artes brought their libri together, and burnt them before all men: and they counted the prices of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of argentum.</p>
<p>So mightily grew the verbum of the Dominus and prevailed.</p>
<p>After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spiritum, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Hierusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Roma.</p>
<p>So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season.</p>
<p>And the same time there arose no small tumultus about the via.</p>
<p>For a certaine man named Demetrius, a argentarius, which made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the artifices;</p>
<p>Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our substantia.</p>
<p>Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they be not dei which are made with manus:</p>
<p>So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but also that the templum of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the mundus worshippeth.</p>
<p>And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.</p>
<p>And the whole civitas was filled with confusion: and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatrum.</p>
<p>And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the discipuli suffered him not.</p>
<p>And certaine of the chiefi of Asia, which were his amici, sent unto him, desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theatrum.</p>
<p>Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the ecclesia was confused; and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together.</p>
<p>And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Iudaei putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the manus, and would have made his apologia unto the people.</p>
<p>But when they knew that he was a Iudaeus, all with one voice about the space of two horas cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.</p>
<p>And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the civitas of the Ephesians is a worshippere of the great goddess Diana, and of the image which fell down from Iuppiter?</p>
<p>Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.</p>
<p>For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither sacrilegi nor blasphemers of your goddess.</p>
<p>Wherefore if Demetrius, and the artifices which are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are proconsules, let them implead one another.</p>
<p>But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful ecclesia.</p>
<p>For we are in danger to be called in question for this day's sedition, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concursus.</p>
<p>And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the ecclesia.</p>
