  "And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken.",
  "For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a filius in his senectus: and to the tempus appointed of God which he had promised him.",
  "And Abraham called the nomen of his filius that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.",
  "And Abraham circumcised his filius Isaac being eight dies old, as God had commanded him.",
  "And Abraham was centum years old, when his filius Isaac was born unto him.",
  "And Sarah said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given suck to pueri? for I have borne him a filius in his senectus.",
  "And the puer grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great festum the same die.",
  "And Sarah saw the filius of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, deridere.",
  "Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this ancilla and her filius: for the filius of this ancilla shall not be heir with my filius, even with Isaac.",
  "And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his filius.",
  "And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the puer, and because of thy servus: in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her vox: for in Isaac shall thy semen be called.",
  "And also of the filius of the ancilla will I make a gens, because he is thy semen.",
  "And Abraham rose up early in the mane, and took bread, and a bottle of aqua, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the puer, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the desert of Beersheba.",
  "And the aqua was spent in the bottle, and she cast the puer under one of the shrubs.",
  "And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the puer die: and she sat down over against him, and lift up her vox, and wept.",
  "And God heard the vox of the puer; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of caelum, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the vox of the puer where he is.",
  "Arise, take up the puer, and hold him in thy manus; for I will make him a great gens.",
  "And God opened her oculi, and she saw a puteus of aqua; and she went, and filled the bottle with aqua, and gave the puer a potum.",
  "And God was with the puer; and he grew, and dwelt in the desert, and became an arcarius.",
  "And he dwelt in the desert of Paran: and his mater took him a uxor out of the terra of Egypt.",
  "And it came to pass at that tempus, that Abimelech and Phichol the prince of his exercitus spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:",
  "Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my semen, nor with my posteritas; but according to the clementia that I have shewed thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the terra wherein thou hast sojourned.",
  "And Abraham said, I will swear.",
  "And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a puteus of aqua, which Abimelech's servi had violently taken away.",
  "And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to die.",
  "And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a foedus.",
  "Thus they made a foedus at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the prince of his exercitus, and they returned into the terra of the Philistines.",
  "And Abraham planted a nemus in Beersheba, and called there on the nomen of the LORD, the eternal Deus.",
  "And Abraham sojourned in the terra of the Philistines many dies."
