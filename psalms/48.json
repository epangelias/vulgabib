  "Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praesidium in the city of our Deus.",
  "Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole terra, is mount Sion, on the sides of the septentriones, the city of the great Rex.",
  "God is known in her palatiums for a refugium.",
  "For, lo, the reges of the earth are gathered together, with the naves of the Tharsis, as if they would conquer it.",
  "They saw it, and so they admirabantur; they were consternati, and hasted away.",
  "Fear took hold upon them there, and pain, as of a woman in partu.",
  "Thou breakest the naves of Tharsis with an east wind.",
  "As we have audied, so have we videre in the city of the Lord of exercituum, in the city of our Deus: Deus will establish it for ever. Selah.",
  "We have pensatum, O Deus, thy misericordia in the midst of thy templum.",
  "According to thy nominis, O Deus, so is thy laus unto the fines of the terra: thy dextera is full of justitia.",
  "Let mount Sion be glad, let the filiae of Judah be joyful, because of thy judicia.",
  "Walk about Sion, and go round about her: tell the towers thereof.",
  "Mark ye well her munition, and consider her palatiums: that ye may tell it to the generation sequens.",
  "For this Deus is our Deus for ever and ever: he will be our ductor even unto death."
