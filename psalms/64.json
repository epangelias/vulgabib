  "Hear my voice, O Deus, in my meditation; preserve my vita from fear of inimicus.",
  "Attend unto me, and hearken unto my vox; I muse in my afflictio, and make a noise.",
  "I cried unto thee, O Deus; yea, unto thee, O Deus, I made my oratio.",
  "My soul shall make her boast in the Domini; the humble shall hear thereof, and be glad.",
  "O Deus, thou wilt hear my oratio; thou wilt give ear to the vox of my supplications.",
  "In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee; for thou wilt answer me, and I shall be saved among inimici.",
  "There is none among the filii hominum that can deliver out of thy manus; thy manus, O Deus, can deliver out of the manus of inimici.",
  "My offerings in voluntas I will pay before thee, O Deus; I will praise thy nomen, for it is bonum.",
  "For thou hast delivered my anima from morte; wilt not thou deliver my pedes from falling, that I may walk before Deum in lumine viventium?"
