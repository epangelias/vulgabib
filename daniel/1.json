  "In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim rex of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar rex of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.",
  "And the Lord gave Jehoiakim rex of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the domus of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the domus of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure domus of his god.",
  "And the rex spake unto Ashpenaz the magister of his eunuchs, that he should bring certain of the children of Israel, and of the rex seed, and of the nobles;",
  "Youths in whom was no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability in them to stand in the rex court, and whom they might teach the learning and the lingua of the Chaldeans.",
  "And the rex appointed them a daily portion of the king's meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the rex.",
  "Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:",
  "Unto whom the magister of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto Daniel the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abednego.",
  "But Daniel purposed in his cor that he would not pollute himself with the portion of the rex meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the magister of the eunuchs that he might not pollute himself.",
  "Now God had brought Daniel into favour and gratia with the magister of the eunuchs.",
  "And the magister of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my dominus the rex, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which are of your sort? then shall ye make me endanger my caput to the rex.",
  "Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the magister of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,",
  "Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.",
  "Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the rex meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.",
  "So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.",
  "And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the rex meat.",
  "Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse.",
  "As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.",
  "Now at the end of the days that the rex had said he should bring them in, then the magister of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.",
  "The rex communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the rex.",
  "And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the rex enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magi and astrologers that were in all his regnum.",
  "And Daniel continued even unto the first year of rex Cyrus."
