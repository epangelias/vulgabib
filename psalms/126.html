                    <p>A Song of degrees. When the LORD turned again the captivitas of Sion, we were like them that dream.</p>
<p>Then was our os filled with risus, and our lingua with canticum: then said they among the Gentiles, The LORD hath done great things for them.</p>
<p>The LORD hath done great things for us; whereof we are laetissimi.</p>
<p>Turn again our captivitas, O LORD, as the torrents in the south.</p>
<p>They that sowed in lacrimis shall reap in gaudeo.</p>
<p>He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious semen, shall doubtless come again with canticum, bringing his manipulos with him.</p>
