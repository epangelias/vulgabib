                    <p>And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of Deus in the earth.</p>
<p>And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the terra, and there fell a noxious and grievous ulcer upon the homines who had the character of the beast, and upon them who worshipped his imago.</p>
<p>And the second angel poured out his vial upon the mare, and it became as the blood of a dead man: and every anima living died in the mare.</p>
<p>And the third angel poured out his vial upon the flumina and the fontes of the aquae; and they became sanguis.</p>
<p>And I heard the angel of the aquae say, Thou art iust, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus.</p>
<p>For they have shed the sanguis of sancti and prophets, and thou hast given them sanguis to drink; for they are worthy.</p>
<p>And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Domine Deus, Omnipotens, vera and iusta are thy iudicia.</p>
<p>And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sol, and it was smitten with a great calor, and the homines were tormented with the calor of the sol.</p>
<p>And the homines blasphemed the nomen of Deus, who hath power over these plaga, and they repented not to give him gloria.</p>
<p>And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the throne of the beast; and his regnum was full of tenebrae; and they gnawed their linguas for dolor.</p>
<p>And blasphemed the Deus of caeli, because of their dolor, and for their ulcer.</p>
<p>And repented not of their opera.</p>
<p>And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great flumen Euphrates; and the aqua thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the Orient might be prepared.</p>
<p>And I saw three unclean spiritus come out of the mouth of the draco, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.</p>
<p>For they are the spiritus of daemonia, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the terra and of the whole orbis, to gather them to the battle of that great die.</p>
<p>Behold, I come as a fur, and my merces shall be as a thief in the nocte.</p>
<p>Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his vestimenta, lest he walk naked, and they see his ignominia.</p>
<p>And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebraic tongue Armageddon.</p>
<p>And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the aether, and there came a great vox out of the templum of caeli, from the throne, saying, It is done.</p>
<p>And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since homines were upon the terra, so mighty an earthquake, and so great.</p>
<p>And the great civitas was divided into three parts, and the civitates of the gentes fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before Deus, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the indignation of his ire.</p>
<p>And every insula fled away, and the montes were not found.</p>
<p>And there fell upon homines a great hail out of caeli, every stone about the weight of a talent: and homines blasphemed Deus because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.</p>
