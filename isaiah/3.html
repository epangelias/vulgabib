                    <p>For, behold, the Lord, the Dominus, of hosts doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water,</p>
<p>The mighty man, and the man of war, the judex, and the prophet, and the prudent artificer, and the ancients,</p>
<p>And I will give children to be their principes, and the effeminate shall dominare over them.</p>
<p>And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbour: the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient, and the base against the honourable.</p>
<p>When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his pater, saying, Thou hast clothing, be thou our prince, and let this ruin be under thy hand:</p>
<p>In that day shall he swear, saying, I will not be an healer; for in my house is neither bread nor clothing: make me not a prince of this people.</p>
<p>For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen: because their lingua and their works are against the Dominus, to provoke the eyes of his gloria.</p>
<p>The shew of their countenance doth witness against them; and they declare their peccata as Sodom, they hide it not. Woe unto their anima! for they have rewarded themselves.</p>
<p>Say ye to the just, that it shall be bene with him: for they shall eat the fructus of their actiones.</p>
<p>Woe unto the wicked! it shall be male with him: for the reward of his manus shall be given him.</p>
<p>As for my people, children are their oppressores, and women dominare over them. O my people, they which lead thee cause thee to err, and destroy the way of thy viae.</p>
<p>The Dominus standeth up to plead, and standeth to judicare the people.</p>
<p>The Dominus will enter into judicium with the ancients of his people, and the principes thereof: for ye have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the pauper is in your houses.</p>
<p>What mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the pauper? saith the Dominus, the Dominus of hosts.</p>
<p>Moreover the Dominus saith, Because the filiae of Sion are haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet:</p>
<p>Therefore the Dominus will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the filiae of Sion, and the Dominus will discover their secret parts.</p>
<p>In that day the Dominus will take away the bravery of their tinkling ornaments about their feet, and their caules, and their round tires like the luna,</p>
<p>The chains, and the sweet balls, and the mufflers, The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands, and the tablets, and the earrings,</p>
<p>The rings, and nose jewels, The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping pins,</p>
<p>The glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the vails.</p>
<p>And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet odour there shall be stench; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well set hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth; and burning instead of beauty.</p>
<p>Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war.</p>
<p>And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she being desolate shall sit upon the terra.</p>
