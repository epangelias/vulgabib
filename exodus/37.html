                    <p>1 And Bezaleel made the ark of shittim wood: the length of it was five cubits, and the breadth of it three cubits, and the height of it three cubits:</p>
<p>2 And he overlaid it with pure gold within and without, and made a moulding of gold to it round about.</p>
<p>3 And he cast for it four rings of gold, to be set by the four corners of it; even two rings upon the one side of it, and two rings upon the other side of it.</p>
<p>4 And he made staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold.</p>
<p>5 And he put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark, to bear the ark.</p>
<p>6 And he made the mercy seat of pure gold: the length of it was five cubits, and the breadth of it three cubits;</p>
<p>7 And he made two cherubim of gold: on the two ends of the mercy seat he made them, as protectoris (protectors) of the mercy seat;</p>
<p>8 One cherub on the end on this side, and another cherub on the other end on that side: out of the mercy seat made he the cherubim on the two ends thereof.</p>
<p>9 And the cherubim spread out their wings on high, covering the mercy seat with their wings, and their facies (faces) were one to another; toward the mercy seat were the facies of the cherubim.</p>
<p>10 And he made the table of shittim wood: the length of it was two cubits, and the breadth of it was a cubit, and the height of it was a cubit and a half:</p>
<p>11 And he overlaid it with pure gold, and made thereunto a crown of gold round about.</p>
<p>12 Also he made thereunto a border of an handbreadth round about; and made a crown of gold for the border thereof round about.</p>
<p>13 And he cast for it four rings of gold, and put the rings upon the four corners that were on the four feet thereof.</p>
<p>14 Over against the border were the rings, the places for the staves to bear the table.</p>
<p>15 And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold, to bear the table.</p>
<p>16 And he made the vessels which were upon the table, his calicis (cups), and his phialae (spoons), and his lagena (flagons), and his urcei (bowls), to cover withal of gold.</p>
<p>17 And he made the candelabrum of pure gold: of aurum ductile (beaten gold) made he the candelabrum; his pedes (base), and his truncus (shaft), his calathorum (bowls), his sphaerulae (knops), and his flosculi (flowers), were of the same:</p>
<p>18 And six branches going out of the sides thereof; three branches of the candelabrum out of the one side thereof, and three branches of the candelabrum out of the other side thereof:</p>
<p>19 Three calathorum in the manner of amygdalae (almonds) in one branch, a sphaerula and a flosculus: and three calathorum in the manner of amygdalae in another branch, a sphaerula and a flosculus: so throughout the six branches going out of the candelabrum.</p>
<p>20 And in the candelabrum were four calathorum fashioned like amygdalae, with their sphaerulae and flosculi.</p>
<p>21 And a sphaerula under two branches of it, and again a sphaerula under two branches of it, and again a sphaerula under two branches of it, according to the six branches going out of it.</p>
<p>22 Their sphaerulae and their branches were of the same, all of it was one beaten work of aurum purum (pure gold).</p>
<p>23 And he made his lucernae (lamps) of gold, seven; and his lucernae (lamps), and his ignifera (snuffers), and his scutellae (spoons) of gold.</p>
<p>24 Of a talent of gold he made it, with all the vessels thereof.</p>
<p>25 And he made the altar of incense of lignum setim (setim wood), a cubit was the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof; foursquare; and two cubits was the height thereof; the horns thereof were of the same.</p>
<p>26 And he overlaid it with aurum purum (pure gold), both the top of it, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns of it; also he made unto it a crown of gold round about.</p>
<p>27 And he made two rings of gold for it under the crown thereof, by the two corners of it, upon the two sides thereof, to be places for the staves to bear it withal.</p>
<p>28 And he made the staves of lignum setim (setim wood), and overlaid them with gold.</p>
<p>29 And he made the oleum sanctum (holy oil), and the incensum (incense) pure and sweet, after the arte (art) of the perfumator (perfumer).</p>
