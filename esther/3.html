                    <p>After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his sede above all the principes who were with him.</p>
<p>And all the servientes of the king, that were in the porta of the king, bowed, and reverenced Haman: for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mardochaeus did not bow, nor did he revere him.</p>
<p>Wherefore the servientes of the king, who were in the porta of the king, said unto Mardochaeus, Why transgress thou the king's commandment?</p>
<p>Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mardochaeus' words would stand: for he had told them that he was a Iudaeus.</p>
<p>And when Haman saw that Mardochaeus bowed not, nor did revere him, then was Haman full of ira.</p>
<p>And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mardochaeus alone; for they had shewed him the people of Mardochaeus: wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Iudaeos that were throughout the whole regnum of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mardochaeus.</p>
<p>In the first mensis, that is, the mensis Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from mensis to mensis, to the twelfth mensis, that is, the mensis Adar.</p>
<p>And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the populi in all the provinciae of thy regnum; and their leges are diverse from all people; neither keep they the king's leges: therefore it is not for the king's profit to suffer them.</p>
<p>If it please the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of auri into the hands of those that have the care of the king's negotium, to bring it into the king's thesauri.</p>
<p>And the king took his annulus from his manus, and gave it unto Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the adversary of the Iudaeos.</p>
<p>And the king said unto Haman, The auri is given to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee.</p>
<p>Then were the king's scriptores called on the thirteenth day of the first mensis, and there was written according to all that Haman had commanded unto the king's satrapae, and to the governors that were over every provincia, and to the rulers of every people of every provincia according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their lingua; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and sealed with the king's annulus.</p>
<p>And the letters were sent by posts into all the king's provinciae, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Iudaeos, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth mensis, which is the mensis Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a prey.</p>
<p>The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every provincia was published unto all people, that they should be ready against that day.</p>
<p>The posts went out, being hastened by the king's commandment, and the decree was given in Shushan the palatium. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city Shushan was perplexed.</p>
