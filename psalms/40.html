                    <p>I waited patiently for the Domini: and he inclined unto me, and heard my clamor.</p>
<p>He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my pedes upon a petra, and established my gressus.</p>
<p>And he hath put a novum canticum in my os, even laudem Dei. Many shall see it, and fear, and shall put their trust in the Dominus.</p>
<p>Blessed is that man that maketh the Dominum his trust, and respecteth not the superbos, nor such as turn aside unto mendacia.</p>
<p>Many, O Dominus my Deus, are thy mirabilia which thou hast done, and thy cogitationes which are to us-ward: they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee: if I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be numerus.</p>
<p>Sacrificium and oblation thou didst not desiderare; mine aures hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required.</p>
<p>Then said I, Ecce, I come: in the volumine of the libro it is written of me,</p>
<p>I delitescere in the voluntas of the Domini, O Deus meus: yea, thy lex is within my cor.</p>
<p>I have preached justitiam in the great congregation: lo, I have not refrained my labia, O Dominus, thou knowest.</p>
<p>I have not hid thy justitiam within my cor: I have declared thy fidelitas and thy salvus: I have not concealed thy misericordia and thy veritas from the great congregation.</p>
<p>Withhold not thou thy misericordias from me, O Dominus: for thy iustitia and thy veritas to ever preserve me.</p>
<p>For innumerable malitiae have compassed me about: mine iniquitates have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the capilli of mine caput: therefore my cor faileth me.</p>
<p>Be pleased, O Dominus, to deliver me: O Dominus, make haste to help me.</p>
<p>Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my animam to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to confusion that desire my hurt.</p>
<p>Let them be desolati for a reward of their turpitudo: who say unto me, Aha, aha.</p>
<p>Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let such as love thy salvus say continually, The Dominus be magnified.</p>
<p>But I am pauper and needy; yet the Dominus careth for me: thou art my adjutor and my liberator; make no tarrying, O Deus meus.</p>
