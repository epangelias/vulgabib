                    <p>And the king shall do according to his voluntas, and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every deus, and shall speak magnalia against the Deus of deos, and shall prosper till the indignatio be accomplished: for that that is determinatum shall be done.</p>
<p>Neither shall he regard the Deus of his patres, nor the desiderium of mulieres, nor regard any deus: for he shall magnify himself above all.</p>
<p>But in his loco shall he honour the deus of munitiones, and a deus whom his patres knew not shall he honour with auro, and argento, and lapidibus pretiosis, and with omni desiderabile.</p>
<p>Thus shall he do in the fortitudine of his facies, corrupting by craft, and prospering in his astutia, and in his cordis he shall destroy many, and shall rise up against the principes, and shall destroy them that are given to him till the consummatio of the tempus.</p>
<p>And the king of the south shall be moved with ira, and shall come forth and fight against him, with his carris, and with his equites, and with a great navis, and he shall enter into the terra, and shall overflow and pass through.</p>
<p>He shall enter also into the gloriosum terra, and many shall be overthrown: but these shall escape out of his manus, even Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the filii of Ammon.</p>
<p>And he shall stretch forth his manus upon the terras, and the terra of Aegyptus shall not escape.</p>
<p>But he shall have potestas over the thesauri of auro, and of argentum, and over all the pretiosi of Aegyptus, and the Libyes, and the Aethiopes shall be at his gressus.</p>
<p>But tidings out of the orient, and out of the septentriones shall trouble him: therefore he shall go forth with great furor to destroy, and utterly to make away many.</p>
<p>And he shall plant the tabernaculum of his in Apadno between the mari, glorious and sanctus: yet he shall come to his finis, and none shall help him.</p>
<p>And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince who standeth for the filii of thy populus: and there shall be a tempus of angustia, such as never was since there was a gens in the terra even to that tempus: and at that tempus thy populus shall be saved, every one that shall be found written in the libro.</p>
<p>And many of them that sleep in the pulvis of the terra shall awake, some to vitam aeternam, and some to contumeliam and to ignominiam sempiternam.</p>
<p>And they that be sapientes shall shine as the luminaria in the firmamento, and they that turn many to justitia as the stellae for ever and ever.</p>
<p>But thou, O Daniel, clausula the sermones, and signa the libro, even to the tempus of the finis: many shall run to and fro, and scientia shall be increased.</p>
<p>And from the tempus that the quotidiana sacrificium shall be taken away, and the abominatio of desolation set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety dies.</p>
<p>Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty dies.</p>
<p>But go thou thy way till the finis be: for thou shalt rest, and stand in thy lot at the finis of the dies.</p>
