  "And he said, Domine, ut videam: that I may receive my sight.",
  "And Iesus said unto him, Recede, vide: thy faith hath saved thee.",
  "And immediately he received visum, sight, and followed him, glorificans Deum: and all the people, when they saw it, gave laudem Deo.",
  "And Iesus entered and passed through Iericho;",
  "And, behold, there was a vir, man, named Zacchaeus, which was the princeps of the publicani, and he was dives, rich.",
  "And he sought to see Iesum, qui esset: who he was;",
  "And could not for the turba, multitude, because he was parvus, stature.",
  "And he ran before, and ascendit, climbed up into a sycomorus, tree to see him: for he was to pass that way.",

  "And Iesus said unto him, Hodie salus huic domui facta est: this day is salvation come to this house;",
  "Forsomuch as he also is Filius Abrahae.",
  "For the Filius hominis came to quaerere, and salvare that which was perditum, lost.",
  "And as they heard these things, he added also a parabolam, parable, because he was prope, near to Ierusalem, and because they thought that the regnum Dei should forthwith apparebit, appear;",
  "He said therefore, Homo quidam nobilis, A certain nobleman went into a provinciam, far country to receive for himself a regnum, and to return.",
  "And he called his servos, servants, and delivered them argentum, money, and said unto them, Negotiamini, Occupy till I come.",
  "And his civitas, citizens hated him, and sent a legatio, legation after him, saying, Nolumus illum regnare, We will not have this man to reign over us.",
  "And it came to pass, that when he was reverturus, returned, having received the regnum, he commanded his servos, whom he had given the argentum, to be called unto him, that he might scire, know how much every man had negociatus, gained.",
  "And the primus, first came, saying, Domine, thy pondus, pound hath lucratus, gained decem alia, ten pounds.",

  "And another came, saying, Domine, behold, thy pondus, which I have servatus, kept in sudario, a napkin:",
  "For I feared thee, quia es homo austerus, for thou art an austere man: thou takest up what thou layedst not down, and reapest what thou didst not seminare, sow.",
  "And he saith unto him, De proprio ore te iudico, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, thou servo prudens, thou wicked servant.",
  "Thou knewest that I am homo austerus, an austere man, taking up what I laid not down, and reaping that which I did not seminare, sow;",
  "Then wherefore gavisti non argentum meum in mensam, didst not thou put my money into the bank, that at my venire, coming I might have exacted it cum usura, with usury?",
  "And he said unto them that stood by, Tollite ab illo pondus, Take from him the pound, and give it to him that hath decem alia, the ten pounds.",
  "For I say unto you, That unto every one which hath, dabitur, shall be given: and from him that hath not, shall be taken away, et quod habet, even that which he hath.",
  "But those mine enemies, which would not that I should regnare, reign over them, adducite illi hic, bring them hither, and interficite, slay them before me.",
  "And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascendens in Ierusalem.",
  "And it came to pass, when he was prope, near to Bethphage and Bethania, at the mons Oliveti, mount of Olives, he sent two of his discipuli, disciples,"
