  "And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his uxor, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south.",
  "And Abram was very rich in pecunia, in argentum, and in aurum.",
  "And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto the locus where his tabernacle had been at the first, between Bethel and Hai;",
  "Unto the locus of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there Abram called on the nomen of the Lord.",
  "And Lot also, which went with Abram, had pecus, and armentum, and tabernacles.",
  "And the terra was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substantia was great, so that they could not dwell together.",
  "And there was a contentio between the pastores of Abram's pecus and the pastores of Lot's pecus: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the terra.",
  "And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no contentio, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my pastores and thy pastores; for we be fratres.",
  "Is not the whole terra before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.",
  "And Lot lifted up his oculi, and beheld all the campus of Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the hortus of the Lord, like the terra of Aegyptus, as thou comest unto Zoar.",
  "Then Lot chose him all the campus of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.",
  "Abram dwelled in the terra of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the campus, and pitched his tabernacle toward Sodom.",
  "But the homines of Sodom were malus and peccatores before the Lord exceedingly.",
  "And the Lord said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine oculi, and look from the locus where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward:",
  "For all the terra which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy semen for ever.",
  "And I will make thy semen as the pulvis of the terra: so that if a man can numerare the pulvis of the terra, then shall thy semen also be numerated.",
  "Arise, walk through the terra in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.",
  "Then Abram removed his tabernacle, and came and dwelt in the valles of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the Lord."
