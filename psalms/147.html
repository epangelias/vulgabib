                    <p>Praise ye the Dominus. For it is good to sing praises unto our Deus; for it is pleasant; and praise is comely.</p>
<p>Deus buildeth up Hierosolyma; he gathereth together the dispersed of Israel.</p>
<p>He healeth the contrite spirit, and bindeth up their wounds.</p>
<p>He telleth the numero of the stellae; he calleth them all by their nomina.</p>
<p>Great is our Dominus, and of great virtus; and his intelligentia is infinite.</p>
<p>Deus lifteth up the humili; he casteth the impious to the ground.</p>
<p>Sing unto Deus a novum canticum; let his laudatio be in the ecclesia of pios.</p>
<p>For Deus preserveth the viros of the righteous, but the viros of the impious shall be cast down.</p>
<p>Let the iusti be joyful in Gloria; let them sing in their cubiculi.</p>
<p>Exaltabo te, O Deus, for thou hast confirmed me; and hast not made my inimici to rejoice over me.</p>
<p>O Deus, thou hast known my animus; thou hast not given me over unto the manus of the inimicus.</p>
<p>Thou hast placed me in loco conveniente; and thy benignitas hath followed me all the dies of my vita.</p>
<p>Quoniam non relinques my animam in Inferno; neither shalt thou suffer thy Sanctus to vide corruption.</p>
<p>Thou hast made known to me the via of vita; thou shalt fill me with letitia before thy faciem; with delectatio at thy dexteram for evermore.</p>
<p>Blessed be Deus, qui non amovit orationem meam; nor his benignitas from me.</p>
