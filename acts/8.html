                    <p>And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the ecclesia which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostoli.</p>
<p>As for Saul, he made havock of the ecclesia, entering into every domus, and haling men and women committed them to prison.</p>
<p>Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where praedicare the word.</p>
<p>Then Philip went down to the civitas of Samaria, and praedicared Christum unto them.</p>
<p>And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the signa which he did.</p>
<p>For unclean spiriti, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed with them: and many taken with paralysis, and that were lame, were healed.</p>
<p>And there was great gaudium in that civitas.</p>
<p>But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same civitas used magia, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:</p>
<p>To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great virtus of God.</p>
<p>And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with magia.</p>
<p>But when they believed Philip praedicans the things concerning the regnum of God, and the nomine of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.</p>
<p>Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the signa and great virtutes which were done.</p>
<p>Now when the apostoli which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the verbum Dei, they sent unto them Petrus and Johannes:</p>
<p>Who, when they were come down, praedixerunt them the Spiritum Sanctum.</p>
<p>For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the nomine of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>Then laid they their manus upon them, and they received the Spiritum Sanctum.</p>
<p>And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostolorum manus the Spiritus Sanctus was given, he offered them pecuniam,</p>
<p>Saying, Give me also this potestas, that on whomsoever I lay manus, he may receive the Spiritum Sanctum.</p>
<p>But Petrus said unto him, Thy pecuniam perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the donum of God may be purchased with pecuniam.</p>
<p>Thou hast neither pars nor lot in this matter: for thy cor is not rectus in the conspectu Dei.</p>
<p>Repent therefore of this thy nefaria, and pray God, if perhaps the cogitatio of thy cor may be forgiven thee.</p>
<p>For I perceive that thou art in galla amaritudinis, and in vinculum iniquitatis.</p>
<p>Then answered Simon, and said, Precamini vos pro me to God, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.</p>
<p>And they, when they had testificari and praedicare the verbum of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and praedicared the evangelium in many castella of the Samaritanorum.</p>
<p>And the angelus Domini spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the meridian, and go along the via that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desertum.</p>
<p>And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuchus of great authority under Candace regina of the Ethiopians, who had the cura of all her thesaurus, and had come to Jerusalem to adore.</p>
<p>And he was returning, and sitting in his currus, he was reading the prophetam Esaiam.</p>
<p>And the Spiritus said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this currus.</p>
<p>And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophetam Esaiam, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?</p>
<p>And he said, How can I, except some man guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.</p>
<p>The place of the Scriptura which he read was this, He was led as a ovicula to the mactatio, and as a agnus before a tonsor, so opened he not his os: In his humiliation his judicium was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his vita is taken from the terra.</p>
<p>And the eunuchus answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophetas this? of himself, or of some other man?</p>
<p>Then Philip opened his os, and began at the same Scriptura, and praedicared unto him Jesus.</p>
<p>And as they went on their via, they came unto a certain aqua: and the eunuchus said, See, here is aqua; what doth hinder me to be baptized?</p>
<p>And Philip said, If thou credis with all thy cor, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I credo that Jesus Christus is the Filius Dei.</p>
<p>And he commanded the currus to stand still: and they went down both into the aqua, both Philip and the eunuchus; and he baptized him.</p>
<p>And when they were come up out of the aqua, the Spiritus Domini caught away Philip, that the eunuchus saw him no more: and he went on his via rejoicing.</p>
<p>But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he praedicared in all the civitates, till he came to Caesarea.</p>
