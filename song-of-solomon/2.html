                    <p>My dilectus is mine, and I am his: he feedeth among the lilia.</p>
<p>As the malus is sweet to my palate, so is my dilectus sweet to me.</p>
<p>He bringeth me to the domus of vinum, and his signum over me is amor.</p>
<p>Sustentent me with floribus, and comfort me with malis: for I am languid with amor.</p>
<p>His left manus is under my caput, and his dextera shall embrace me.</p>
<p>I charge you, O filiae Ierusalem, by the capri, and by the cervi of the campi, that ye stir not up, nor awake my dilectus, till he please.</p>
<p>The vox of my dilectus! behold, he cometh leaping upon the montes, skipping upon the colles.</p>
<p>My dilectus is like a cervus, or a young caper: behold, he standeth behind our paries, looking forth at the fenestrae, shewing himself through the cancelli.</p>
<p>My dilectus spake, and said unto me, Surge, my dilecta, my pulchra, and come away.</p>
<p>For, behold, the hiems is past, the pluvia is over and gone; The flos appear on the terra, and the tempus of the pruning of the vites is come, and the vox of the turdus is heard in our terra.</p>
<p>The flos of the sycomorus appear, and the vites flourish: Arise, my dilecta, my pulchra, and come away.</p>
<p>O my columba, that art in the abscissis of the petra, in the secretis of the scala, shew me thy facies, let me hear thy vox; for thy vox is dulcis, and thy facies is decora.</p>
<p>Take us the vulpes, the little vulpes, that spoil the vineyards; for our vineyard hath flos.</p>
<p>My dilectus is mine, and I am his: he feedeth among the lilia.</p>
<p>Till the dies be cool, and the umbra flee away, turn, my dilectus, and be thou like a cervus, or a young caper upon the montes of Bether.</p>
