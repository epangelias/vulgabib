  "My spirit is broken, my days are extinct, the graves are ready for me.",
  "How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart daily?",
  "Shall I have dominion over my own veritas, and shall I be saved from the hand of the inimicus?",
  "My friends scorn me: but mine oculus is upon Thee, O Deus.",
  "I call to the testificator, and I bring my manus to the iudicium.",
  "My skin is black upon me, and my ossa are burned with febris.",
  "My lyra also is turned to luctus, and my organum to the voice of those qui plorant.",
  "And ut I said, My spirit is broken, my dies are extinct, the sepulchra are ready for me.",
  "These novi homines are those with whom I have been in amicitia, who now perspicaciously propter tenebras deride me.",
  "The manus of Deus hath dealt this, and He hath delivered me to the inimicus.",
  "When His manus touched me, I felt horrorem, and for the timor of Him, I did rise, and I did stand.",
  "He hath destroyed me on every latus, and I am gone, and hath taken away my spes, as a destructor of a arbor.",
  "And this is one thing, in quo I have fiducia, that I shall behold His facies in iudicium.",
  "Oculus non videbit eum, sed Tu, o Deus, videbis eum, propter hanc spem meam, quae est apud Te.",
  "For I know, that my iustificatio is in caelis, and that my Testificator is in caelis.",
  "My friends deride me, but mine oculus is upon Thee, O Deus, qui es meus iudex.",
  "Oculus non videbit eum, sed Tu, o Deus, videbis eum, propter hanc spem meam, quae est apud Te.",
  "Put not fiducia in inimicos, neque speres in filios hominum, in quibus non est salus."
