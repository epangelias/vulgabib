                    <p>And Jethro, the sacerdos of Midian, Moses' socius, heard of all that Deus had done for Moses, and for Israel his populus, whom Deus had led out of Aegyptum.</p>
<p>And Jethro, Moses' socius, took Zipporah, Moses' uxor, after he had sent her back,</p>
<p>And her duos filii; of which the nomen of the unus was Gershom; for he said, I have been a peregrinus in terra aliena:</p>
<p>And the nomen of the alter was Eliezer; for the Deus of my patres, said he, was in auxilium me, and delivered me from the gladius of Pharaonis:</p>
<p>And Jethro, Moses' socius, came with his filii and his uxor unto Moses into the desert, where he encamped at the montem Dei:</p>
<p>And he sent word unto Moses, saying, Ego, thy socius Jethro, venio to thee, with thy uxor, and her duos filii with her.</p>
<p>And Moses went out to meet his socius, and adoravit him, and kissed him; and they asked each other of their salus; and they came into the tabernaculum.</p>
<p>And Moses told his socius all that Deus had done unto Pharaon and to the Aegyptii for Israel's causa, and all the labor that had found them in via, and how Deus delivered them.</p>
<p>And Jethro gavisus est for all the bonum that Deus had done unto Israel, whom he had delivered out of the manus of the Aegyptii.</p>
<p>And Jethro said, Benedictus Deus, who hath delivered you out of the manus of the Aegyptii, and out of the manus of Pharaonis, who hath delivered the populum out of the manus of the Aegyptii.</p>
<p>Nunc scio quod Deus maior est omnibus diis; for in the thing wherein they dealt prouditer against them, he was above them.</p>
<p>And Jethro, Moses' socius, took holocausta and hostias for Deus: and Aaron came, and all the seniores of Israel, to eat panem with Moses' socius before Deus.</p>
<p>And it came to pass on the die altera, that Moses sat to judicare the populum: and the populus stood by Moses from mane unto vesper.</p>
<p>And when Moses' socius saw all that he did to the populum, he said, Quid est hoc that thou doest to the populum? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the populus standeth by thee from mane unto vesper?</p>
<p>And Moses said unto his socius, Because the populus cometh unto me to inquire Deus:</p>
<p>When they have a quaestio, they come unto me; and I judico between a vir and his proximus, and I do make them know the statuta of Deus, and his leges.</p>
<p>And Moses' socius said unto him, Non est bonum hoc that thou doest.</p>
<p>Thou and this populus that is with thee shall be consumed with labor; for this thing is too graviter for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone.</p>
<p>Hearken now unto my vox, and I will give thee consilium, and Deus shall be with thee: Be thou for the populus to Deus-ward, that thou mayest bring the causas unto Deus:</p>
<p>And thou shalt teach them statuta and leges, and shalt show them the via wherein they must ambulare, and the work that they must do.</p>
<p>Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the populus able viri, timentes Deum, viros veraces, who hate avaritiam; and place them over them, to be principes over thousands, and principes over hundreds, and principes over fifties, and principes over tens:</p>
<p>And let them judicare the populum at all times: and it shall be, that every magna causa they shall bring unto thee, but every parva causa they shall judicare: so shall it be easier for thee, and they shall bear the pondus with thee.</p>
<p>If thou shalt do this thing, and Deus command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this populus shall also go in pace unto their loca.</p>
<p>And Moses hearkened to the vox of his socius, and did all that he had said:</p>
<p>And Moses chose able viri out of all Israel, and made them principes over the populus, principes over thousands, principes over hundreds, principes over fifties, and principes over tens.</p>
<p>And they judicabant the populum at all times: the hard causas they brought unto Moses, but every parva causa they judicabant themselves.</p>
<p>And Moses let his socius depart, and he went his via into his terra.</p>
