  "And Ahab had seventy filii in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, unto the principes of Jezreel, to the seniors of Jezreel, saying,",
  "Now as soon as this littera is come unto you, seeing your dominus' filii are with you, and there are with you chariots and equi, a fortified urbs also, and armor;",
  "Look even out the optimus and worthiest of your dominus' filii, and set him on his pater's thronus, and fight for your domus.",
  "But they were exceedingly timidi, and said, Behold, two reges stood not before him: how then shall we stand?",
  "And he that was over the domus, and he that was over the urbs, the seniors also, and the nutricii, sent to Jehu, saying, We are servi: whatsoever thou shalt say unto us, we will do; we will not make any rex: do thou that which is bonus in thine oculi.",
  "Then he wrote a littera the secunda time to them, saying, If ye be mine, and if ye will hearken unto my vox, take ye the caput of the viri filiorum of your dominus', and come to me to Jezreel by cras hodie. And the filii of the rex were seventy viri, and the principes of the urbs had nourished them.",
  "And it came to pass, when the littera came to them, that they took the filii of the rex, and slew seventy viri, and put their caput in cofani, and sent him to Jezreel.",
  "And there came a nuntius to him, saying, They have brought the caput of the filii of the rex. And he said, Lay ye them in two acervi before the porta of the urbs until mane.",
  "And it came to pass in the mane, that he went out, and stood, and said to all the populus, Ye be justi: behold, I conspired against my rex, and slew him, but who laid hands on all these?",
  "Know now that there shall fall unto the terra of the verbum of the Domini, which the Domini spake against the domus of Ahab: and the Domini hath done that which he spake by the manus of his servus Elijah.",
  "Thus Jehu slew all that remained of the domus of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his magni, and his cognati, and his sacerdotes, until he left him none remaining.",
  "And he arose and departed, and came to Samaria. And as he was at the domus of the pastores in the via,",
  "Jehonadab filius Rechab came to meet him, and saluted him, and said to him, Is thine cor rectus, as my cor is with thy cor? And Jehu said, It is. If it be, give me thy manus. And he gave him his manus; and he took him up to him into the currus.",
  "And he said, Come with me, and see my zelo for the Domini. So they made him ride in his currus.",
  "And when he came to Samaria, he slew all that remained unto Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed him, according to the verbum of the Domini, which he spake to Elijah.",
  "And Jehu gathered all the populus together, and said unto them, Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu shall serve him much.",
  "Now therefore call unto me all the propheti of Baal, all his servientes, and all his sacerdotes; let none be wanting: for I have a great sacrificium to do to Baal; whosoever shall be wanting, he shall not live. But Jehu did it in astutia, that he might destroy the servientes of Baal.",
  "And Jehu said, Proclaim a sacrificium solenne to Baal. And they proclaimed it.",
  "And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the servientes of Baal came, so that there was not a vir left that came not. And they came into the templum of Baal; and the templum of Baal was full from one extremity to another.",
  "And he said unto him that was over the vestiarium, Bring forth vestes for all the servientes of Baal. And he brought them forth vestes.",
  "And Jehu went, and Jehonadab filius Rechab, into the templum of Baal, and said unto the servientes of Baal, Search, and look that there be here with you none of the servientes of the Domini, but the servientes of Baal only.",
  "And when they went in to offer sacrificia and holocausta, Jehu appointed fourscore homines without, and said, If any of the viri whom I have brought into your manus escape, he that letteth him go, his anima shall be for the anima of him.",
  "And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering the holocaustum, that Jehu said to the custodes and to the centuriones, Go in, and slay them; let none come forth. And they smote them with the orbus of the gladius, and cast them out, and went unto the urbs of the templum of Baal.",
  "And they brought forth the statuas out of the templum of Baal, and burned them.",
  "And they brake down the statua of Baal, and brake down the templum of Baal, and made it a latrina unto this dies.",
  "Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.",
  "Howbeit from the peccata of Jeroboam filius Nebat, who made Israel to peccare, Jehu departed not from after them, to wit, the golden vituli that were in Bethel, and that were in Dan.",
  "And the Domini said unto Jehu, Because thou hast done well in executing that which is rectus in mine oculi, and hast done unto the domus of Ahab according to all that was in mine cor, thy filii of the quarto generation shall sit on the thronus of Israel.",
  "But Jehu took no heed to walk in the legem of the Domini Deum of Israel with all his cor: for he departed not from the peccata of Jeroboam, who made Israel to peccare.",
  "In those dies the Domini began to cut off partes from Israel: and Hazael smote them in all the fines of Israel;",
  "From Jordan eastward, all the terra of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the riuus Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan.",
  "Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his potentia, are they not written in the libro of the annals of the reges of Israel?",
  "And Jehu slept with his patres: and they buried him in Samaria. And Jehoahaz filius Jehu reigned in his loco.",
  "And the dies of Jehu were twenty and eight anni, and he slept with his patres; and Jehoahaz filius Jehu reigned in his loco."
