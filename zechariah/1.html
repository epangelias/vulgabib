                    <p>In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the Lord unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying: Deus, id est, God, was sore displeased with the progenitores, that is, fathers, and ye have not displeased with the filii, that is, sons.</p>
<p>Therefore say thou unto them, Haec dicit Dominus, that is, Thus saith the Lord; Turn ye unto me, saith the Lord of Hosts, and I will turn unto you, saith the Lord of Hosts.</p>
<p>Be ye not as your patres, that is, fathers, unto whom the prophetae, that is, prophets, formerly cried, saying: Haec dicit Dominus of Hosts, Turn ye now from your viae malae, that is, evil ways, and from your cogitationes malae, that is, evil thoughts: but they did not hear, nor hearken unto me, saith the Lord.</p>
<p>Your patres, quidem, that is, fathers, where are they? and the prophetae, do they live for ever?</p>
<p>But my verba, that is, words, and my statuta, that is, statutes, which I commanded by my ministri, that is, ministers the prophetae, did they not take hold of your patres, that is, fathers? and they returned, and said, As the Lord of Hosts thought to do unto us, according to our viae, that is, ways, and according to our cogitationes malae, that is, evil thoughts, so hath he dealt with us.</p>
<p>Upon the four and twentieth day of the undecimus, that is, eleventh month, which is called Sebat, in the secundus, that is, second year of Darius, came the word of the Lord unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying:</p>
<p>I saw by night, and behold a vir, that is, man riding upon a rufus, that is, red horse, and he stood among the myrtus, that is, myrtle trees that were in the valley, and behind him were equi rufi, that is, red horses, and albi, that is, white, and nigri, that is, black.</p>
<p>And I said, O my Lord, what are these? And the angel that talked with me said unto me, I will shew thee what these be.</p>
<p>And the angel that stood among the myrtus, that is, myrtle trees answered and said, These are they whom the Lord hath sent to walk to and fro through the terra, that is, earth.</p>
<p>And they answered the angel of the Lord that stood among the myrtus, that is, myrtle trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the terra, that is, earth, and behold, all the terra, that is, earth sitteth still, and is quies, that is, quiet.</p>
<p>Then the angel of the Lord answered and said, O Lord of Hosts, how long wilt thou not have misericordiam, that is, mercy on Jerusalem and on the civitates, that is, cities of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these septuaginta, that is, seventy years?</p>
<p>And the Lord answered the angel that talked with me with good verba, that is, words and consolatory.</p>
<p>So the angel that communed with me said unto me, Cry thou, saying, Haec dicit Dominus of Hosts, saying, I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Sion with great aemulatio, that is, zeal.</p>
<p>And I am greatly displeased with the gentes, that is, nations that are secundum quietem, that is, at ease: for when I was iratus, that is, angry but a little, they helped forward the affliction.</p>
<p>Therefore haec dicit Dominus, Thus saith the Lord; I am returned to Jerusalem with misericordia, that is, mercy: my domus, that is, house shall be built in it, saith the Lord of Hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Cry yet, saying, Haec dicit Dominus of Hosts; Yet my civitates shall flow with bonum, that is, good, and the Lord shall yet comfort Sion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.</p>
<p>And I lifted up mine oculus, that is, eyes, and saw, and behold four cornua, that is, horns.</p>
<p>And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What be these? And he answered me, These are the cornua, that is, horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.</p>
<p>And the Lord shewed me four fabri, that is, carpenters.</p>
<p>Then said I, What come these to do? And he spake, saying, These are the cornua, that is, horns which have scattered Judah, so that no man did lift up his caput, that is, head: but these are come to terrere, that is, frighten them, to cast out the cornua, that is, horns of the gentes, that is, nations, which lifted up their cornua, that is, horns over the terra, that is, earth of Judah to scatter it.</p>
