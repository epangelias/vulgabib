  "Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the ignis from heaven came down, and consumed the holocaustum, and the sacrifices; and the gloria of the Lord filled the templum.",
  "And the filii of Israel, that were present, went out, and sacrificed, and made holocausta, and pacified the Lord, and the rex, and the templum.",
  "And the rex, and all the Israelites, that were assembled, went before him, and sacrificed, and made pacificationes before the Lord.",
  "And Solomon sacrificed a holocaustum of twenty and two thousand boves, and an hundred and twenty thousand ovium; and the rex, and all the people, dedicated the templum of God.",
  "And the sacerdotes stood in their officium, and the Levites with instruments of musica, to give thanks to the Lord, as David rex of Israel had appointed.",
  "And the sacerdotes sounded with bucinae before them, and all Israel stood.",
  "Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the atrium, that was before the templum of the Lord; for there he offered the holocausta, and the adipem of the pacificationes, because the altar of brasium, which Solomon had made, was not sufficient to receive the holocausta, and the sacrificia, and the adipem.",
  "Also at the same time Solomon kept the festum seven dies, and all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Aegyptus.",
  "And in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly; for they kept the dedication of the altar seven dies, and the festum seven dies.",
  "And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh mense he sent the people away into their tabernacula, joyful and glad of heart for the beneficia that the Lord had shewed unto David, and to Solomon, and to Israel his people.",
  "Thus Solomon finished the templum of the Lord, and the rex's house; and all that Solomon desired to make in the templum of the Lord, and in his own house, he prosperously effected.",
  "And the Lord appeared to Solomon by nocte, and said unto him, I have heard thy oratio, and have chosen this place to myself for a templum of sacrificium.",
  "If I shut up caelum, that there be no imber, or if I command the locusta to devour the terra, or if I send pestilentia among my people;",
  "If my people, which are called by my nomine, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my faciem, and turn from their malae viae; then will I hear from caelum, and will forgive their peccata, and will heal their terra.",
  "Now mine oculi shall be open, and mine aures attent; and I will hear the oratio that is made in this loco.",
  "For now have I chosen, and sanctified this templum, to put my nomine there for ever; and mine oculi and mine cor shall be there perpetually.",
  "And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy pater walked, and do according to all that I have commanded thee, and shalt observe my statuta, and mine iudicia;",
  "Then will I stablish the thronus of thy regnum, according as I have covenanted with David thy pater, saying, Thou shalt not want a vir, a ruler in Israel.",
  "But if ye turn away, and forsake my statuta, and my mandata, which I have set before you, and shall go and serve other diis, and worship them;",
  "Then will I pluck them out of my terra, which I have given them; and this templum, which I have sanctified for my nomine, will I cast out of my sight, and will make it to be a proverb and a fabula among all nations.",
  "And this templum, which is high, shall be an example; every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why hath the Lord dealt thus with this terra, and with this templum?",
  "And they shall answer, Because they forsook the Lord their Deus, who brought forth their patres out of Aegyptus, and have taken hold upon other diis, and have worshipped them, and served them; therefore hath he brought all this malum upon them."
