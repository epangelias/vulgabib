  "The beginning of the evangelium of Iesus Christ, the Filii Dei.",
  "As it is written in the prophetes, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, qui preparet thy way.",
  "The vox clamantis in deserto, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his semitas rectas.",
  "Iohannes baptizavit in deserto, and preached the baptisma paenitentiae in remissionem peccatorum.",
  "And there went out to him all the Iudaei, and they of Hierosolymis, and were all baptized of him in flumine Iordane, confessing their peccata.",
  "Iohannes was clothed with camelorum pilis, and a zona pellicea circa lumbos suos, and he ate locustas et mel silvestre.",
  "And he preached, saying, Venit post me qui potentior est me, cuius non sum dignus, ut curvem genua eius, et solvam corrigiam caligae eius.",
  "I have baptized you with aqua, but he shall baptize you with Spiritu Sancto.",
  "And it came to pass in those dies, that Iesus venit ab Nazareth in Galilaea, and was baptized of Iohanne in Iordane.",
  "And forthwith coming up out of the aqua, he saw caelos apertos, and Spiritum Sanctum descendere sicut columbam super se.",
  "And there was vox de caelis, saying, Tu es Filius meus dilectus, in quo mihi complacui.",
  "And immediately the Spirit eiecit eum in desertum.",
  "And he was there in deserto quadraginta dies, and quadraginta noctes, temptatus a Satana, and was cum bestiis, and angeli ministrabant ei.",
  "Now after that Iohannes was delivered up, Iesus venit in Galilaeam, preaching evangelium regni Dei.",
  "And saying, The tempus is fulfilled, and regnum Dei is at hand, paenitentiam agite, et credite in evangelium.",
  "And as he walked by the mare Galilaeae, he saw Simonem, and Andream fratrem eius, mittentes retia in mare, erant enim piscatores.",
  "And Iesus said to them, Venite post me, et faciam vos fieri piscatores hominum.",
  "And at once they left their retia, and secuti sunt eum.",
  "And going on from thence, he saw Iacobum Zebedaei, et Iohannem fratrem eius, et ipsos in navi, reparamentes retia.",
  "And at once he called them, and relicta navi, et patre eorum Zebedaeo, secuti sunt eum.",
  "And they entered into Capharnaum, and forthwith die sabbati, he entered into synagogam, and taught.",
  "And they were astonished at his doctrina, erat enim docens eos quasi potestatem habens, et non sicut scribae.",
  "And there was in synagoga eorum homo in spiritu immundo, and he cried out, saying, Ah, quid nobis et tibi, Iesu Nazarene? venisti perdere nos? scio qui sis, Sanctus Dei.",
  "And Iesus comminatus est ei, dicens, Obmutesce, et exi ab homine.",
  "And the spiritus immundus eiecit vocem magnam, et exivit ab eo, et egressus est a synagoga, et non fecit ei malum.",
  "And they were all admirati, ita ut interrogarent inter se, dicens, Quid est hoc? quae doctrina nova? quia in potestate et spiritibus immundis imperat, et oboediunt ei.",
  "And the fama eius egressa est in omnes fines per circuitum Galilaeae.",
  "And forthwith leaving the synagogam, they came into domum Simonis, et Andreae, cum Iacobo et Iohanne.",
  "And the mother-in-law of Simon lay in febre, and forthwith they tell him of her.",
  "And he came, and raised her up, taking her manum, and forthwith the febris reliquit eam, and she ministered unto them.",
  "And when the sol was set, all they that had infirmos, vel daemonia, brought them unto him.",
  "And the whole civitas was gathered together at the porta, and he healed multos, qui vexabantur a variis languoribus, et eiecit daemonia multa, et non sinebat loqui daemonia, quia sciebant eum.",
  "And rising very early, going out, he went into a desert place, and there prayed.",
  "And Simon, and they that were with him, followed after him, and found him, and they say to him, Omnes quaerunt te.",
  "And he said to them, Eamus in proximas civitates, ut et ibi praedicem, ad hoc enim veni.",
  "And he was preaching in synagogis eorum, et in omni Galilaea, et eiciebat daemonia.",
  "And there came a leprosus ad eum, rogans eum, et genu flexo, dicens, Si vis, potes me mundare.",
  "And Iesus, misericordia motus, extendit manum, et tetigit eum, et dixit, Volo, mundare.",
  "And when he had spoken, the lepra abiit ab eo, et mundatus est.",
  "And he straitly charged him, and forthwith eiecit eum, and said to him, See thou say nothing to any man, sed vade, ostende te sacerdoti, et offer pro emundatione tua, quae praecepit Moses, in testimonium eis.",
  "But he, egressus, coepit multum praedicare, et diffamare sermonem, ita ut Iesus iam non posset manifeste in civitatem introire, sed in desertis locis, et veniebant ad eum undique."
