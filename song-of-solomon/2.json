  "My dilectus is mine, and I am his: he feedeth among the lilia.",
  "As the malus is sweet to my palate, so is my dilectus sweet to me.",
  "He bringeth me to the domus of vinum, and his signum over me is amor.",
  "Sustentent me with floribus, and comfort me with malis: for I am languid with amor.",
  "His left manus is under my caput, and his dextera shall embrace me.",
  "I charge you, O filiae Ierusalem, by the capri, and by the cervi of the campi, that ye stir not up, nor awake my dilectus, till he please.",
  "The vox of my dilectus! behold, he cometh leaping upon the montes, skipping upon the colles.",
  "My dilectus is like a cervus, or a young caper: behold, he standeth behind our paries, looking forth at the fenestrae, shewing himself through the cancelli.",
  "My dilectus spake, and said unto me, Surge, my dilecta, my pulchra, and come away.",
  "For, behold, the hiems is past, the pluvia is over and gone; The flos appear on the terra, and the tempus of the pruning of the vites is come, and the vox of the turdus is heard in our terra.",
  "The flos of the sycomorus appear, and the vites flourish: Arise, my dilecta, my pulchra, and come away.",
  "O my columba, that art in the abscissis of the petra, in the secretis of the scala, shew me thy facies, let me hear thy vox; for thy vox is dulcis, and thy facies is decora.",
  "Take us the vulpes, the little vulpes, that spoil the vineyards; for our vineyard hath flos.",
  "My dilectus is mine, and I am his: he feedeth among the lilia.",
  "Till the dies be cool, and the umbra flee away, turn, my dilectus, and be thou like a cervus, or a young caper upon the montes of Bether."
