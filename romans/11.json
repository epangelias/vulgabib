  "I say then, Hath Deus cast away his people? Deus forbid. For I also am Israelita, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.",
  "Deus hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the Scriptura saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to Deus against Israel, saying,",
  "Domine, they have killed thy prophetas, and digged down thine altaria; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.",
  "But what saith the responsio of Deus unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand homines, who have not bowed knee to Baal.",
  "Even so then at this present time also, there is a remnant according to the electio gratiae.",
  "And if by gratia, then is it no more ex operibus: otherwise gratia is no more gratia. But if it be ex operibus, then is it no more gratia: otherwise work is no more work.",
  "What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the electio hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded",
  "According as it is written, Deus hath given them the spiritus stuporis, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear; unto this day.",
  "And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a retributio unto them:",
  "Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway.",
  "I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? Deus forbid: but rather through their fall, salvus is come unto the gentes, for to provoke them to zelus.",
  "Now if the fall of them be the riches of the mundus, and the diminutio of them the riches of the gentes; how much more their plenitudo?",
  "For I speak to you gentes, inasmuch as I am the apostolus of the gentes, I magnify mine officium:",
  "If by any means I may provoke to zelus mine own carnem, and might save some of them.",
  "For if the firstfruits be sanctus, the lump is also: and if the radix be sanctus, so are the rami.",
  "Because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by fide. Be not highminded, but fear:",
  "For if Deus spared not the naturalem ramos, take heed lest he also spare not thee.",
  "Behold therefore the benignitas of Deus and severitas: on them which fell, severitas; but toward thee, benignitas, if thou continue in his benignitas: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.",
  "And they also, if they abide not still in incredulitas, shall be graffed in: for Deus is potent to graff them in again.",
  "For if thou wert cut out of the oliva which is wild by natura, and wert graffed contrary to natura into a good oliva: how much more shall these, which be the naturalem rami, be graffed into their own oliva?",
  "For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mysterium, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the plenitudo of the gentes be come in,",
  "And so all Israel shall be salvus: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:",
  "For this is my testament unto them: when I shall take away their peccata.",
  "As concerning the Evangelium, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the electio, they are beloved for the patres' sakes.",
  "For the dona and the vocatio of Deus are without paenitentia.",
  "For as ye in times past were disobedientes to Deus, but now have obtained misericordiam through their disobedientia:",
  "Even so have these also now been disobedientes; that through your misericordiam they also may obtain misericordiam.",
  "For Deus hath concluded them all in incredulitas, that he might have misericordiam upon all.",
  "O the profunditas of the divitiarum of the sapientia and scientia of Deus! how unsearchable are his judicia, and his viae past finding out!",
  "For who hath known the mens of Domine? or who hath been his consiliarius?",
  "Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?",
  "For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be gloria in sempiternum. Amen."
