                    <p>Keep silent before me, O islands; and let the people renew their strength: let them come near; then let them speak, let us come near together to judgment.</p>
<p>Who raised up the justum, and gave him dominion over the kings? he gave them gladium, and they prevailed.</p>
<p>He pursued them, and passed safely; and the via was not found of them, nor the loci of their pedes.</p>
<p>Who hath wrought and done it, calling the generations from the principio? I, Jehovah, the primus; and with the novissimus I am he.</p>
<p>The isles saw it, and feared; the fines of the earth were afraid, drew near, and came.</p>
<p>They helped every one his neighbour; and every one said to his brother, Be of boni animus.</p>
<p>The faber encouraged the aurifex, and he that smootheth with the malleus him that smote the incus, saying, It is perfect for the clavus: and he fastened it with nails, that it should not be moved.</p>
<p>But thou, Israel, art my servus, Jacob whom I have chosen, the semen of Abraham my amicus.</p>
<p>Thou whom I have taken from the fines of the earth, and called thee from the clavus thereof, and said unto thee, Thou art my servus; I have chosen thee, and not rejected thee.</p>
<p>Fear not, for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy Deus: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the dextera of my justitia.</p>
<p>Behold, all they that were incensed against thee shall be ashamed and confounded: they shall be as nothing; and they that strive with thee shall perish.</p>
<p>Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not find them, even them that contended with thee: they that war against thee shall be as nothing, and as a thing of nihili.</p>
<p>For I, Jehovah, thy Deus, will hold thy dextera, saying unto thee, Fear not; I will help thee.</p>
<p>Fear not, thou worm Jacob, and ye men of Israel; I will help thee, saith Jehovah, and thy Redemptor, the Sanctus of Israel.</p>
<p>Behold, I will make thee a new threshing instrument having dentes, thou shalt thresh the montes, and beat them small, and shalt make the colles as the chaff.</p>
<p>Thou shalt fan them, and the ventus shall carry them away, and the turbo shall scatter them: and thou shalt rejoice in Jehovah, and shalt glory in the Sancto of Israel.</p>
<p>When the pauper and needy seek water, and there is none, and their lingua faileth for thirst, I, Jehovah, will hear them, I, the Deus of Israel, will not forsake them.</p>
<p>I will open rivers in high loca, and fountains in medio of the valles: I will make the desert a lacus of aqua, and the dry terra fountains of aqua.</p>
<p>I will plant in the desert the cedrus, the acacia tree, and the myrtle, and the oliva tree: I will set in the desert the cypress tree, and the pine, and the fir tree together:</p>
<p>That they may see, and know, and consider, and understand together, that the manus of Jehovah hath done this, and the Sanctus of Israel hath created it.</p>
<p>Produce your causam, saith Jehovah; bring forth your testimonium, saith the Rex of Jacob.</p>
<p>Let them bring forth, and declare unto us what shall be in futurum: declare ye the former things, what they be, that we may consider them, and know the novissima of them; or declare unto us the nova that are to come.</p>
<p>Declare unto us things to come hereafter, that we may know that ye are dei: yea, do good, or do evil, that we may be dismayed, and behold it with you.</p>
<p>Behold, ye are of nihili, and your opus of nihili: an abomination is every one that delighteth in you.</p>
<p>I have raised up one from the aquilon, and he shall come: from the rising of the sol he shall be called upon my nomine: and he shall come upon potentes as the limus, and as the faber treadeth clay.</p>
<p>Who hath declared from the principio, that we may know? and beforetime, that we may say, He is justus? yea, there is none that declareth, yea, there is none that sheweth, yea, there is none that heareth your vocem.</p>
<p>I have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when there was no strange deus among you: therefore ye are testes unto me, saith Jehovah, that I am Deus.</p>
<p>Yea, before the dies was I am; and there is none that can deliver out of my manus: I will work, and who shall hinder it?</p>
<p>Thus saith Jehovah, your Redemptor, the Sanctus of Israel; For your causa I have sent to Babylon, and have brought down all their fugitives, whose clamor is in the navis.</p>
