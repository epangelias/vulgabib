  "The king shall joy in thy strength, O Domine, and in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice!",
  "Thou hast given him his cor, O Domine, and hast not withholden the request of his lips.",
  "For thou preventest him with benedictiones of bonus, thou settest a corona of aurum on his caput.",
  "He asked life of thee, and thou gavest it him, even length of dies for ever and ever.",
  "His honor is great in thy salvation: honor and majesty hast thou laid upon him.",
  "For thou hast made him most blessed for ever: thou hast made him joyful with felicitas.",
  "For the king trusteth in the Domine, and through the clementia of the Altissimus he shall not be moved.",
  "Thine hand shall find out all thine inimici: thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee.",
  "Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thy facies: the Domine shall swallow them up in his ira, and the fire shall devour them.",
  "Their fructus shalt thou destroy from the terra, and their semen from among the filii of men.",
  "For they intended malum against thee: they imagined a consilium, but they are not able to perform it.",
  "Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back, when thou shalt make ready thy arcus against the facies of them.",
  "Be thou exalted, Domine, in thy potentia: so will we sing and praise thy potentia."
