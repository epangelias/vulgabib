                    <p>Then said the Lord unto me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of her friend, and an adulteress, according to the love of the Lord toward the filii Israel, who look to other deos, and love flagitia, and grapes.</p>
<p>So I bought her to me for quindecim pieces of argentum, and for an homer of hordeum, and an half homer of hordeum.</p>
<p>And I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many dies; thou shalt not be meretrix, thou shalt not be uxor to any other homo.</p>
<p>For the filii Israel shall abide many dies without rex, and without prince, and without sacrificium, and without ephod, and without teraphim:</p>
<p>Afterward shall the filii Israel return, and seek the Lord their Deus, and David their rex; and shall fear the Lord and his bonitas in the novissimum dies.</p>
