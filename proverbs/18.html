                    <p>Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh and intermeddleth with all wisdom. (1)</p>
<p>A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his cor (heart) may discover itself. (2)</p>
<p>When the impious cometh, then cometh contempt, and with ignominia (ignominy) reproach. (3)</p>
<p>The words of a man's mouth are as deep waters, and the font (fountain) of wisdom as an overflowing rivus (brook). (4)</p>
<p>It is not good to accept the person of the prince (princeps) for the persona (person) of the poor. (5)</p>
<p>The just shall compass (circumducere) the iniquities of the impious: and in his justitia (justice) he shall be exalted. (6)</p>
<p>The foolishness of a man subverteth his via (way): and his cor (heart) is indignant against the Lord. (7)</p>
<p>The words of a man's mouth are a deep rivus (brook): the fons (spring) of wisdom is the mouth of the just. (8)</p>
<p>The king that sitteth in throne judicat (judge) separateth the impious, and his oculus (eye) is against the iniquitous. (9)</p>
<p>The fons (spring) of wisdom is the fear of the Lord, and the scientia (science) of the saints is understanding. (10)</p>
<p>For the virtus (virtue) of wisdom shall be given to the just, and he shall not be moved by the formido (fear) of malum (evil). (11)</p>
<p>The memoria (memory) of the just shall be in benedictione (blessing), and the nomen (name) of the impious shall rot. (12)</p>
<p>He that beginneth to edifice (build) and is not able to finish shall be laughed at by all that pass by. (13)</p>
<p>The just shall be in the confidentia (confidence) of the virtus (virtue) of wisdom, and the timor (fear) of the Lord is his spes (hope). (14)</p>
<p>The rex (king) by the judicium (judgment) of his facies (face) maketh the pauper (poor) and the divitiae (rich) to be quiet. (15)</p>
<p>Mercy and veritas (truth) preserve the rex (king), and his throne is confirmed by clementia (clemency). (16)</p>
<p>The ira (anger) of the rex (king) is as messores (reapers), and they that provoke him to ira (anger) lose their anima (soul). (17)</p>
<p>The memoria (memory) of the just shall be in benedictione (blessing), but the nomen (name) of the impious shall rot. (18)</p>
<p>The cor (heart) of the prudent shall possess scientia (science), and the os (mouth) of the stultus (fool) shall be for destruction. (19)</p>
<p>Poverty and ignominia (ignominy) shall be to him that is negligent in negotium (business), and the manus (hand) of the sollers (diligent) shall be enriched. (20)</p>
<p>He that walketh with the just and sinner shall be alike, but he that is not with the iniquitous shall be saved. (21)</p>
<p>The stultus (fool) shall not be in pace (peace) though he be filius (son) to the king: but the prudent shall be pacificus (peaceful) in his domus (house). (22)</p>
<p>The stultus (fool) shall not be in pace (peace) though he be filius (son) to the king: but the prudent shall be pacificus (peaceful) in his domus (house). (23)</p>
<p>The iniquus (wicked) shall be given for the just, and the impius (impious) for the rectus (righteous). (24)</p>
