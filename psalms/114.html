                    <p>When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange lingua,</p>
<p>Judah was his sanctuarium, and Israel his dominium.</p>
<p>The mare, it was the Red Sea, and it turned back, and the aqua returned to its proprium locum,</p>
<p>And they went through the medium of the mare, as per agrum,</p>
<p>And the aqua was a murus to them on their dexter side and on their sinister side.</p>
<p>The gentes saw them, and they were terrifyed, and they fled, and they were dissipati,</p>
<p>The mare covered them, and they were absorpti in the profundum, as lapides.</p>
<p>Nunc, Israel, gaude, and make a cantus to the Domino, qui te fecit,</p>
<p>And honor his nomen, because he is magnus, and his misericordia is in aeternum.</p>
