                    <p>And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak unto thee, and the Spiritus of the Lord fell upon me, and set me upon my feet, that I heard him that spake unto me.</p>
<p>And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the filii of Israel, to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me: they and their patres have transgressed against me, even unto this very day.</p>
<p>And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they are a rebellious domus,) yet shall know that there hath been a propheta among them.</p>
<p>And thou, son of man, fear not, neither be afraid of them, though they be a rebellious domus, and thou shalt speak my verba unto them, and they shall hear, or forbear, for they are most rebellious.</p>
<p>But thou, O son of man, hear what I say unto thee; Be not thou rebellious, as that rebellious domus: open thy mouth, and eat that I give thee.</p>
<p>And when I looked, behold, an manus was sent unto me; and, lo, a volumen was therein; And he spread it before me; and it was written within and without: and there was written therein lamentation, and mors, and wailing.</p>
<p>Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest; eat this volumen, and go speak unto the domus of Israel.</p>
<p>So I opened my mouth, and he gave me this volumen to eat;</p>
<p>And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy ventrem with this volumen which I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as mel.</p>
<p>And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the domus of Israel, and speak with my verba unto them.</p>
<p>For thou art not sent to a gentem of a barbarous sermone, but to the domus of Israel;</p>
<p>Not to many gentes of barbarous sermonis and of unknown linguis, whose wordes thou canst not understand. surely, had I sent thee to them, they would have hearkened unto thee.</p>
<p>But the domus of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the domus of Israel are impudent and hardhearted.</p>
<p>Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy frontem strong against their frontem.</p>
<p>As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy frontem: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their visages, though they be a rebellious domus.</p>
<p>Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my verba that I shall speak unto thee, receive in thy cor, and hear with thine aures:</p>
<p>And go, get thee to them of the captivitas, unto the filii of thy populus, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith Dominus Deus; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.</p>
