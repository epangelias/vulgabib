                    <p>I say the veritas, in Christus I lie not, my conscientia also bearing me witness in the Spiritus Sanctus,</p>
<p>That I have great tristitia and continual dolor in my cor,</p>
<p>For I could wish that myself were anathema from Christus for my fratres, my kinsmen according to the caro:</p>
<p>Who are Israelites; to whom pertaineth the adoptio, and the gloria, and the testamenta, and the giving of the Legem, and the servitium of Deus, and the promissa;</p>
<p>Whose are the patres, and of whom as concerning the caro Christus came, who is over all, Deus benedictus in saecula. Amen.</p>
<p>Not as though the verbum of Deus hath taken none effect. For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel:</p>
<p>Neither, because they are the semen of Abraham, are they all filii: but, In Isaac shall thy semen be called.</p>
<p>That is, They which are the filii of the carne, these are not the filii of Deus: but the filii of the promissa are counted for the semen.</p>
<p>For this is the verbum of promissa, According to this tempus I will come, and Sara shall have a filius.</p>
<p>And not only this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, even by our pater Isaac;</p>
<p>For the filii being not yet nati, neither having done any bonum or malum, that the propositum of Deus according to electio might stand, not of opera, but of him that calleth;</p>
<p>It was said unto her, The maior shall serve the minor.</p>
<p>As it is written, Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.</p>
<p>What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with Deus? Deus forbid.</p>
<p>For he saith to Moses, I will have misericordia on whom I will have misericordia, and I will have clementia on whom I will have clementia.</p>
<p>So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of Deus that sheweth misericordia.</p>
<p>For the Scriptura saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my potentia in thee, and that my nomen might be declared throughout all the terra.</p>
<p>Therefore hath he misericordia on whom he will have misericordia, and whom he will he hardeneth.</p>
<p>Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his voluntas?</p>
<p>Nay but, O homo, who art thou that repliest against Deus? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?</p>
<p>Hath not the potter potentia over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honorem, and another unto contumeliam?</p>
<p>What if Deus, willing to shew his ira, and to make his potentia known, endured with much longanimitas the vessels of ira fitted to destruction:</p>
<p>And that he might make known the riches of his gloria on the vessels of misericordia, which he had afore prepared unto gloria,</p>
<p>Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Iudaei only, but also of the Gentiles?</p>
<p>As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my populus, which were not my populus; and her beloved, which was not beloved.</p>
<p>And it shall come to pass, that in the loco where it was said unto them, Ye are not my populus; there shall they be called the filii of the Deus vivus.</p>
<p>Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the numerus of the filii of Israel be as the arena of the mari, a reliquum shall be salvus:</p>
<p>For he will finish the opus, and cut it short in justitia: because a brevitas of opus will Deus make upon the terra.</p>
<p>And as Esaias said before, Except the Deus Sabaoth had left us a semen, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorra.</p>
<p>What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after justitia, have attained to justitia, even the justitia which is of fide:</p>
<p>But Israel, which followed after the lex of justitia, hath not attained to the lex of justitia.</p>
<p>Wherefore? Because they sought it not by fide, but as it were by opera of the lex. For they stumbled at that petra of scandalon;</p>
<p>As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a petra of scandalon and a petra of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be confusus.</p>
