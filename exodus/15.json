  "Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this cantica, and spake, saying, I will sing unto the Domine, for he hath triumphed gloriously: the equus and his rider hath he thrown into mare.",
  "The Domine is my fortitudo and canorus, and he is become my salus: he is my Deus, and I will praisefully magnific him: my father's Deus, and I will exalt him.",
  "The Domine is a man of bello, and the Domine is his name.",
  "Pharaoh's currus and his exercitus hath he cast into mare: his electi praecones also are drowned in the mare Rubro.",
  "The abyssi, as it were, have covered them: they went down into the abyssi, as a petra into the abyssal profundum.",
  "Thy dexter, O Domine, is glorious in potentia: thy dexter, O Domine, hath shattered the inimicus.",
  "And with the greatness of thy gloria, thou hast destroyed thy adversaries: thou hast sent forth thy furorem, and it hath consummated them: they were as a combustio of ignis.",
  "With the flatus of thy narix, the diluvium were gathered, the abyssi also were conglaciati, the abyssi also were coagulati in the middle of mare.",
  "The inimicus said, I will persequor, I will overtake, I will dividere the spolia: my animus shall be saturate of them: I will evaginare my gladius, my manus shall destroy them.",
  "Thou didst flatus with thy flatus, and the mare covered them: they descendebant as plumbum in the abyssal profundum.",
  "Who is sicut te, O Domine, inter dii? who is sicut te, glorificus in sanctimonia, terribilis in laudes, faciens miracula?",
  "Thou stretchedest out thy manum dexteram, and the terra absorbuit them.",
  "Thou hast led forth in misericordia populum tuum, whom thou hast redemptus: thou hast ductus in fortitudo to habitaculum sanctum tuum.",
  "Populi audient, and they tremble: dolor takes hold on the inhabitants of Philistaea.",
  "Then the ducem of Edom shall be in a consternation, and the potentates of Moab: the manu of every laborans in corda shall languere.",
  "Tunc populus Zion, and thou shalt hereditare terram Chanaan.",
  "Thou shalt extend thy manus, and they shall fugere: thou shalt send forth thy furorem, and they shall devorari.",
  "Sicut ignis exardescit faciem flammulae, thus shall thou persequor inimicos tuos: and in indignatione tua, thou shalt devorare them, as a combustio of ignis.",
  "Thou shalt congelare terram in fine: and thou shalt divulgare nationes, and shalt dissipare eos.",
  "Thou didst flatus with thy flatus, and the mare dividitur: and the aqaus were separatim as a paries.",
  "And the populus transivit per mare, as if by the terra sicca: and the aqaus were to them as a murus, a laeva and a dextra.",
  "And the Domine did persequor the hostem of Pharaonem with the currus, and with the equites in the mare: and the Israelites did fugere, with sicca pedibus, through the mare of Rubrum.",
  "And it came to pass, that when the Pharaonem and his exercitus were persequuti the Israelitas, and had repleti the mare of Rubrum, and the Israelitas did ambulare through the sicca terra, that the Domine did respicere upon the exercitus of the Pharaonem, and did vide eos.",
  "And the Domine did dicere, Ego videbo, quid faciat Pharao: Pharao, namque, did dicere, Fugiant Hebraei: for Pharaonem did dicere, The Domine hath frustrated their via: and the terra did congelare, and the mare did reverti to the locus suus, and did circumdare the exercitus of the Pharaonem, who did persequuti them.",
  "Thus did the Domine salvare the Israelitas that day from the manus of the Pharaonem: and the Israelitas did videre the exercitus of the Pharaonem mortuos in the terra: and they did intellegere, that the Domine had fecit salus Israel: and they did credere in the Domine, and in Moysem servum eius.",
  "Then Moses and the filii of Israel did cantare this cantica ad Dominum, and did dicere, saying, Ego videbo, quid faciat Pharao: for Pharaonem did dicere, Fugiant Hebraei: and the terra did congelare, and the mare did reverti to the locus suus, and did circumdare the exercitus of the Pharaonem, who did persequuti them.",
  "Thus did the Domine salvare the Israelitas that day from the manus of the Pharaonem: and the Israelitas did videre the exercitus of the Pharaonem mortuos in the terra: and they did intellegere, that the Domine had fecit salus Israel: and they did credere in the Domine, and in Moysem servum eius."
