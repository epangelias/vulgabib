                    <p>1. Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy vox like a shofar, and shew my people their transgressions, and the domus of Jacob their sins.</p>
<p>2. Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my via, as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the iudicia of their Deus, they ask of me the iudicia of iustitia, they will to be near me:</p>
<p>3. Wherefore have we fasted, say they, and thou seest not? wherefore have we afflicted our anima, and thou takest no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your fast ye find pleasuria, and exact all your labores.</p>
<p>4. Behold, ye fast for sedition, and strife, and to smite with the pugnus of malice: ye shall not fast as ye do this day, to make your vox to be heard on high.</p>
<p>5. Is it such a ieiunium that I have chosen? a day for a homo to afflict his anima? is it to bow down his caput as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and cinere under him? wilt thou call this a ieiunium, and an acceptable day to Iehovah?</p>
<p>6. Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the fasces of malice, to undo the vincula of the yoke, and to let the oppressus go liber, and that ye break every iugum?</p>
<p>7. Is it not to deal thy panis to the famelic, and that thou bring the egeni into thy domus? when thou seest the nudum, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own carne?</p>
<p>8. Then shall thy lux break forth as the aurora, and thy healing shall speedily arise: and thy iustitia shall go before thee; the Gloria of Iehovah shall gather thee.</p>
<p>9. Then shalt thou call, and Iehovah shall respond; thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Ecce, I am here. If thou take away from the midst of thee the iugum, the lifting up of the digit, and speaking vanitatem;</p>
<p>10. And if thou draw out thy anima to the esurienti, and satisfy the desideria of the affligens animam: then shall thy tenebrae be as the meridies:</p>
<p>11. And Iehovah shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy desideria in a terra arida, and make strong thy ossa: and thou shalt be like a hortus of irrigable water, and like a fons of water, whose aquae fail not.</p>
<p>12. And they that shall be of thee shall edify the antiquas ruinæ, thou shalt restore the stratas of generationum, and thou shalt repair the fissuras of the strata: thou shalt rise up the vetus ruins:</p>
<p>13. If thou turn away thy pes from sabbathum, from doing thy voluntas in my sanctum dieu: if thou call the sabbathum a delicia, a holy day of Iehovah, honorabile:</p>
<p>14. If thou shalt turn back thy anima from doing thy voluntas on my sanctum dieu: and shalt honor the sabbathum, in not following thy via, and not doing thy voluntas, nor speaking vanitatem:</p>
<p>15. Then shalt thou delight in Iehovah, and I shall causare thee above the montes of the terra: and feed thee with hereditas of Iacob thy pater, for the os of Iehovah hath spoken it.</p>
<p>16. Then shalt thou be called, the Reparatrix of the strata, the Restauratrix of the viæ of old; thou shalt be called the citas of Iehovah, the Zion of the Sanctus Israel:</p>
<p>17. If thou shalt turn away from following thy voluntas in the dies sanctus of Iehovah, in making tibi delicias, and not doing tibi voluntas on the sanctus dieu:</p>
<p>18. Then shalt thou delight in Iehovah, and shalt causare super montes terrae; thou shalt be fed with the hereditas of Iacob thy pater, for the os of Iehovah hath spoken it.</p>
