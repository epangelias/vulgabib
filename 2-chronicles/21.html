                    <p>And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David, and Jehoram his filius reigned in his stead.</p>
<p>And he had fratres, the filii of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah: all these were the filii of Jehoshaphat rex of Israel.</p>
<p>And their pater gave them dona, argentum, and aurum, and pretiosas, with civitates in Judah: but the regnum gave he to Jehoram; because he was the primogenitus.</p>
<p>Now when Jehoram had risen up to the regnum of his pater, he strengthened himself, and slew all his fratres with gladio, and divers also of the principes of Israel.</p>
<p>Jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to regnare, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>And he walked in the via of the reges of Israel, like as did the domus of Ahab: for he had the filia of Ahab in matrimonium: and he did malum in the sight of the Dominus.</p>
<p>Howbeit the Dominus would not destroy the domus of David, because of the foedus that he had made with David, and as he had promised to give a lampada to him and to his filiis for ever.</p>
<p>In his dies the Edomites revolted from under the dominium of Judah, and made themselves a rex.</p>
<p>Then Jehoram went forth with his principes, and all his currus with him: and he rose up by nocte, and smote the Edomites which compassed him in, and the principes of the currus.</p>
<p>So the Edomites revolted from under the dominium of Judah unto this day. The same time also did Libnah revolt from under his dominium; because he had forsaken the Dominus Deus of his patres.</p>
<p>Moreover he made excelsa in the montibus of Judah, and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to fornicate, and compelled Judah thereto.</p>
<p>And there came a libellus to him from Elijah the propheta, saying, Thus saith the Dominus Deus of David thy pater, Because thou hast not walked in the via of Jehoshaphat thy pater, nor in the via of Asa rex of Judah,</p>
<p>But hast walked in the via of the reges of Israel, and hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to fornicate, like to the forniciation of the domus of Ahab, and also hast slain thy fratres of the domus of thy pater, which were better than thyself:</p>
<p>Behold, with morbus the Dominus will smite thy populum, and thy filii, and thy uxores, and all thy substance:</p>
<p>And thou shalt have great morbus by disease of thy intestines, until thy intestines fall out by reason of the morbus day by day.</p>
<p>Moreover the Dominus stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians, that were near the Ethiopians:</p>
<p>And they came up into Judah, and brake into it, and carried away all the substance that was found in the domus of the rex, and his filii also, and his uxores; so that there was never a filius left him, save Jehoahaz, the youngest of his filii.</p>
<p>And after all this the Dominus smote him in his intestines with an incurable morbus.</p>
<p>And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of two years, his intestines fell out by reason of his morbus: so he died of sore morbus. And his populus made no funus for him, like unto the funus of his patres.</p>
<p>Thirty and two years old was he when he began to regnare, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years, and departed without being desired. Howbeit they buried him in the civitas of David, but not in the sepulchra of the reges.</p>
