  "O Deus, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even with my glory.",
  "Awake, psaltery and harp; I myself will awake early, aurora.",
  "I will praise thee, O Deus, among the gentes; I will sing unto thee among the nations.",
  "For thy misericordia is magnus above the coelum; thy veritas reacheth unto the nubes.",
  "Be thou exalted, O Deus, above the coelum; and thy gloria above all terra;",
  "That thy dilectus may be delivered; save with thy right manus, and answer me.",
  "Deus hath spoken in his sanctuario; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the vallis of Succoth.",
  "Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the fortitudo of my caput; Judah is my legislator;",
  "Moab is my lavacrum; over Edom will I cast my calceus; Philistia, be thou glad of me.",
  "Who will bring me into the civitas of munitio, who will lead me into Edom?",
  "Wilt not thou, O Deus, who hast cast us off? and wilt not thou, O Deus, go forth with our exercitus?",
  "Give us help from trouble; for vana is the salvus of man.",
  "Through Deus we shall do valiantly; for he it is that shall calcat our inimicus."
