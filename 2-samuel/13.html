                    <p>And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a fair soror, whose nomen was Tamar; she was a pulchra soror.</p>
<p>And Amnon the son of David loved her, and it came to pass, that Amnon was anxius, so that he fell sick for his soror Tamar; for she was a virgo, and Amnon thought it difficile to do any thing to her.</p>
<p>But Amnon had a friend, whose nomen was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's frater: and Jonadab was a vir sapiens.</p>
<p>And he said unto him, Why art thou, being the filius of the rex, anxius from dies to dies? Wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto him, I love Tamar, my soror.</p>
<p>And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy lectus, and make thyself sick: and when thy pater cometh to visit thee, say unto him, I pray thee, let my soror Tamar come, and give me cibus, that I may see her, and eat of her manus.</p>
<p>So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the rex was come to visit him, Amnon said unto the rex, I pray thee, let Tamar my soror come, and make me a couple of panis, that I may eat of her manus.</p>
<p>Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy frater Amnon's domus, and make him cibus.</p>
<p>And Tamar went to her frater Amnon's domus; and he was in lectus. And she took massa, and kneaded it, and made panis in his oculi; and she took the panis, and fried it.</p>
<p>And she took a formam, and poured it out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all homines from me. And they went out every homines from him.</p>
<p>And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the cibus into the cubiculum, that I may eat of thy manus. And Tamar took a couple of panis, and brought them unto her frater Amnon into the cubiculum.</p>
<p>And when she had brought them unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my soror.</p>
<p>And she answered him, Nay, my frater, do not vex me: for no such res is done in Israel: do not this stultitia.</p>
<p>And I, whither shall I cause my ignominia to go? and as for thee, thou shalt be as one of the stulti in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the rex; for he will not withhold me from thee.</p>
<p>Howbeit he would not hearken unto her vox: but, being stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her.</p>
<p>Then Amnon hated her with exceeding great odio, so that the odio wherewith he hated her was greater than the amor wherewith he had loved her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.</p>
<p>And she said unto him, There is no causa: this malum in sending me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me. But he would not hearken unto her.</p>
<p>Then he called his puer, that ministered unto him, and said, Put now this mulier out from me, and bolt the ostium after her.</p>
<p>And she had a vestis of divers colours upon her: for with such vestes were the filiae of the rex that were virgins apparelled. Then his puer brought her out, and bolted the ostium after her.</p>
<p>And Tamar put ashes on her caput, and rent her vestis of divers colours that was on her, and laid her manus on her caput, and went on crying.</p>
<p>And Absalom her frater said unto her, Hath Amnon thy frater been with thee? but hold now thy peace, my soror: he is thy frater; regard not this res. So Tamar remained, and was desolata in her frater Absalom's domus.</p>
<p>But when rex David heard of all these res, he was very iratus.</p>
<p>And Absalom spake unto his frater Amnon neither bonum nor malum: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his soror Tamar.</p>
<p>And it came to pass after two anni, that Absalom had a tonsor in Baal-hazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the filii of the rex.</p>
<p>And Absalom came to the rex, and said, Behold now, thy servant hath a tonsor; let the rex, I pray thee, and his servientes go with thy servant.</p>
<p>And the rex said to Absalom, Nay, my filius, let us not now all go, lest we be charge to thee. And he pressed him: howbeit he would not go, but blessed him.</p>
<p>Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my frater Amnon go with us. And the rex said unto him, Why should he go with thee?</p>
<p>But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the filii of the rex go with him.</p>
<p>Now the rex's words were as follows: Who shall go with Absalom? and all the filii of the rex arose, and went with Absalom.</p>
<p>And Absalom sent for all the Israelites, and they came to the festa, as the rex had commanded, and the festa was prepared.</p>
<p>And Absalom commanded his pueri, saying, Mark ye now when Amnon's cor is merry with vinum, and when I say unto you, Smite Amnon; then slay him, fear not: have not I commanded you? be courageous, and be valentes.</p>
<p>And the pueri of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the filii of the rex arose, and every man gat him up upon his mulus, and fled.</p>
<p>And it came to pass, while they were in the via, that tidings came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the filii of the rex, and there is not one of them left.</p>
<p>Then the rex arose, and rent his vestes, and lay on the terra; and all his servientes stood by with their vestes rent.</p>
<p>And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's frater, answered and said, Let not my dominus suppose that they have slain all the iuvenes filii of the rex; for Amnon only is mortuus: for by the os of Absalom it was appointed against Amnon from the dies that he forced his soror Tamar.</p>
<p>Now therefore let not my dominus the rex take the res to his cor, to think that all the filii of the rex are mortui: for Amnon only is mortuus.</p>
<p>But Absalom fled. And the puer that kept the watch lifted up his oculi, and looked, and, behold, there came much populus by the via of the collis behind him.</p>
<p>And Jonadab said unto the rex, Behold, the filii of the rex come: as thy servant said, so it is.</p>
<p>And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the filii of the rex came, and lifted up their voces and wept: and the rex also and all his servientes wept very sore.</p>
<p>And Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, rex of Geshur. And David mourned for his filius every day.</p>
<p>So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three anni.</p>
<p>And the animus of rex David was pacified toward Absalom, seeing he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was mortuus.</p>
