  "And he shewed me Ioshua the high priest, standing before the angel of Dominus, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him.",
  "In that day, saith Dominus of hosts, take thee unto thee him that is a servant, a poor and a beggar, and put upon him the vestimentum of principem, and the diadem of gloria.",
  "And the angel of Dominus protested unto Ioshua, saying,",
  "Thus speaketh Dominus of hosts, saying, If thou wilt walk in viam meam, and keep the custodiam meam, thou shalt also judicare domum meam, and keep the atrium meam, and I will give thee ambulare inter istos qui stant hic.",
  "O Ioshua, summus sacerdos, thou and thy socii that stand before thee, are indeed viri miraculi, because I shall bring forth servum meum the Orientem.",
  "For, behold, the lapidem, which I have laid before Ioshua, upon one lapide shall be seven oculi, and, behold, I will engraven the sculpturam of it, saith Dominus of hosts, and I will remove the iniquitatem of this terra in one die.",
  "Thus speaketh Dominus of hosts, saying, In that die shall ye invite the unus ad alterum, under the vites, and under the ficus.",
  "For, behold, I will send my angelum, and he shall custodire viam, that ye may walk in it, and when ye hear the sonus of the bucina, and the clangor of the cymbalum, and the voice of the populus, ye shall say, Benedictus Dominus qui venit in nomine Domini, and ye shall give gloria to Dominus of hosts, and to the civitas of Ierusalem."
