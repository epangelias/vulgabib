  "And the Festus said, 'Paulus, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad.'",
  "But he said, 'I am not amens, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of veritas and sobrietas.'",
  "For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner.'",
  "King Agrippa, believest thou the prophetas? I know that thou believest.'",
  "Then Agrippa said unto Paulus, 'Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christianus.'",
  "And Paulus said, 'I would to Deus that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these vincula.'",
  "And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them:",
  "And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, 'This man doeth nothing worthy of morte or vincula.'",
  "Then said Agrippa unto Festus, 'This man might have been released, if he had not appealed unto Caesarus.'",
  "And when it was determined that we should sail into Italic, they delivered Paulus and certain other prisoners unto one named Julius, a centurion of Augusti cohortis.",
  "And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia; one Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.",
  "And the next day we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously entreated Paulus, and gave him libertas to go unto his amici to refresh himself.",
  "And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the venti were contrary.",
  "And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.",
  "And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italic; and he put us therein.",
  "And when we had sailed slowly many dies, and scarce were come over against Cnidus, the ventus not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone;",
  "And, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called The fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea.",
  "Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fastus was now already past, Paulus admonished them,",
  "And said unto them, 'Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.'",
  "Nevertheless the centurion believed the governor and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paulus.",
  "And because the haven was not commodus to winter in, the more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice, and there to winter; which is an haven of Crete, and lieth toward the southwest and northwest.",
  "And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, loosing thence, they sailed close by Crete.",
  "But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon.",
  "And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let her drive.",
  "And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat:",
  "Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksand, strake sail, and so were driven.",
  "And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day they lightened the ship;",
  "And the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship.",
  "And when neither sun nor stellae in many dies appeared, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away.",
  "But after long abstinence Paulus stood forth in the midst of them, and said, 'Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss.'",
  "And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you, but of the ship.",
  "For there stood by me this night the angelus of Deus, whose I am, and whom I serve,",
  "Saying, 'Fear not, Paulus; thou must be brought before Caesarus: and, lo, Deus hath given thee all them that sail with thee.'",
  "Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: For I believe Deus, that it shall be even so as it was told me.",
  "Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.",
  "But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country;",
  "And sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it fifteen fathoms.",
  "Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.",
  "And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,",
  "Paulus said to the centurion and to the soldiers, 'Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.'",
  "Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.",
  "And while the day was coming on, Paulus besought them all to take meat, saying, 'This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried for, and continued fasting, having taken nothing.'",
  "Wherefore I pray you to take some meat: for this is for your salus: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you.'",
  "And when he thus spake, he took panem, and gave thanks to Deus in the presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to eat.",
  "Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some meat.",
  "And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.",
  "And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea.",
  "And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship.",
  "And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore.",
  "And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves.",
  "And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape.",
  "But the centurion, willing to save Paulus, kept them from their purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea, and get to land:",
  "And the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land.",
  "And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita."
