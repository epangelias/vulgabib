                    <p>And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 'Vox Domini dixit ad Mosen, dicendo' Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When any man hath a fluxus, or running seminis, his fluxus is unclean.</p>
<p>The woman also with whom man shall coire, shall be immunda, until the evening, and afterwards she shall be munda.</p>
<p>Every bed whereon he lieth that hath fluxum, is immundus: and every thing whereon he sitteth, shall be immundum.</p>
<p>And whosoever toucheth his bed, shall be immundus until the evening, and he that beareth the bed, and the man that lieth on the bed, shall wash his vestes, and be immundus until the evening.</p>
<p>And whomsoever he that hath fluxum toucheth, without having manus to abstergeo, shall be immundus until the evening, and he shall lauo manus suas.</p>
<p>And the vas which he toucheth that hath fluxus, shall be ruptum, and every vas of lignum shall be lauandum with aqua.</p>
<p>If the man that hath fluxus be mundus, then he shall numerare septem dies postquam mundus erat.</p>
<p>And on the eighth dies he shall lauo two turtles or two columbas to the porta of the Tabernaculum of the testimony, and shall dare ea in munus to the sacerdos.</p>
<p>And the sacerdos shall facere ea in pro mundi munus before the Domini to expiare the mundum who had the fluxum.</p>
