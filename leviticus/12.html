                    <p>1 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 2 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a woman have conceived seed, and born a masculus, then she shall be impura septem dies; according to the dies of the separation for her infirmitas shall she be impura.</p>
<p>3 And in the octavo die the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcisus.</p>
<p>4 And she shall then continue in the sanguis of her purgation thirty tres dies; she shall touch no sanctum thing, nor come into the sanctuarium, until the dies of her purgation be fulfilled.</p>
<p>5 But if she bear a foemina, then she shall be impura duodecim dies, according to the dies of her separation, and sixty sex dies for the sanguis of her purgation.</p>
<p>6 And when the dies of her purgation are fulfilled, for a filius, or for a filia, she shall bring a agnus of the first year for a holocaustum, and a young columba, or a turtur, for a peccatum, unto the door of the tabernaculum of the congregation, unto the sacerdos:</p>
<p>7 Who shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, and make an atonement for her before the Lord, and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her sanguis. Thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their impuritas; that they die not in their impuritas, when they defile my tabernaculum that is among them.</p>
<p>8 And this is the law for her that hath born a masculus, or a foemina.</p>
<p>9 And if she be not able to bring a agnus, then she shall bring two turtures, or two young columbae; the one for the burnt offering, and the other for a sin offering: and the sacerdos shall make an atonement for her, and she shall be clean.</p>
