                    <p>1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 2 Speak unto Aaron, and unto his filii, that they separate themselves from the sanctuaria of the filii Israel, and that they profane not my nomine sanctum in those things which they consecrate unto me: I am the LORD.</p>
<p>3 Say unto them, Whosoever he be of all your semina, that approcheth unto the sanctuaria of the LORD, whilst he hath impuritas upon him, that anima shall be exterminata from my sight: I am the LORD.</p>
<p>4 Whatsoever anima of the semina of Aaron hath leprosam, or hath fluxus seminis, he shall not eat of the sanctuaria, until he be mundus. And he that toucheth any thing that hath been polluted with mortuum, or a homo that hath had coitus with him.</p>
<p>5 Or a homo whose semen goeth from him, so that he is not mundus; and he that toucheth any reptile, whereby he may be polluti; 6 or a homo that toucheth any homo that is pollutus with impuritas.</p>
<p>7 The anima which shall eat of any such shall be polluti until the vespere, and shall not eat of the sanctuaria, unless he hath lavatus his corpus in aqua.</p>
<p>8 And the sacerdos that offereth it for the peccatum, shall eat it in the locus sanctus: in the atrium of the tabernaculi of the conventionis it shall be eaten, and its sanguis shall be sparsio about the altare.</p>
<p>9 And no portion of it shall be eaten raw, or sodden in aqua, but roast with ignis; the caput with the pedes, and with the interiora thereof.</p>
<p>10 For whosoever eateth of the sanguis of the bestiam, in quocumque loco, he shall be exterminata from his populus.</p>
<p>11 For the anima of the carnem is in the sanguis, and I have given it to you upon the altare to make expiatio for your animas: for it is the sanguis that maketh expiatio for the anima.</p>
<p>12 Therefore I said unto the filii Israel, No anima of you shall eat sanguis, neither shall any peregrinus that peregrinatur among you eat sanguis.</p>
<p>13 And what homo soever of the filii Israel, or of the peregrini that peregrinatur among you, which shall venari and take any bestiam or avis, that may be eaten, he shall effund the sanguis thereof, and operiet it with terra.</p>
<p>14 For it is the anima of all carnem; the sanguis of it is for the anima thereof: therefore I said unto the filii Israel, Ye shall eat the sanguis of no carnem: for the anima of all carnem is the sanguis thereof: whosoever eateth it shall be exterminata.</p>
<p>15 And every anima that eateth that which dieth of itself, or that which is mortuum by the ferrum of beasts, whether it be among his own civis, or a peregrinus, he shall lavare his vestes, and abluere himself in aqua, and be pollutus until the vespere: then shall he be mundus.</p>
<p>16 But if he lavare not himself, nor abluere his corpus, then he shall bear his iniquitas.</p>
