                    <p>Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, doth he not see my 'malum' (evil), and how long shall they vex my soul?</p>
<p>They pull me out of the way, and 'assurgunt' (rise up) against me, and they have laid 'insidias' (snares) for my soul.</p>
<p>Others have 'rapinam' (rapine) in their families, and the sword is in their dwelling, because of 'malum' (evil) they have not feared.</p>
<p>Their 'vires' (oxen) are fat, they 'pascent' (graze) in a land of plenty, and they have 'libenter' (willingly) drunk of the torrent of its 'rivus' (brook).</p>
<p>And it is certain that the 'vox' (voice) of the 'miser' (wretched) shall not be heard, neither shall the arm of the 'debilis' (weak) be lifted up.</p>
<p>Others have been with the 'angelus' (messenger) of 'malum' (evil), and have not 'salvus' (escaped) by the 'manus' (hand) of the 'tenebrae' (darkness).</p>
<p>The 'pes' (foot) of the 'pauper' (poor) shall not have 'requies' (rest), nor shall the 'manus' (hand) of the 'miser' (wretched) be lifted up.</p>
<p>They have 'suscitaverunt' (stirred up) the 'bellum' (war) against the 'unicornis' (unicorn), and have 'suscitaverunt' (stirred up) the 'cornu' (horn) of the 'rhinoceros'.</p>
<p>They have 'vexaverunt' (vexed) the 'siccitas' (dryness) of the 'terra' (earth), and have not given 'aquas' (waters) to the 'sitienti' (thirsty).</p>
<p>They have 'suscitaverunt' (stirred up) the 'fames' (hunger) and the 'siccitas' (dryness) of the 'terra' (earth), and have not 'dederunt' (given) 'panem' (bread) to the 'esurienti' (hungry).</p>
<p>They have 'rapuerunt' (snatched away) the 'spolia' (spoils) of the 'pauper' (poor) and the 'vestimenta' (garments) of the 'nudus' (naked),</p>
<p>They have 'vexaverunt' (vexed) the 'infelix' (unhappy) and the 'miser' (wretched), and have not 'dederunt' (given) 'requies' (rest) to the 'lassus' (weary).</p>
<p>The 'ira' (wrath) of the 'Deus' (God) shall 'emerget' (emerge) against them, and shall not 'dimittere' (dismiss) the 'ira' (wrath) of the 'inimicus' (enemy).</p>
<p>He shall 'persequi' (pursue) them, and shall 'vexare' (vex) them, even to the 'finis' (end) of the 'terra' (earth).</p>
<p>And he shall 'votare' (vow) against them, and shall 'implet' (fill) his 'manus' (hand) against them, and shall 'suscitare' (stir up) his 'ira' (wrath) against them.</p>
<p>The 'ira' (wrath) of the 'Deus' (God) shall 'emerget' (emerge) against them, and shall 'detrudere' (thrust) them into the 'tenebrae' (darkness), and into the 'umbra' (shadow) of 'malum' (evil).</p>
<p>He shall 'vexare' (vex) them in the 'nox' (night), and shall 'persequi' (pursue) them in the 'dies' (day), and shall 'suscitare' (stir up) his 'ira' (wrath) against them.</p>
<p>He shall 'votare' (vow) against them, and shall 'implet' (fill) his 'manus' (hand) against them, and shall 'detrudere' (thrust) them into the 'tenebrae' (darkness), and into the 'umbra' (shadow) of 'malum' (evil).</p>

<p>And he shall 'detrudere' (thrust) them into the 'tenebrae' (darkness), and into the 'umbra' (shadow) of 'malum' (evil), and shall 'votare' (vow) against them, and shall 'implet' (fill) his 'manus' (hand) against them.</p>
