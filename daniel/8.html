                    <p>In the third year of the reign of King Belshazzar, a vision appeared unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first.</p>
<p>Then I lifted up mine oculus, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the flumen Ulai a ram which had two cornua: and the two cornua were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.</p>
<p>I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no anima could stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his manus: he did according to his voluntas, and became magnus.</p>
<p>As I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole terra, and touched not the terra: and the goat had a notable hornus between his oculi.</p>
<p>And he came to the ram that had two cornua, which I had seen standing before the flumen, and ran unto him in the furor of his potentia.</p>
<p>And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two cornua: and there was no potentia in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the terra, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his manus.</p>
<p>Therefore the he goat waxed very magnus: and when he was strong, the great hornus was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four venti of the coelum.</p>
<p>And out of one of them came forth a little cornu, which waxed exceeding magnus, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant land.</p>
<p>And it waxed magnus, even to the exercitus of the coelum; and it cast down some of the stellae to the terra, and stamped upon them.</p>
<p>Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the exercitus; and by him the daily sacrificium was taken away, and the locus of his sanctuarium was cast down.</p>
<p>And an host was given him against the daily sacrificium by reason of transgressio, and it cast down the veritas to the terra; and it practised, and prospered.</p>
<p>Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain saint which spake, How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrificium, and the transgressio of desolation, to give both the sanctuarium and the host to be trodden under foot?</p>
<p>And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuarium be cleansed.</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, and sought for the significatio, that, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a vir.</p>
<p>And I heard a vir's vox between the banks of the Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.</p>
<p>So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my facies: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end shall be the vision.</p>
<p>Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep somnus on my facies toward the terra: but he touched me, and set me upright.</p>
<p>And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignatio: for at the time appointed the end shall be.</p>
<p>The ram which thou sawest having two cornua are the kings of Media and Persia.</p>
<p>And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great hornus that is between his oculi is the first king.</p>
<p>Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his potentia.</p>
<p>And in the latter time of their regnum, when the transgressores are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.</p>
<p>And his potentia shall be mighty, but not by his own potentia: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practise, and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people.</p>
<p>And through his politia also he shall cause craft to prosper in his manus; and he shall magnify himself in his cor: and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without manus.</p>
<p>And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is true: wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it shall be for many dies.</p>
<p>And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain dies; afterward I rose up, and did the king's negotium; and I was astonished at the vision, but none understood it.</p>
