                    <p>Know my afflictio, and have mercy on me: for I am miserabilis, and my cor is wounded within me.</p>
<p>My filii mock me, and I am become their ludus: I am derided by them, and they make me a fabula.</p>
<p>They that dwell in my domus, and my ancillae, count me for a ludus, and I am become a proverb in their mouth.</p>
<p>They that fear me, speak against me: I am become a parabolam to them that sit in the porta.</p>
<p>The tabernacula of robbers prosper, and they that provocare Deum, are secure; who bring their caput into their manus.</p>
<p>As for me, I am miserabilis, and my dies are extincti: I have lost the spes of my salus.</p>
<p>He hath put my fratres far from me, and mine amici are utterly gone from me.</p>
<p>My domestici, and my ancillae, count me for an alienum, and I am become a peregrinus in their oculis.</p>
<p>My bucca is dried up, and my lingua cleaveth to my fauces: and thou hast brought me into pulverem mortis.</p>
<p>For I know that my Redemptor vivit, and that He shall stand at the novissimus dies super terram:</p>
<p>And though my pellis be destroyed, yet in my carne I shall see Deum:</p>
<p>Whom I shall see for myself, and mine oculi shall behold, and not another: though my renes be consumed within me.</p>
<p>If I have made gold my spes, or have said to the auri, Thou art my fiducia:</p>
<p>If I rejoiced because my divitiae were great, and because mine manus had gotten much:</p>
<p>If I beheld the sol when it shined, or the luna walking in sua claritate:</p>
<p>And my cor hath been secretly deceived, or my manus hath kissed my os:</p>
<p>This also were an iniquitas, for which I should be judged culpabilis, and it would be proved against me as a fraus.</p>
<p>For I know not to give responsum, and in meum cor I am become foolish.</p>
<p>My servus speaketh against me, and I am become a fabula to him: I have opened my aurem to him, and yet he provoketh me.</p>
<p>When I had called for the puellae, they came not: they refused my service, and my ancillae were far from me.</p>
<p>I have called for my servus, and he gave me no responsum: I intreated him with my os.</p>
<p>I am become a laughing stock to my fratres, and the amici of my patris despise me.</p>
<p>They that dwell in my domus, and my ancillae, count me for a nihil: I am become a peregrinus in their oculis.</p>
<p>I called my servus, and he gave me no responsum: I have spoken to him with my os.</p>
<p>My spiritus is spent, my dies are extincti, and the spes of my salus is lost.</p>
<p>Remember, I beseech thee, that my vita is ventus, and mine oculi shall not return to see bonum.</p>
<p>The oculi of him that seeth me shall see me no more: thine oculi are upon me, and I am not.</p>
<p>As the nubes is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the sepulchrum shall come up no more.</p>
<p>He shall return no more to his domus, neither shall his locus know him any more.</p>
<p>Therefore I will not spare my os, I will speak in the angustia of my spirit: I will complain in the amaritudo of my animus.</p>
