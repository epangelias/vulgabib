                    <p>A Song of degrees for Solomon. Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the Lord keep the civitas, the watchman waketh but in vain.</p>
<p>It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of dolores, for so giveth he his beloved sleep.</p>
<p>Lo, children are an hereditas of the Lord: and the fructus of the womb is his reward.</p>
<p>As arrows in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the iuventus.</p>
<p>Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with inimicis in the porta.</p>
<p>Except the Lord build the domus, they labour in vain that build it: except the Lord keep the civitas, the watchman waketh but in vain.</p>
<p>The Lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, and even for evermore.</p>
