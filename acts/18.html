                    <p>And after this Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;</p>
<p>And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, who lately came from Italia, with his uxor Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Iudaeos to depart from Roma) and came unto them.</p>
<p>And because he was of the same Ars, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentores.</p>
<p>And he reasoned in the synagoga every sabbath, and persuaded the Iudaeos and the Graecos.</p>
<p>And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in spirit, and testified to the Iudaeos that Iesus was Christus.</p>
<p>And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his vestimenta, and said unto them, Your sanguis be upon your caput; I am mundus: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles.</p>
<p>And he departed thence, and entered into the domus of a certain man named Iustus, one that worshipped Deum, whose domus joined hard to the synagoga.</p>
<p>And Crispus, the ruler of the synagoga, believed in Domino with all his domus: and many of the Corinthii hearing believed, and were baptized.</p>
<p>Then spake the Dominus to Paul in the nocte by a visio, Have no timor, but speak, and hold not thy lingua:</p>
<p>For I am with thee, and no man shall set upon thee to hurt thee: for I have much populus in this civitas.</p>
<p>And he continued there a year and six menses, teaching the verbum Dei among them.</p>
<p>And when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Iudaeos made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the iudicium,</p>
<p>Saying, This fellow persuadeth men to worship Deum contrary to the legem.</p>
<p>And when Paul was now about to open his os, Gallio said unto the Iudaeos, If it were a iusdictio of wrong or wicked malum, O ye Iudaeos, reason would that I should bear with you:</p>
<p>But if it be a quaestio of verbum and nominis, and of your lex, look ye to it; for I will be no iudex of such matters.</p>
<p>And he drave them from the iudicium.</p>
<p>And all the Graeci took Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagoga, and beat him before the iudicium. And Gallio cared for none of those things.</p>
<p>And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the fratres, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his caput in Cencreae: for he had a votum.</p>
<p>And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagoga, and reasoned with the Iudaeos.</p>
<p>When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he consented not;</p>
<p>But bade them adieu, saying, I must by all means keep this festum that cometh in Hierusalem: but I will return again unto you, if Deus will. And he sailed from Ephesus.</p>
<p>And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the ecclesia, he went down to Antiochia.</p>
<p>And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the discipuli.</p>
