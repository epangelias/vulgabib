  "Now these are the nations which the Deus did not destroy, because the filii Israel did not obtain their terminus of possession, that the Deus might tempt Israel withal, whether they would harken unto the praecepta of the Deus, which he commanded their patres.",
  "The nations are these, the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Jebusite, the Hivite, and the Amorite, five reges of the Philistines, the Canaanite, and the Sidonian, and the Hivite that dwelt in mount Libanus, from mount Baalhermon unto the entering in of Hamath.",
  "These did the Deus leave, to prove Israel by them, even as many of Israel as had not known all the bella of Canaan; only that the posteritas of the filii Israel might know, to teach them war, at least such as before knew nothing thereof;",
  "Namely, five reges of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Libanus, from mount Baalhermon unto the entering in of Hamath.",
  "And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would harken unto the praecepta of the Deus, which he commanded their patres by the manu of Moses.",
  "And the filii Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites: And they took their filiae to be their uxor, and gave their filiae to their filii, and served their deos.",
  "And the filii Israel did evil in the sight of the Deus, and forgot the Deus their Salvator, who had delivered them out of the manu of their inimici on every side;",
  "Therefore the Deus was angry with Israel, and he delivered them into the manu of Chushanrishathaim rex of Mesopotamia: and the filii Israel served Chushanrishathaim eight anni.",
  "When the filii Israel cried unto the Deus, the Deus raised up a salvator to the filii Israel, who saved them, even Othniel ben Kenaz, fratrem Caleb minor.",
  "And the spiritus of the Deus came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the Deus delivered Chushanrishathaim rex of Mesopotamia into his manu; and his manus prevailed against Chushanrishathaim.",
  "And the land had rest forty anni. And Othniel ben Kenaz died.",
  "And the filii Israel did evil again in the sight of the Deus: and the Deus strengthened Eglon rex of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the Deus.",
  "And he gathered unto him the filii of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the civitas of palm trees.",
  "So the filii Israel served Eglon rex of Moab eighteen anni.",
  "But when the filii Israel cried unto the Deus, the Deus raised them up a salvator, Ehud ben Gera, a man of the tribus of Benjamin, a man who was not dexter with his manus.",
  "And by him the filii Israel sent a donarium unto Eglon rex of Moab.",
  "Now Ehud was a man qui erat naturae sinistrae, and he made him a gladius of two edges, of the length of the palma of the manus, and he did hide it under his vestimenta upon his dexter coxa.",
  "And he brought the donarium unto Eglon rex of Moab: and Eglon was a homo crassus and grossus.",
  "And when he had killed the filii of the reges of Moab, he sent them away, and they fled.",
  "Now when he had sent away the donarium, he sent away also the populus who bare the donarium.",
  "But he himself turned again from the idola that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a sermonem of Deus unto thee, O rex. And he said, Silence. And he put forth the custodes who stood before him, and said, Go not forth; for the sermonem is of Deus.",
  "And Ehud said, I have a verbum of Deus unto thee, O rex of Moab. He arose out of his sede, and Ehud put forth his manus dextram, and took the gladius from his dexter coxa, and thrust it into his ventrem:",
  "And the copia of the gladius came out behind him, and the mors went in, and the sterquilinium came out.",
  "And they said, There is a man come hither to slay the rex, and he hath shut the ostia of the cenacula, and hath bolted them.",
  "And they tarried till they were confusus, and, behold, he opened not the ostia of the cenacula; therefore they took a clavem, and opened them, and, behold, their dominus was fallen to the terra dead.",
  "And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the idola and the places of refugium, and came to Seirah.",
  "And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a bucina in mount Ephraim, and the filii Israel went down with him from the montes, and he before them.",
  "And he said unto them, Follow me: for the Deus hath delivered your inimicos the Moabites into your manus. And they went down after him, and took the vada of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over.",
  "And they smote of Moab at that time about ten thousand viri, all robusti and valentes; and there escaped not a man.",
  "So Moab was subdued that day under the manus of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore anni.",
  "After him was Shamgar ben Anath, who smote of the Philistines six hundred viri with an aratrum of boues, and he also saved Israel."
