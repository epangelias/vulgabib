  "Now we beseech you, brethren, by the adventus of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our congregatio unto him,",
  "That ye be not soon shaken in mente, nor be troubled neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by epistula as from us, as that the day of the Lord is at hand;",
  "Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a defectio first, and that homo peccati be revealed, the filius perditionis;",
  "Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called Deus, or that is worshipped; so that he as Deus sitteth in the templum of Deus, shewing himself that he is Deus.",
  "Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?",
  "And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his tempus.",
  "For the mysterium of iniquitas doth already work: only he who now letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way.",
  "And then shall that homo peccati be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his adventus:",
  "Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,",
  "And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the veritas, that they might be saved.",
  "And for this cause God shall send them strong delusio, that they should believe a lie:",
  "That they all might be damned who believed not the veritas, but had pleasure in unrighteousness."
