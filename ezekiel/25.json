  "1 And there is a word of the Lord unto me, saying, 2 Filii Ammon, shall I not visit you for this, saith Dominus, because ye have polluted sanctuarium meum, and ye have led my sanctuarium into ignominiam, and ye have polluted the terram Israel?",
  "3 Therefore thus saith Dominus Deus, Ecce, ego extendam manum meam super te, and will deliver thee for spolia gentibus, and will excidam te e gentibus, and will perdere de terris, and dispergam te in montibus,",
  "4 And I will make thy civitatem a solitude, and thy terram desertam, and thou shalt know that I am Dominus.",
  "5 Because thou hast said, Ha! the domus Iudae is destroyed, therefore I will deliver thee for spolia filiis orientis.",
  "6 Therefore thus saith Dominus Deus, Because thou hast clapped manus tuae, and stamped pedem tuum, and hast delighted in terra Israel with toto corde tuo,",
  "7 Therefore behold, I will extend manum meam upon thee, and will deliver thee for spolia gentibus, and will excidam te e gentibus, and will perdere de terris, and dispergam te in montibus,",
  "8 Thou shalt die by interitum gladii, because Dominus dixit ita.",
  "9 And I will give terram tuam in hereditatem, and will make thee a solitude, and thou shalt know that I am Dominus.",
  "10 Because thou hast said, Ha! the duae domus Israel, and the domus Iudae is destroyed, therefore ego sum Rex, and I will dwell in the medio terrae.",
  "11 Therefore thus saith Dominus Deus, Because thou hast extended manum tuam upon terram Israel, and hast polluted sanctuarium meum, and hast led my sanctuarium into ignominiam,",
  "12 Therefore thus saith Dominus Deus, I will also deal with thee, O filii Ammon, and will visit thee with ignem, and will make thee in medio flammae, and will deliver thee in manus virorum robustorum, and potentium gentium,",
  "13 And thou shalt be a desolatio, and thy civitas a solitude, and thou shalt know that I am Dominus, because thou hast blasphemed sanctuarium meum.",
  "14 Thus saith Dominus Deus, When the domus Israel was in desolation, and herbes ejus erant combustae, tu eras in medio ejus, and hast delighted in terra ejus,",
  "15 Thou hast blasphemed montem Israel, and led eum in ignominiam, and hast led sanctuarium meum in desolationem, and thou hast delighted in terra ejus,",
  "16 Therefore thus saith Dominus Deus, Because thou hast led sanctuarium meum in desolationem, and hast delighted in terra ejus,",
