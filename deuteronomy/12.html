                    <p>These be the statutes and judicia, which ye shall observe to do in the terra, which the Lord God of thy patres giveth thee to possess it, as long as ye live upon the facies of the terra.</p>
<p>Destroy ye utterly all the loca, wherein the gentes which ye shall possess served their deos, upon the montes, and upon the colles, and under every arbor frondosus:</p>
<p>And ye shall destroy their altaria, and break down their statues, and burn their luci in ignem, and ye shall hew down the imagines of their deos, and destroy the nomina of them out of that locus.</p>
<p>Ye shall not do so unto the Lord your Deus, but the locus which the Lord your Deus shall choose out of all your tribus to put his nomine there, even unto his habitaculum shall ye seek, and thither thou shalt come:</p>
<p>And thither ye shall bring your holocausta, and your victims, and your decimas, and the separation of your manus, and your vota, and your spontanea munera, and the primogenita of your armenta, and of your pecudes:</p>
<p>And there ye shall eat before the faciem of the Lord your Deus, and ye shall rejoice in all the outflowing of your manus, ye and your domus, wherein the Lord thy Deus hath blessed thee.</p>
<p>Ye shall not eat in your portis the decimas of your frumenti, and of your musti, and of thy olei, nor the primogenita of thy armenta, nor of thy pecudes, nor any of thy vota which thou hast vowed, nor thy spontanea munera, nor the separation of thy manus:</p>
<p>But in the loco which the Lord thy Deus shall choose to make his nomine dwell there, thou shalt eat them before the faciem of the Lord thy Deus, thou, and thy filius, and thy filia, and thy servus, and thy ancilla, and the Levites who is in thy portis, and the peregrinus, and the pupillus, and the vidua, who are in the medio of thee, that the Lord thy Deus may bless thee in all the outflowing of thy manus, wherewith thou shalt work.</p>
<p>When the Lord thy Deus shall have enlarged thy terminus, as he hath spoken, and thou shalt say, I will eat carne, because thy animus longeth to eat carne, thou shalt eat carne according to all the desiderium of thy animus.</p>
<p>When the locus which the Lord thy Deus shall choose to put his nomine there is far from thee, then thou shalt kill of thy armenta, and of thy pecudes, which the Lord hath given thee, as I have commanded thee, and thou shalt eat in thy portis, according to all the desiderium of thy animus.</p>
<p>Even as the cervina, and the caprea, thou shalt eat them, the mundus, and the immundus, shall eat of them together.</p>
<p>Only be firm, that thou eat not of the sanguis, for thou shalt pour out the sanguis thereof upon the terra, as aqua.</p>
<p>Thou shalt not eat it in thy portis, that it may be well with thee, and with thy filiis after thee, when thou shalt do that which is rectum in the oculis of the Lord.</p>
<p>When the Lord thy Deus shall have destroyed the gentes, whose terra the Lord thy Deus giveth thee, thou shalt destroy them utterly, nor shalt thou make pactiones with them, nor have misericordia upon them:</p>
<p>Neither shalt thou intermarry with them, nor give thy filiam to his filius, nor take his filiam to thy filius.</p>
<p>For he will turn away thy filius from following me, that they may serve other deos, and the ira of the Lord will be inflamed against you, and ye shall perish soon.</p>
<p>But thus shall ye deal with them, ye shall destroy their altaria, and break down their statues, and cut down their luci, and burn their imagines in ignem, and ye shall root out their nomina out of that locus.</p>
<p>Thou shalt not do so unto the Lord thy Deus, but thou shalt seek the locus which the Lord thy Deus shall choose out of all thy tribus, to put his nomine there, and thou shalt come thither, and thither thou shalt bring thy holocausta, and thy victims, and thy decimas, and the separation of thy manus, and thy vota, and thy spontanea munera:</p>
<p>And thou shalt rejoice before the faciem of the Lord thy Deus, thou, and thy filius, and thy filia, and thy servus, and thy ancilla, and the Levites who is in thy portis, and the peregrinus, and the pupillus, and the vidua, who are in the medio of thee.</p>
<p>And thou shalt remember that thou wast a servus in Aegypto, and thou shalt observe and do these statuta.</p>
<p>Thou shalt not offer the passover in any of the portis of thy tribus which the Lord thy Deus giveth thee:</p>
<p>But in the loco which the Lord thy Deus shall choose to put his nomine there, thou shalt offer the passover at vesper, at the setting of the sol, at the hora that thou camest out of Aegypto.</p>
<p>And thou shalt cook and eat it in the loco which the Lord thy Deus shall choose, and in the mane thou shalt turn and go unto thy tabernacula.</p>
<p>Six dies thou shalt eat unleavened panis, and the septimus dies shall be a solemnitas unto the Lord thy Deus, thou shalt do no opus in it.</p>
<p>Seventh dies shall be a solemnitas unto the Lord thy Deus, thou shalt do no opus in it, nor thy filius, nor thy filia, nor thy servus, nor thy ancilla, nor thy bubalus, nor thy asinus, nor any of thy pecudes, nor the peregrinus who is in the medio of thee:</p>
<p>That thy servus, and thy ancilla may rest, as well as thou, and thou shalt remember that thou wast a servus in Aegypto, and the Lord thy Deus brought thee out thence by a manu forte, and by a brachium stretched out, therefore the Lord thy Deus commanded thee to make the diem of sabbatum.</p>
