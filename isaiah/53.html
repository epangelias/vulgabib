                    <p>Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?</p>
<p>For he shall grow up before him as a planta, and as a radix out of a terra seca: he hath no forma nor species: and when we shall see him, there is no species that we should desiderare him.</p>
<p>He is despised and rejected of homines: a homo dolorum, and acquainted with infirmitas: and we hid as it were our facies from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.</p>
<p>Surely he hath portare our infirmitas, and carre our dolores: yet we did aestimare him as a homo plagatus of Deus, and afflictus.</p>
<p>But he was vulneratus for our iniquitates: the castigatio of our pacem was upon him; and with his livor we are sanati.</p>
<p>All we like oves erravimus; we have turned every one to his own via: and the Lord hath posuit in him the iniquitas of us all.</p>
<p>He was oppressus, and he was afflictus, yet he did not aperire his os: he is led as a agnus to the mactatio, and as a ovis before her tondentes, is mutus, so he did not aperire his os.</p>
<p>In his humiliation his judicium was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his vita is taken away from the terra: and for the scelus of my populus was he vulneratus.</p>
<p>And he made his sepulchrum with the wickedus, and with dives in his morte; because he had not done scelus, neither was dolus in his os.</p>
<p>Yet it pleased the Lord to vulnerare him; he hath put him in infirmitas: when thou shalt make his anima an oblatio for peccatum, he shall see semen, he shall prolong his dies, and the voluntas of the Lord shall prosper in his manu.</p>
<p>He shall see of the labor of his anima, and shall be satisfied: by his scientia shall my justus servus justify many; for he shall portare their iniquitates.</p>
<p>Therefore will I divide him a portion with the magni, and he shall divide the spolia with the fortes; because he hath portare the peccata of many, and made intercessio for the transgressores.</p>
