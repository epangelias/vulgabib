                    <p>I say then, Hath Deus cast away his people? Deus forbid. For I also am Israelita, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.</p>
<p>Deus hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the Scriptura saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to Deus against Israel, saying,</p>
<p>Domine, they have killed thy prophetas, and digged down thine altaria; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.</p>
<p>But what saith the responsio of Deus unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand homines, who have not bowed knee to Baal.</p>
<p>Even so then at this present time also, there is a remnant according to the electio gratiae.</p>
<p>And if by gratia, then is it no more ex operibus: otherwise gratia is no more gratia. But if it be ex operibus, then is it no more gratia: otherwise work is no more work.</p>
<p>What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the electio hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded</p>
<p>According as it is written, Deus hath given them the spiritus stuporis, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear; unto this day.</p>
<p>And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a retributio unto them:</p>
<p>Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway.</p>
<p>I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? Deus forbid: but rather through their fall, salvus is come unto the gentes, for to provoke them to zelus.</p>
<p>Now if the fall of them be the riches of the mundus, and the diminutio of them the riches of the gentes; how much more their plenitudo?</p>
<p>For I speak to you gentes, inasmuch as I am the apostolus of the gentes, I magnify mine officium:</p>
<p>If by any means I may provoke to zelus mine own carnem, and might save some of them.</p>
<p>For if the firstfruits be sanctus, the lump is also: and if the radix be sanctus, so are the rami.</p>
<p>Because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by fide. Be not highminded, but fear:</p>
<p>For if Deus spared not the naturalem ramos, take heed lest he also spare not thee.</p>
<p>Behold therefore the benignitas of Deus and severitas: on them which fell, severitas; but toward thee, benignitas, if thou continue in his benignitas: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.</p>
<p>And they also, if they abide not still in incredulitas, shall be graffed in: for Deus is potent to graff them in again.</p>
<p>For if thou wert cut out of the oliva which is wild by natura, and wert graffed contrary to natura into a good oliva: how much more shall these, which be the naturalem rami, be graffed into their own oliva?</p>
<p>For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mysterium, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the plenitudo of the gentes be come in,</p>
<p>And so all Israel shall be salvus: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:</p>
<p>For this is my testament unto them: when I shall take away their peccata.</p>
<p>As concerning the Evangelium, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the electio, they are beloved for the patres' sakes.</p>
<p>For the dona and the vocatio of Deus are without paenitentia.</p>
<p>For as ye in times past were disobedientes to Deus, but now have obtained misericordiam through their disobedientia:</p>
<p>Even so have these also now been disobedientes; that through your misericordiam they also may obtain misericordiam.</p>
<p>For Deus hath concluded them all in incredulitas, that he might have misericordiam upon all.</p>
<p>O the profunditas of the divitiarum of the sapientia and scientia of Deus! how unsearchable are his judicia, and his viae past finding out!</p>
<p>For who hath known the mens of Domine? or who hath been his consiliarius?</p>
<p>Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?</p>
<p>For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be gloria in sempiternum. Amen.</p>
