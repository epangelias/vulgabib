  "And in that day thou shalt say, O Domine, I will praise thee: though thou wast angry with me, thine ira is turned away, and thou comfortedst me.",
  "Behold, Deus is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for the Domine Deus is my fortitudo and my canticum; he also is become my salvus.",
  "Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the fontes of salvus.",
  "And in that day shall ye say, Praise the Domine, call upon his nomine, declare his opera among the people, make mention that his nomine is exalted.",
  "Sing unto the Domine; for he hath done excellentia: this is known in all the terra.",
  "Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Sion: for great is the Sanctus in the midst of thee; he is the Sanctus of Israel."
