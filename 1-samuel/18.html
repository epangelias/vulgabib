                    <p>And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the animus of Jonathan was knit with the animus of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own animus.</p>
<p>And Saul took him that day, and would not let him return to his domus.</p>
<p>Then Jonathan and David made a pactum, because he loved him as his own animus.</p>
<p>And Jonathan stripped himself of the tunic that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his vestes, even to his gladius, and to his arcus, and to his cinctus.</p>
<p>And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, and behaved himself wisely: and Saul set him over the milites, and he was accepted in the sight of all the populus, and also in the sight of Saul's servientes.</p>
<p>And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistin, that the mulieres came out of all the urbes of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet King Saul, with tympana, with laetitia, and with citharas.</p>
<p>And the mulieres sang as they played, and said, Saul hath slain his mille, and David his decem milia.</p>
<p>And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed unto David decem milia, and to me they have ascribed but mille, and what can he have more but the regnum?</p>
<p>And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.</p>
<p>And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from Deus came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of his domus: and David played with his manus, as at other times: and there was a lance in Saul's manus.</p>
<p>And Saul cast the lance; for he said, I will smite David even to the paries with it. And David avoided out of his presence twice.</p>
<p>And Saul was afraid of David, because Deus was with him, and was departed from Saul.</p>
<p>Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his tribunus over a mille; and he went out and came in before the populus.</p>
<p>And David behaved himself wisely in all his vias; and Deus was with him.</p>
<p>Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was afraid of him.</p>
<p>But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came in before them.</p>
<p>And it came to pass after this, that there was again a pugna with the Philistin: and David went and fought with the Philistin, and slew them, and they fled from him.</p>
<p>And the evil spirit from Deus was upon Saul, as he sat in his domus with his lance in his manus, and David played with his manus.</p>
<p>And Saul sought to smite David even to the paries with the lance; but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, and he smote the lance into the paries: and David fled, and escaped that nocte.</p>
<p>And Saul sent messengers unto David's domus, to watch him, and to slay him in the mane.</p>
<p>But Michal David's uxor told him, saying, If thou save not thy animus to nocte, to morrow thou shalt be slain.</p>
<p>So Michal let David down through a fenestra: and he went, and fled, and escaped.</p>
<p>And Michal took an effigiem, and laid it in the lectus, and put a pellis of goats' hair for his caput, and covered it with a vestis.</p>
<p>And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is languid.</p>
<p>And Saul sent the messengers again to see David, saying, Bring him up to me in the lectus, that he may be slain.</p>
<p>And when the messengers were come in, behold, there was an effigiem in the lectus, with a pellis of goats' hair for his capus, and a vestis upon it.</p>
<p>And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, and sent away mine inimicus, that he is escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He said unto me, Let me go; why should I slay thee?</p>
<p>So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth.</p>
<p>And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.</p>
<p>And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophetae prophesying, and Samuel standing as prince over them, the Spiritus of Deus was upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.</p>
<p>And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they prophesied also.</p>
<p>Then went he also to Ramah, and came to a great well that is in Sechu: and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David? And one said, Behold, they be at Naioth in Ramah.</p>
<p>And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spiritus of Deus was upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.</p>
<p>And he stripped off his vestes also, and prophesied before Samuel, and lay down nudo all that day and all that nocte. Wherefore they say, Is Saul also among the prophetae?</p>
