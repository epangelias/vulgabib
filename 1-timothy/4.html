                    <p>I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Iesus Christ, who shall iudge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom; Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longanimitas and doctrine.</p>
<p>I charge thee therefore before Deus, and the Dominus Iesus Christ, who shall iudge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom; Preach the verbum; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longanimitas and doctrina.</p>
<p>For the time will come when they will not endure sana doctrina; but after their own cupiditas shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching auriculae; And they shall turn away their aures from veritas, and shall be turned unto fabulae.</p>
<p>Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the posteriora temporum some shall depart from the fides, giving heed to seducing spiritus and doctrinis dæmoniorum; Speaking lies in hypocricy; having their conscientiam cauterized with a hot iron;</p>
<p>Through the hypocricy of them that speak lies, and have their conscientiam cauterized with a hot iron; forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from escæ that God hath created to be received with gratiarum actione of them which believe and know the veritas.</p>
<p>If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Iesus Christ, nourished up in the words of fides and of bona doctrina, which thou hast followed.</p>
<p>But refuse profane and old wives' fabulae, and exercise thyself rather unto pietas; For bodily exercitation profiteth little: but pietas is profitable unto all things, having promissio of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.</p>
<p>This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptatio; For therefore we labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living Deus, who is the Salvator of all men, specially of those that believe.</p>
<p>These things command and teach. Let no man despise thy iuventutem; but be thou an example of the fideles in word, in conversation, in caritate, in spirit, in fide, in puritate.</p>
<p>Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrina; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.</p>
