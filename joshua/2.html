                    <p>And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to espiare, to view, and to explorare the land of Canaan, and the citadel of Jericho. And they went, and came unto a meretrix, a woman of Jericho, named Rahab, and lodged there.</p>
<p>And it was told the rector, the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men in hither to night of the filii Israel to explorare the terra, the land.</p>
<p>And the rector of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the viros, the men that are entered into thy domus, for they be venuti to explorare the terra, the land.</p>
<p>And the mulier, the woman took the duo viros, and hid them, and said thus, There came viros unto me, but I wist not whence they were:</p>
<p>And it came to pass about the tempus of shutting of the porta, when it was vesper, the viros went out: whither the viros went I wot not: pursue you after them quickly; for ye shall them apprehendare.</p>
<p>But she had brought them up to the tectum of her domus, and hid them with the linthea, the flax which she had laid in order upon the tectum.</p>
<p>And the viros pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the vada, the fords: and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out, they shut the porta, and the rector said unto the viros, Pursue after them quickly, and ye shall apprehendare them.</p>
<p>And it came to pass before they lay down, she came up unto them upon the tectum;</p>
<p>And she said unto the viros, I know that the Dominus hath given you the terram, the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all the incolae of the terra faint because of you.</p>
<p>For we have audire, heard how the Dominus dried up the aquas of the Red Sea for you, when ye came out of Aegyptum; and what ye did unto the duo reges of the Amorrhoei, that were beyond the Jordan, Sehon and Og, whom ye utterly destroyed.</p>
<p>And as soon as we had audire these words, our cor, heart failed, neither did there remain any spirit in any man, because of you: for the Dominus Deus is Deus in caelis above, and in terra beneath.</p>
<p>Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the Dominus, since I have dealt with you in misericordia, that ye will also deal with the domus of my pater in misericordia, and give me a signe, a token of veritas, that ye will save alive my pater, and my mater, and my fratres, and my sorores, and all that they have, and deliver our animae from morte.</p>
<p>And the viros said unto her, Our animae for your animae to die, if ye utter not this our verbum: and it shall be, when the Dominus hath given us the terram, that we will deal with thee in misericordia and veritas:</p>
<p>Then she let them down by a funiculus, a cord through the fenestra: for her domus was upon the murus of the civitas, and she dwelt upon the murus.</p>
<p>And she said unto them, Get you to the montem, lest the pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three dies, until the pursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your way.</p>
<p>And the viros said unto her, We will be blameless of this thy juramentum which thou hast made us swear.</p>
<p>Behold, when we come into the terra, thou shalt bind this funiculus, a cord of coccine, a scarlet thread in the fenestra which thou lettest us down by: and thou shalt bring thy pater, and thy mater, and thy fratres, and all thy domus to thee.</p>
<p>And it shall be, that whosoever shall issue out of the ostia of thy domus into the platea, his sanguis shall be upon his caput, and we will be immaculati: and whosoever shall be with thee in the domus, his sanguis shall be upon our caput, if any man lay hand upon him.</p>
<p>And if thou utter this our verbum, we will be quit of this thy juramentum which thou hast made us swear.</p>
<p>And she said, According unto your verbum, so be it. And she sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the funiculus, a cord of coccine in the fenestra.</p>
<p>And they went, and came unto the montem, and abode there three dies, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but found them not.</p>
<p>So the duo viros returned, and descended from the montem, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all things that befell them:</p>
