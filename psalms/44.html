                    <p>We have heard with our auris, O God, our patres have told us, what work thou didst in their dies, in the dies of old.</p>
<p>Thou didst drive out the gentes with thy manus, and plantedst our patres; thou didst afflict the gentes, and didst expellere them.</p>
<p>For they got not the terra in possession by their gladius, neither did their brachium save them: but thy dextera, and thine armum, and the lux of thy countenance; because thou hadst delight in them.</p>
<p>Thou art my Rex, O God: command salvus to Jacob.</p>
<p>Through thee will we push down our hostes: through thy nomine will we tread them under that rise up against us.</p>
<p>For I will not trust in my arcum, neither shall my gladius save me.</p>
<p>But thou hast saved us from our hostes, and hast confusus those that hated us.</p>
<p>In God we boast all the die, and praise thy nomine for ever. Selah.</p>
<p>But thou hast rejected us, and hast confusus us, and goest not forth with our exercitus.</p>
<p>Thou makest us to turne our back to our inimicus, and they that hate us, spolia us.</p>
<p>Thou hast given us like oves to be eaten, and hast dispersus us among the gentes.</p>
<p>Thou sellest thy populus for no pecunia, and hast not increased the pretium of them.</p>
<p>Thou makest us a reproach to our inimicus, a scorn and a derisus to them that are round about us.</p>
<p>Thou makest us a similitude among the gentes, a shaking of the caput among the populi.</p>
<p>My confusion is continually before me, and the ignominia of my facies hath covered me.</p>
<p>For the vox of him that reprehendeth and blasphemeth, by reason of the inimicus and persecutor.</p>
<p>All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsus in thy pactum.</p>
<p>Our cor is not turned back, neither have our pedes declined from thy via;</p>
<p>Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dracones, and coveredst us with the umbra of mortis.</p>
<p>If we have forgotten the nomine of our Deus, or stretched out our manus to a deus alienus;</p>
<p>Shall not Deus search this out? for he knoweth the secreta of the cor.</p>
<p>Yea, for thy causa we are killed all the die; we are counted as oves for the mactatio.</p>
<p>Awake, why sleepest thou, O Domine? arise, cast us not off for ever.</p>
<p>Wherefore hidest thou thy facies, and forgettest our afflictio and our oppressio?</p>
<p>For our anima is bowed down to the pulvis, our belly cleaveth to the terra.</p>
<p>Arise for our auxilium, and redime us for thy misericordia.</p>
