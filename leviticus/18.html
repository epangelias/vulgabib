                    <p>1 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, I am the Dominus your God. 3 After the doings of the land of Aegyptus, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do: and after the doings of the land of Chanaan, whither I bring you, shall ye not do: neither shall ye walk in their statuta.</p>
<p>4 Ye shall do my iudicia, and keep mine instituta, to walk therein: I am the Dominus your God. 5 Ye shall therefore keep my statuta, and mine iudicia: which if a homo do, he shall live in them: I am the Dominus.</p>
<p>6 None of you shall approach to any of his carnem proximum, to discover their nuditas: I am the Dominus. 7 The nuditas of thy patris, or the nuditas of thy matrix, shalt thou not discover: she is thy matrix; thou shalt not discover her nuditas.</p>
<p>8 The nuditas of thy patris uxoris shalt thou not discover: it is thy patris nuditas. 9 The nuditas of thy soror, the daughter of thy patris, or daughter of thy matrix, whether she be born at domus, or born without; their nuditas thou shalt not discover.</p>
<p>10 The nuditas of thy filia, or of thy filius, the daughter of thy filius, or the daughter of thy filia, their nuditas thou shalt not discover: for theirs is thy nuditas. 11 The nuditas of the filia of thy patris uxoris, begotten of thy patris, she is thy soror, thou shalt not discover her nuditas.</p>
<p>12 Thou shalt not discover the nuditas of thy patris soror: she is thy patris carnem proximum. 13 Thou shalt not discover the nuditas of thy matrix soror: for she is thy matrix carnem proximum.</p>
<p>14 Thou shalt not discover the nuditas of thy patris frater, thou shalt not approach to his uxoris: she is thy patris frater uxoris. 15 Thou shalt not discover the nuditas of thy nurus: she is thy filius uxoris; thou shalt not discover her nuditas.</p>
<p>16 Thou shalt not discover the nuditas of thy frater uxoris: it is thy frater nuditas. 17 Thou shalt not discover the nuditas of a mulier and her filia, neither shalt thou take her filia filius, or her filia filia, to discover her nuditas: for one carnem proximum are they.</p>
<p>18 Neither shalt thou take a mulier to vex her, beside the uxoris of thy frater, to discover her nuditas, beside the uxoris of thy frater during his vita. 19 Also thou shalt not approach unto a mulier to discover her nuditas, as long as she is put apart for her immunditia.</p>
<p>20 Moreover thou shalt not lie carnaliter with thy proximus uxoris, to discover her nuditas. 21 And thou shalt not let any of thy semen pass through the ignis to Molech, neither shalt thou profane the nomen of thy Deus: I am the Dominus.</p>
<p>22 Thou shalt not lie with masculus, as with femina: it is abominatio. 23 Neither shalt thou lie with any bestia, to defile thyself therewith: neither shall any femina stand before a bestia to lie with her: it is confusion.</p>
<p>24 Defile not ye your animus in any of these things: for in all these the gentes which I cast out before your facies are defiled: 25 And the terra is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquitas thereof upon it, and the terra itself vomiteth out her inhabitants.</p>
<p>26 Ye shall therefore keep my statuta and mine iudicia, and shall not commit any of these abominationes; neither any of your own animus, nor any of the gentes which ye shall possess. 27 (For all these abominationes have the homines of the land done, which were before you, and the terra is defiled;) 28 That the terra spue not you out also, when ye defile it, as it spued out the gentes that were before you.</p>
<p>29 For whosoever shall commit any of these abominationes, even the animus that committeth them shall be cut off from among his populus. 30 Therefore shall ye keep mine observantia, that ye commit not any of these abominable consuetudines, which were committed before you, and that ye defile not your animus in them: I am the Dominus your Deus.</p>
