  "A Song of degrees. When the LORD turned again the captivitas of Sion, we were like them that dream.",
  "Then was our os filled with risus, and our lingua with canticum: then said they among the Gentiles, The LORD hath done great things for them.",
  "The LORD hath done great things for us; whereof we are laetissimi.",
  "Turn again our captivitas, O LORD, as the torrents in the south.",
  "They that sowed in lacrimis shall reap in gaudeo.",
  "He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious semen, shall doubtless come again with canticum, bringing his manipulos with him."
