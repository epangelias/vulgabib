                    <p>And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place, and suddenly there came a sound from caelum, as of a rushing mighty ventus, and it filled all the domus where they were sitting.</p>
<p>And there appeared unto them divided linguae, as of ignis, and it sat upon each of them, and they were all filled with the Spiritus Sanctus, and began to speak with other linguae, as the Spiritus gave them utterance.</p>
<p>Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own lingua, and they were all admirati, and in dubio, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these qui loquuntur Galilaei?</p>
<p>And how hear we every man in our own lingua, wherein we were nati? Parthi, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Iudaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia, Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Aegyptus, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Roma, Iudaei also and proselyti, Cretes and Arabes, we do hear them speak in our own linguae the magnalia Dei.</p>
<p>And they were all admirati, and in dubio, saying one to another, What meaneth this? Others mocking said, These men are pleni vino novo.</p>
<p>But Petrus, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his vox, and said unto them, Ye men of Iudaea, and all ye that dwell at Hierosolyma, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words:</p>
<p>For these are not pleni vino, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the hora tertia, but this is that which was spoken by the propheta Ioel; And it shall come to pass in the novissimos dies, saith Deus, I will pour out of my Spiritus upon all flesh: and your filii and filiae shall prophesy, and your iuvenes shall see visiones, and your seniores shall dream somnia:</p>
<p>And on my servos, and on my ancillae, I will pour out in those dies of my Spiritus; and they shall prophesy: and I will shew prodigia in caelo above, and signa in terra beneath; sanguinem, and ignem, and vaporem fumi:</p>
<p>The sol shall be turned into tenebras, and the luna into sanguinem, before that great and notable dies of the Domini come: and it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall invocare the nomen Domini shall be salvus.</p>
<p>Ye men of Iudaea, and all ye that dwell at Hierosolyma, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words: for these are not pleni vino, as ye suppose, but this is that which was spoken by the propheta Ioel; And it shall come to pass in the novissimos dies, saith Deus, I will pour out of my Spiritus upon all flesh: and your filii and filiae shall prophesy, and your iuvenes shall see visiones, and your seniores shall dream somnia:</p>
<p>And on my servos, and on my ancillae, I will pour out in those dies of my Spiritus; and they shall prophesy: and I will shew prodigia in caelo above, and signa in terra beneath; sanguinem, and ignem, and vaporem fumi:</p>
<p>The sol shall be turned into tenebras, and the luna into sanguinem, before that great and notable dies of the Domini come: and it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall invocare the nomen Domini shall be salvus.</p>
<p>Ye men of Iudaea, hear these words: Iesum Nazarenus, a virum approved of Deus among you by virtus, and prodigiis, and signis, which Deus did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know:</p>
<p>Him, being delivered by the determinate consilium and praescientia of Deus, ye have taken, and by manus sceleratas crucifixus, and necavistis: whom Deus suscitavit, having loosed the dolores of mors, because it was not possible that he should be retentus by mors.</p>
<p>For David speaketh concerning him, I saw the Domini always before my facies, for he is on my dexteris manus, that I should not be moved:</p>
<p>Therefore did my cor agnoscere, and my lingua exsultare; moreover also my caro habitat in spem:</p>
<p>Because thou wilt not leave my animam in inferno, neither wilt thou permit the Sanctus tuus to see corruptio. Thou hast made known to me viae vitae; thou shalt make me full of gaudium with thy vultus.</p>
<p>Men and fratres, let me speak freely unto you of the patriarcha David, that he is both mortuus, and sepultus, and his sepulchrum is with us unto this day.</p>
<p>Therefore being a propheta, and knowing that Deus had sworn with an iuramentum to him, that of the fructus of his lumbi, according to the caro, he would raise up Christum to sit on his thronum;</p>
<p>He seeing this before spake of the resurrectio Christi, that his animam was not left in inferno, neither his caro did see corruptio.</p>
<p>This Iesus hath Deus suscitavit, whereof we are all testes.</p>
<p>Therefore being by the dexteram Dei exaltatus, and having received of the Patris the promissum Spiritum Sanctum, he hath poured forth this, which ye now see and hear.</p>
<p>For David is not ascensus in caelos: but he saith himself, The Domini said unto my Domini, Sit thou on my dexteram, until I make thy inimicos thy footstool.</p>
<p>Therefore let all the domus Israel cognoscere, that Deus hath made that same Iesum, whom ye have crucifixus, both Dominus and Christus.</p>
<p>Now when they heard this, they were prae cordiis, and said unto Petrum and the rest of the apostoli, Quid faciemus, fratres?</p>
<p>Then Petrus said unto them, Poenitentiam agite, and be baptized every one of you in the nomine Iesu Christi in remissionem peccatorum, and ye shall receive the donum Spiritus Sanctus.</p>
<p>For the promissio is unto you, and to your filiis, and to omni, who are far off, even as many as the Domini Deus shall vocare.</p>
<p>And with many other words did he testificari and exhortare, saying, Save yourselves from this generatio prava.</p>
<p>Then they that gladly received his verbum were baptized: and the same dies were added unto them about tria millia animae.</p>
<p>And they perseveraverunt in doctrina apostolorum, and communicatio, and fraction panis, and orationibus.</p>
<p>And omnis anima erat in admiratione, and magno gaudio; and dividere illis omnia, nec erat inter eos qui indigens esset: neque enim dicebant, Hoc aut illud est meum; sed erant illis omnia communia.</p>
<p>Et dabat illis Petrus, et reliqui apostoli, testimonium resurrectionis Domini Iesu Christi, et gratiam magnam erat in ipsis omnibus.</p>
