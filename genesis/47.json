  "47. Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren, and their flocke, and their carte, with all their substance, are come out of terra Chanaan; and behold, they are in terra Ramesse.",
  "And he took some of his fratres, five homines, and presented them unto Pharaoh.",
  "And Pharaoh said unto his fratres, What are your opera? And they said unto Pharaoh, We are pastors, Thy servos are shepherds, both we, and also our patres.",
  "They said moreover unto Pharaoh, Forsooth, we are venuti to dwell in terra as hospites; for thy servos have no pastura, because the famis is heavy in terra Chanaan: now therefore we pray thee, let thy servos dwell in terra Gosen.",
  "And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy pater, and thy fratres, are venuti unto thee:",
  " Terra Aegypti is before thee; in the best of terra make them dwell; let them dwell in terra Ramesse, as thou hast spoken; let them also be stewards of my substantia.",
  "And Joseph placed his patrem, and his fratres, and gave them possessio in terra Aegypti, in the best of terra, in terra Ramesse, as Pharaoh had commanded.",
  "And Joseph nourished his patrem, and his fratres, and all his patris domus, with panis, according to the number of their liberi.",
  "And there was no panis in terra; for the famis was very heavy, so that terra Aegypti and all terra Chanaan were destitute of substantia.",
  "And Joseph gathered up all the argentum that was found in terra Aegypti, and in terra Chanaan, for the annona, which they bought: and Joseph brought the argentum into the domus Pharaonis.",
  "And when argentum failed in terra Aegypti, and in terra Chanaan, all the Aegyptii came unto Joseph, and said, Give us panis: why should we mori before thy faciem? for argentum faileth.",
  "And Joseph said, Bring your anima, and I will give you for them: if argentum faileth.",
  "And they brought their anima; and Joseph gave them panis for the equi, and for the armentum, and for the bestiae, and for the asini: and he fed them with panis for all their anima that anno.",
  "When that anno was ended, they came unto him the sequens anno, and said unto him, We will not celare from my domine, how that argentum faileth; my domine hath the thesauri, and the anima, and there is not any thing left before my domine, but our corpora, and terra.",
  "Why shall we mori before thy oculi, both we and terra? buy us and our terra for panis, and we and terra will be servi to Pharaoh: and give us semen, that we may vivere, and not mori, that terra may not be deserta.",
  "And Joseph bought all terra Aegyptii for Pharaonis, for the Aegyptii sold every homo his ager, because the famis was very heavy upon them: so terra Aegypti became Pharaonis.",
  "And as for populus, he removed them to the urbes, from the finis terra Aegyptii, even to the finis thereof.",
  "Only terra sacerdotum bought he not; for the sacerdotes had a portio assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their portio, which Pharaoh had given them: wherefore they sold not their terra.",
  "And Joseph said unto populus, Behold, I have bought you this day and your terra for Pharaonis: lo, here is semen for you, and ye shall sow terra.",
  "And it shall be when the messis shall grow, that ye shall give the quintam part unto Pharaonis, and four partes shall be your own, for semen and for sementem your campos, and for your esca, and for them of your domus, and for victum.",
  "And they said, Thou hast salvatus our anima: let us invenire gratiam in the oculi of my domine, and we will be servi to Pharaoh.",
  "And Joseph made it a lex in terra Aegyptii unto this day, that Pharaonis should have the quintam part; except the terra of sacerdotum only, which did not become Pharaonis.",
  "And Israel habitavit in terra Aegyptii, in terra Gosen; and they had possessio therein, and grew, and multiplicati sunt very much.",
  "And Jacob lived in terra Aegyptii seventeen anni: so the dies of Jacob were an hundred forty and seven anni.",
  "And the dies of Israel drew nigh that he must mori: and he called his filium Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have trovatus gratiam in thy oculi, put, I pray thee, thy manus under my coxa, and deal with me according to mercimonia, and according to veritas, not to sepelech me in Aegyptus:",
  "But I will ligo with my patres, and thou shalt bear me out of Aegyptus, and bury me in their sepulchre. And he said, I will do according to thy sermon.",
  "And he said, Swear to me: and he swore unto him. And Israel blessed God."
