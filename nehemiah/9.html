                    <p>Now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting, and with sackcloth, and earth upon them.</p>
<p>And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all strangers, and stood and confessed their peccata, and the iniquitates of their patres.</p>
<p>And they stood up in their locus, and read in the book of the law of the Lord their Deus for one fourth part of the day; and another fourth part they confessed, and worshipped the Lord their Deus.</p>
<p>Then stood up upon the stairs, of the Levites, Jeshua, and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani, and cried with a loud vox to the Lord their Deus.</p>
<p>Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah, Sherebiah, Hodijah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said, Stand up and bless the Lord your Deus for ever and ever: and blessed be thy glorious nomen, which is exalted above all benediction and laud.</p>
<p>Thou, even thou, art Lord alone; thou hast made caelum, the caelum of the caeli, with all their host, the terra, and all things that are therein, the maria, and all that is therein: thou preservest them all; and the host of caelum worshippeth thee.</p>
<p>Thou art the Lord the Deus, who didst choose Abram, and broughtest him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gavest him the nomen of Abraham;</p>
<p>And foundest his cor to be fidelis before thee, and madest a foedus with him to give him the terra of the Canaanites, of the Hittites, of the Amorites, and of the Perizzites, and of the Jebusites, and of the Girgashites, to give it, I say, to his semen, and hast performed thy verba; for thou art iustus:</p>
<p>And thou sawest the afflictio of our patres in Aegypt, and heardest their clamor by the Red Sea;</p>
<p>And shewedst signs and prodigia upon Pharaoh, and on all his servos, and on all the populus of his terra: for thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them. So didst thou get thee a nomen, as it is this day.</p>
<p>And thou didst divide the maria before them, so that they went through the midst of the maria on the terra; and their enemies thou threwest into the profundum, as a lapidem into the profundum waters.</p>
<p>Moreover thou leddest them in the daytime by a columna of nubes, and in the nocte by a columna of ignis, to give them lux in the way wherein they should go.</p>
<p>Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them from caelum, and gavest them iudicia recta, and leges verae, bona statuta and mandata:</p>
<p>And madest known unto them thy sanctum Sabbatum, and commandedst them precepta, and statuta, and leges, by the hand of Moses thy servus:</p>
<p>And gavest them panem from caelum for their esurientia, and broughtest forth aqua for them out of the petra for their sitis, and promisedst them that they should go in to possess the terra which thou hadst sworn to give them.</p>
<p>But they and our patres dealt proudly, and hardened their cervices, and hearkened not to thy mandata,</p>
<p>And refused to obey, neither were mindful of thy mirabilia that thou didst among them; but hardened their cervices, and in their rebellio appointed a dux to return to their servitium: but thou art a Deus ready to propitiari, gracious and misericors, slow to ira, and of great clementia, and forsookest them not.</p>
<p>Yea, when they had made them a vitulus of metallum, and said, This is thy Deus that brought thee up out of Aegypt, and had wrought great blasphemia;</p>
<p>Yet thou in thy multa misericordia forsookest them not in the desert: the columna of nubes departed not from them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the columna of ignis by nocte, to shew them lux, and the way wherein they should go.</p>
<p>Thou gavest also thy bonum Spiritus to be their mens, and withheldest not thy panis from their os, and gavest them aqua for their esurientia.</p>
<p>Yea, forty annos didst thou sustain them in the desert, so that they lacked nothing; their vestes waxed not old, and their pedes swelled not.</p>
<p>Moreover thou gavest them regna and populos, and didst divide them into corners: so they possessed the terra of Sihon, and the terra of the king of Heshbon, and the terra of Og king of Bashan.</p>
<p>Their filii also multipliedst thou as the stellae of caelum, and broughtest them into the terra, concerning which thou hadst promised to their patres, that they should go in to possess it.</p>
<p>So the filii went in and possessed the terra, and thou subduedst before them the incolas of the terra, the Canaanites, and gavest them into their manus, with their reges, and the populos of the terra, that they might do with them as they would.</p>
<p>And they took strong urbes, and a terra fat and fertile, and possessed houses full of all bona, cisternas digged, vineae, and oliveta, and fructiferous trees in abundance: so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in thy great bona.</p>
<p>Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and cast thy leges behind their dorsa, and slew thy prophetas, which testified against them to turn them to thee, and they wrought great blasphemia.</p>
<p>Therefore thou deliveredst them into the manus of their enemies, who vexed them: and in the tempus of their afflictio, when they cried unto thee, thou heardest them from caelum; and according to thy multa misericordia thou gavest them saviours, who saved them out of the manus of their enemies.</p>
<p>But after they had rest, they did again that which was malum before thee: therefore leftest thou them in the manus of their enemies, so that they had the dominium over them: yet when they returned, and cried unto thee, thou heardest them from caelum, and many tempora didst thou deliver them according to thy misericordia;</p>
<p>And testifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring them again unto thy lex: yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not unto thy mandata, but sinned against thy iudicia, (which if a homo do, he shall live in them;) and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their cervices, and would not hear.</p>
<p>Yet many annos didst thou forbear them, and testifiedst against them by thy Spirit in thy prophetas: yet would they not give ear: therefore gavest thou them into the manus of the populi of the terra.</p>
<p>Nevertheless for thy multa misericordia's sake thou didst not utterly consume them, nor forsake them; for thou art a Deus gracious and misericors.</p>
<p>Now therefore, our Deus, the great, the potent, and the terrible Deus, who keepest foedus and misericordia, let not all the trouble seem little before thee, that hath come upon us, on our reges, on our principes, and on our sacerdotes, and on our patres, and on all thy populus, since the tempus of the reges of Assyria unto this day.</p>
<p>Howbeit thou art iustus in all that is come upon us; for thou hast done recte, but we have done wickedly:</p>
<p>Neither have our reges, our principes, our sacerdotes, nor our patres, kept thy lex, nor attended to thy mandata, and thy testimonies, wherewith thou didst testify against them.</p>
<p>For they have not served thee in their regnum, and in thy multa bona that thou gavest them, and in the terra large and fertile which thou gavest before them, neither turned they from their malae manuum: behold, we are servi this day.</p>
<p>And for all this, we make a firm foedus, and write it; and our principes, Levites, and sacerdotes, seal unto it.</p>
