                    <p>And there was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was the firstborn of Joseph; to wit, for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead: because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan.</p>
<p>There was also a lot for the rest of the children of Manasseh by their families; for the children of Abiezer, and for the children of Helek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the children of Shechem, and for the children of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida: these were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph by their families.</p>
<p>But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters: and these are the names of his daughters, Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.</p>
<p>And they came near before Eleazar the sacerdos, and before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the principes, saying, the Lord commanded Moses to give us an inheritancia by lot among our brethren. Therefore according to the commandment of the Lord he gave them an hereditas among the brethren of their pater.</p>
<p>And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, beside the land of Gilead and Bashan, which were on the other side Jordan;</p>
<p>Because the daughters of Manasseh had an hereditas among his filii: and the rest of Manasseh's filii had the land of Gilead.</p>
<p>And the border of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah, that lieth before Shechem; and the border went along on the right hand unto the inhabitants of Entappuah.</p>
<p>Now the land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh; but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the filii of Ephraim;</p>
<p>And the border descended unto the river Kanah, southward of the river: these cities of Ephraim are among the cities of Manasseh: the border of Manasseh also was on the north side of the river, and the goings out of it were at the sea:</p>
<p>Southward it was Ephraim's, and northward it was Manasseh's, and the sea is his border; and they met together in Asher on the north, and in Issachar on the east.</p>
<p>And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Bethshean and her towns, and Ibleam and her towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and her towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns, even three countries.</p>
<p>Yet the filii of Manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants of those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.</p>
<p>Yet it came to pass, when the filii of Israel were waxen strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute; but did not utterly drive them out.</p>
<p>And the filii of Joseph spake unto Joshua, saying, Why hast thou given me but one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing I am a populus of great multitude, since hucusque the Lord hath blessed me?</p>
<p>And Joshua said unto them, If thou be a populus of great multitude, then get thee up to the forest country, and cut down for thyself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the giants, if mount Ephraim be too narrow for thee.</p>
<p>And the filii of Joseph said, The hill is not enough for us: and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of ferreum.</p>
<p>And Joshua said unto the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and to Manasseh, Thou art a populus of great multitude, and hast great potestas: thou shalt not have one lot only:</p>
<p>But the mountain shall be thine; for it is a forest, and thou shalt cut it down: and the outgoings of it shall be thine: for thou shalt drive out the Canaanites, though they have ferreum chariots, and though they be strong.</p>
