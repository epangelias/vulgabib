                    <p>The mighty God, even the Lord, hath spoken, and called the terra from the rising of the sol to the going down thereof.</p>
<p>Out of Zion, the perfection of pulchritude, God hath shined.</p>
<p>Our God shall come, and shall not keep silent: a ignis shall devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him.</p>
<p>He shall call to the caelum from above, and to the terra, that he may judicare his populus.</p>
<p>Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a foedus with me by sacrificium.</p>
<p>And the caelum shall declare his justitia: for God is judex himself. Selah.</p>
<p>Hear, O my populus, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testificor against thee: I am Deus, thy Deus.</p>
<p>I will not reprove thee for thy sacrificia or thy holocausta, because they are ever before me.</p>
<p>I will take no young animal out of thy domus, nor he-goats out of thy folds.</p>
<p>For every animal of the silva is mine, and the cattle upon a thousand colles.</p>
<p>I know all the aves of the montes: and the wild beasts of the ager are mine.</p>
<p>If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the mundus is mine, and the fulness thereof.</p>
<p>Shall I eat the flesh of boves, or drink the sanguis of hircos?</p>
<p>Offer unto Deus sacrificium of laudis; and pay thy vota unto the Altissimus:</p>
<p>And call upon me in the die of tribulation: I will liberate thee, and thou shalt honorific me.</p>
<p>But unto the impie Deus saith, What hast thou to do to declare my statuta, or that thou shouldest take my foedus in thy os?</p>
<p>Seeing thou hatest instructio, and castest my verba behind thee.</p>
<p>When thou sawest a fur, thou consentedst with him, and hast been particeps with adulteri:</p>
<p>Thou gavest thy os to malitia, and thy lingua frameth deceit.</p>
<p>Thou sittest and speakest against thy frater; thou slanderest thine own mater's filius.</p>
<p>These things hast thou done, and I kept silent; thou thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself: but I will reprove thee, and set them in order before thine eyes.</p>
<p>Now consider this, ye that forget Deus, lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to liberate.</p>
<p>Whoso offereth sacrificium of laudis shall glorific me: and to him that ordereth his iter aright will I shew the salus of Deus.</p>
