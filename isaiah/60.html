                    <p>Arise, lux, for tibi est lux, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.</p>
<p>For, behold, the tenebrae shall cover the earth, and grossa tenebrae the people: but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee.</p>
<p>And the Gentiles shall come to thy lux, and kings to the splendor of thy rising.</p>
<p>Lift up thine oculi round about, and see: all they gather themselves together, they come to thee: thy filii shall come from far, and thy filiae shall be nursed at thy side.</p>
<p>Then thou shalt see, and flow together, and thine cor shall fear, and be enlarged; because the multitude of the sea shall be converted unto thee, the forces of the Gentiles shall come unto thee.</p>
<p>The multitude of cameli shall cover thee, the dromedarii of Midian and Ephah; all they from Sheba shall come: they shall bring aurum and thus, and they shall shew forth the laudes of the Lord.</p>
<p>All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together unto thee, the rams of Nebaioth shall minister unto thee: they shall come up with acceptance on mine altar, and I will glorify the domus of my majesty.</p>
<p>Who are these that fly as a nubes, and as the columbae to their fenestrae?</p>
<p>Surely the insulae shall wait for me, and the navis of the sea first, to bring thy filii from far, their argentum and aurum with them, unto the nomen of the Lord thy God, and to the Sanctus of Israel, because he hath glorified thee.</p>
<p>And the filii of strangers shall build thy muros, and their kings shall minister unto thee: for in my ira I smote thee, but in my bonitas have I had mercy on thee.</p>
<p>Therefore thy portae shall be aperte continually; they shall not be shutte day nor night; that men may bring unto thee the forces of the Gentiles, and that their kings may be brought.</p>
<p>For the gens which shall not serve thee shall perish; yea, those gentes shall be utterly destroyed.</p>
<p>The glory of Libanus shall come unto thee, the fir tree, the pine tree, and the box tree together, to beautify the locum of my sanctuarium; and I will make the locum of my pedes glorious.</p>
<p>The filii also of them that afflicted thee shall come bending unto thee; and all they that despised thee shall bow themselves downe at the soles of thy pedes; and they shall call thee, The civitas of the Lord, The Zion of the Sanctus of Israel.</p>
<p>Whereas thou hast been forsaken and hated, so that no man went through thee, I will make thee a joy of many generations; thou shalt be a joyous civitas, and thy filii shall marry.</p>
<p>And I will make thee a joy, and thy filii a joy: and thy Deus shall be thy joy, and thy filii shall rejoice in thee.</p>
<p>Thou shalt also suck the lac of the Gentiles, and the mammas of kings: and thou shalt know that I the Lord am thy Salvator and thy Redemptor, the Fortis of Jacob.</p>
<p>For brasum I will give thee aurum, and for ferrum I will give thee argentum, and for lapides I will give thee pretiosi lapides, and for lignum I will give thee cedrum.</p>
<p>I will also make thy officiales pacem, and thine exactores justitiam.</p>
<p>Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, wasting nor destruction within thy termini; but thou shalt call thy muros Salvus, and thy portae Laus.</p>
<p>The sunne shall be no more thy lucerna by day; neither for the lumen of the moonne shall thou have need: for the Lord shall be unto thee an everlasting lucerna, and thy Deus thy glory.</p>
<p>Thy sol shall no more go downe; neither shall thy luna withdrawe itselfe: for the Lord shall be thine everlasting lucerna, and the days of thy mourning shall be ended.</p>
<p>Thy people also shall be all justi; they shall inherit the terra for ever, the germen of my planting, the work of my manus, that I may be glorified.</p>
