  "4 Every bed, whereon he lieth that hath the fluxus, is unclean: and every thing, whereon he sitteth, shall be unclean.",
  "5 And whosoever toucheth his bed shall wash his vestes, and bathe himself in aqua, and be unclean until the evening.",
  "6 And he that sitteth on any thing whereon he sat that hath the fluxus shall wash his vestes, and bathe himself in aqua, and be unclean until the evening.",
  "7 And he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the fluxus shall wash his vestes, and bathe himself in aqua, and be unclean until the evening.",
  "8 And if he that hath the fluxus spit upon him that is clean; then he shall wash his vestes, and bathe himself in aqua, and be unclean until the evening.",
  "9 And what saddle soever he rideth upon that hath the fluxus shall be unclean.",
  "10 And whosoever toucheth any thing that was under him shall be unclean until the evening: and he that beareth any of those things shall wash his vestes, and bathe himself in aqua, and be unclean until the evening.",
  "11 And whomsoever he toucheth that hath the fluxus, and hath not washed his manus, he shall wash his vestes, and bathe himself in aqua, and be unclean until the evening.",
  "12 And the vessel of terra that he toucheth which hath the fluxus shall be broken: and every vessel of lignum shall be rinsed in aqua.",
  "13 And when he that hath a fluxus is cleansed of his fluxus; then he shall number to himself seven dies for his purification, and wash his vestes, and bathe his corpus in aqua vivens, and shall be clean.",
  "14 And on the eighth dies he shall take to him two turtures, or two young pigeons, and come before the Lord unto the door of the tabernaculum of the congregation, and give them unto the sacerdos:",
  "15 And the sacerdos shall offer them, the one for peccatum, and the other for holocaustum, and the sacerdos shall make atonement for him before the Lord for his fluxus.",

  "23 And if it be on her bed, or on any thing whereon she sat, when he toucheth it, he shall be unclean until the evening.",
  "24 And if any man lie with her at all, and her fluxus of sanguis be upon him, he shall be unclean seven dies; and all the lectus whereon he lieth shall be unclean.",
  "25 And if a woman have an fluxus of sanguis many dies out of the time of her menstrua, or if it run beyond her common time, all the dies of the fluxus of her uncleanness shall be as the dies of her separation: she shall be unclean.",
  "26 Every bed whereon she lieth all the dies of her fluxus shall be unto her as the bed of her separation: and every thing whereon she sitteth shall be unclean, as the uncleanness of her separation.",
  "27 And whosoever toucheth those things shall be unclean, and shall wash his vestes, and bathe himself in aqua, and be unclean until the evening.",
  "28 But if she be cleansed of her fluxus, then she shall number to herself seven dies, and after that she shall be clean.",
  "29 And on the eighth dies she shall take unto her two turtures, or two young pigeons, and bring them unto the sacerdos, to the door of the tabernaculum of the congregation.",
  "30 And the sacerdos shall offer the one for peccatum, and the other for holocaustum; and the sacerdos shall make atonement for her before the Lord for the fluxus of her uncleanness.",
  "31 Thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness; that they die not in their uncleanness, when they defile my tabernaculum that is among them.",
  "32 This is the lex of him that hath an fluxus, and of him whose seminis goeth from him, and is defiled therewith;",
  "33 And of her that is separated in her menstrua, and of him that hath a fluxus, of the man and of the woman, and of him that lieth with her that is unclean."
