                    <p>Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem one and thirty years.</p>
<p>And he did that which was rectus in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the ways of David his father, and declined neither to the dexter nor to the sinister.</p>
<p>For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the Deus of David his father: and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the groves, and the sculptilia, and the molten imagines.</p>
<p>And they brake down the altaria of Baalim in his presence; and the images, that were on high above them, he cut down; and the groves, and the sculptilia, and the molten imagines, he brake in pieces, and made dust of them, and strewed it upon the sepulchres of them that had sacrificed unto them.</p>
<p>And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altaria, and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem.</p>
<p>And so did he in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and Simeon, even unto Naphtali, with their gladii in circuit.</p>
<p>And when he had broken down the altaria and the groves, and had beaten the sculptilia into dust, and had cut down all the imagines throughout all the land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land, and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the Lord his Deus.</p>
<p>And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered the pecunia that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites that kept the gates had gathered of the manu of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin, and they returned to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>And they put it in the manu of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of the Lord, and they gave it to the workmen which wrought in the house of the Lord, to repair and amend the house:</p>
<p>Even to the artificers and builders gave they it, to buy hewn stones, and timber for couplings, and to floor the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed.</p>
<p>And the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them were Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to set it forward; and other of the Levites, all that could skill of instruments of musick.</p>
<p>Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and were overseers of all that wrought the work in any manner of service: and of the Levites there were scribes, and judges, and porters.</p>
<p>And when they brought out the pecunia that was brought into the house of the Lord, Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the Lord given by Moses.</p>
<p>And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the Lord. And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.</p>
<p>And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and brought the king word back again, saying, All that was committed to thy servants, they do it.</p>
<p>And they have gathered together the pecunia that was found in the house of the Lord, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and to the hand of the workmen.</p>
<p>Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath given me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he rent his vestes.</p>
<p>And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king, saying,</p>
