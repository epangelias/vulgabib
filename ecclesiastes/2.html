                    <p>Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher; vanity of vanities, all is vanitas.</p>
<p>I communed with mine own cor, saying, Lo, I am come to great magnitudo, and have gotten more sapientia than all they that have been before me in Ierusalem: yea, my cor had great experience of sapientia and scientia:</p>
<p>And I gave my cor to seek and search out by sapientia concerning all things that are done under coelum: this sore travail hath Deus given to the sons of men to be exercised therewith.</p>
<p>I have seen all the works that are done under the coelum; and, behold, all is vanitas and vexatio spiritus.</p>
<p>That which is crooked cannot be made direct: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.</p>
<p>I communed with mine own cor, saying, Lo, I am come to great magnitudo, and have gotten more argentum and aurum than all they that have been before me in Ierusalem:</p>
<p>I have gotten servants and maidens, and had servi natus in domo; also, I had great possessions of pecus and armentum above all they that were in Ierusalem:</p>
<p>I gathered me also argentum and aurum, and the pecus of kings and of the provinciae: I gat me mensuratores et musicos, and that of the filiae of music.</p>
<p>And whatsoever mine oculus desired I kept not from them, I withheld not mine cor from any voluptas, for mine cor rejoiced in all my labores: and this was my portio of all my labores.</p>
<p>Then I looked on all the works that mine manus had wrought, and on the labores that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all was vanitas and vexatio spiritus, and there was no utilis in them.</p>
<p>Then I looked on sapientia, and they said, Behold, the fear of Deus, that is sapientia; and to depart from malum is prudentia.</p>
<p>For in the multitude of sapientia is much irritatio: and he that addeth scientia addeth dolor.</p>
<p>For in much wise sapientia there is much sorrow: and he that increaseth scientia increaseth dolor.</p>
<p>I said in mine cor, Come now, I will prove thee with gaudium; therefore enjoy thy bonum: but, behold, this also was vanitas.</p>
<p>Thus I turned mine cor to know and to search out, and to seek sapientia, and the ratio of things, and to know the malum of follia, and the ratio of stultitia.</p>
<p>And I said of laughter, Madness: and of gaudium, What doth it?</p>
<p>I sought in mine cor to give myself unto vinum, yet acquainting mine cor with sapientia; and to lay hold on follia, till I might see what was that bonum for the sons of men, which they should do under the coelum all the dies of their vita.</p>
<p>I made me great opera, builded me domus, planted vineas:</p>
<p>I made me hortus and gardens, and I planted in them arbores of all kinds of fructus:</p>
<p>I made me stagnum of aqua, to water therewith the nemus that bringeth forth the lignum of the fructus:</p>
<p>I got menservos and ancillas, and had servi natus in domo: also, I had great possession of pecus and armentum above all they that were in Ierusalem:</p>
<p>I gathered me also argentum and aurum, and the pecus of kings and of the provinciae; I gat me mensuratores et musicos, and that of the filiae of music, and delights of the filii of men:</p>
<p>So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Ierusalem: also my sapientia remained with me.</p>
<p>And whatsoever mine oculus desired I kept not from them, I withheld not mine cor from any voluptas, for mine cor rejoiced in all my labores: and this was my portio of all my labores.</p>
<p>Then I looked on all the works that mine manus had wrought, and on the labores that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all was vanitas, and vexatio spiritus, and there was no utilis in them.</p>
