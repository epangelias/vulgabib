  "1 And he brought me forth into the outward court, and led me about peripheriam, and behold, there were chambers et cubiculi, that were toward the north, between the outer porticus and the inner porticus: twenty and thirty chambers were they.",
  "2 Before the length of a hundred cubits was the north door, and the breadth was fifty cubits.",
  "3 Over against the twenty cubits which were for the inner aula, and over against the pavement that was for the outward aula, was gallery contra gallery in three stories.",
  "4 And before the chambers was a walk of ten cubits breadth inward, a way of one cubitus, and their doors toward the north.",
  "5 Now the upper chambers were shorter: for the galleries were higher than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost of the building.",
  "6 For they were in three stories, but had not pillars as the pillars of the courts: therefore the building was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground.",
  "7 And the wall that was without over against the chambers, toward the outward court on the fore part of the chambers, the length thereof was fifty cubits.",
  "8 For the length of the chambers that were in the corner was fifty cubits: and, lo, before the temple was a hundred cubits.",
  "9 And from under these chambers was the entry on the east side, as one goeth into them from the outward court.",
  "10 The chambers were in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, over against the separate place, and over against the building.",
  "11 And the way before them was like the appearance of the way of the chambers which were toward the north, as long as they, as broad as they: and all their goings out were both according to their fancies, and according to their doors.",
  "12 And according to the doors of the chambers that were toward the south was a door in the head of the way, even the way directly before the wall toward the east, as one entereth into them.",
  "13 Then said he unto me, The north chambers and the south chambers, which are before the separate place, they be holy chambers, where the priests that approach unto the Lord shall eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; for the place is holy.",
  "14 When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of the holy place into the outward court, but there they shall lay their vestes, wherein they minister; for they are sanctae vestes: and they shall put on other vestes, and so shall they come forth to the people.",
  "15 Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner domus, he brought me forth toward the gate that looketh toward the orient, and he measured it round about.",
  "16 He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.",
  "17 He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.",
  "18 He measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed.",
  "19 He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed.",
  "20 He measured it by the four sides: it had a wall round about, five hundred reeds long, and five hundred broad, to make a separation between the sanctuary and the profane place."
