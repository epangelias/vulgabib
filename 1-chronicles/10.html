                    <p>And the Philistines 'persequuti sunt' (pursued) David, and 'premens' (overtaking) him, they 'cingebant' (compassed) him and his men.</p>
<p>David 'eruisset' (escaped) with difficulty, but the Philistines 'occupaverunt' (occupied) the 'montem' (mountain).</p>
<p>And 'Saul ascensus est' (Saul went up) to 'montem' (mount) Gilboa, and behold, 'vidit' (saw) the 'turba' (multitude) of the Philistines, and 'timuit' (feared) and 'tremuit' (trembled) greatly.</p>
<p>And Saul 'dixit' (said) to the 'armiger' ( armour bearer), 'evagina' (draw) thy 'gladius' (sword) and 'percute' (thrust through) me with it, lest these 'incircumcisi' (uncircumcised) come and 'crudeliter' (cruelly) 'abuten' (abuse) me.</p>
<p>But the 'armiger' (armour bearer) 'noluit' (would not), for 'timuit' (feared) greatly, and Saul 'sumpsit' (took) the 'gladius' (sword) and 'incubuit' (fell) upon it.</p>
<p>And when the 'armiger' (armour bearer) 'vidit' (saw) that Saul 'erat' (was) dead, he 'incubuit' (fell) likewise upon the 'gladius' (sword), and 'mortuus est' (died).</p>
<p>Thus 'mortuus est' (died) Saul, and the 'tres filii' (three sons) and the 'armiger' (armour bearer), and 'omnis anima' (all the men) that were with him in that day.</p>
<p>And when the 'filii' (sons) of 'Israel qui' (who) were 'trans' (beyond) the 'vallis' (valley) 'vidissent' (saw) that they 'fugerant' (had fled) and that Saul and the 'filii' (sons) were 'mortui' (dead), they 'reliquierunt' (left) their 'civitates' (cities) and 'fugerant' (fled).</p>
<p>And the Philistines 'venientes' (coming) 'occupaverunt' (occupied) them, and the 'habitatores' (inhabitants) of the 'civitates' (cities) which were in the 'sepentrione' (north) 'in' (in) 'monte' (mount) Ephraim and in 'omni' (all) the 'terra' (land) of Israel, 'donec' (until) 'venerunt' (came) to the 'Jordanes' (Jordan).</p>
<p>And the 'populus' (people) of 'Israel congregatus est' (assembled), and they 'flebant' (mourned) Saul and the 'filii' (sons) and the 'domus' (house) of him, and 'omnis' (all) the 'populus' (people) of the 'terra' (land) of Israel 'donec' (until) the 'vespera' (evening).</p>
