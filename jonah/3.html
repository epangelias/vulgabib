                    <p>And the word of Dominus came unto Jonah the second time, saying,</p>
<p>Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great cititas, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee.</p>
<p>So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of Dominus. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great cititas of three days' journey.</p>
<p>And Jonah began to enter into the cititas a day's journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be subverted.</p>
<p>So the people of Nineveh believed Deus, and proclaimed a ieiunium, and put on saccloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.</p>
<p>For word came unto the rex of Nineveh, and he arose from his thronus, and he laid his vestis from him, and covered him with saccloth, and sat in cineres.</p>
<p>And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the rex and his optimates, saying, Let neither homo nor animal, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor drink water:</p>
<p>But let homo and animal be covered with saccloth, and cry mightily unto Deus: yea, let them turn every one from his evil via, and from the violence that is in their manus.</p>
<p>Who can tell if Deus will turn and repent, and turn away from his fervent indignatio, that we perish not?</p>
<p>And Deus saw their opera, that they turned from their evil via; and Deus repented of the malum, that he had said he would do unto them; and he did it not.</p>
