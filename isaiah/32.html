                    <p>Behold, a King shall reigne in iustitia, and princes shall rule in iudicium.</p>
<p>For the terre shall be filled with scientia of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.</p>
<p>The ouvert and the secret places shall not be hid from the Lord, for his oculus shall be upon them for ever.</p>
<p>Blessed are ye that semente iustitia, which shall reap in iustitia, and whose oculus beholdeth the Lord.</p>
<p>And my populus shall dwell in tabernaculum pacis, and in habitaculis fiducia, and in quies tranquillitas.</p>
<p>O filii Sion, be glad and rejoice in the Lord your Deus, for he hath given you a benediction of annus abundans.</p>
<p>Lo, the Lord shall come with fortitudo, and his brachium shall rule for him, behold his merces with him, and his operae before him.</p>
<p>Qui timetis the Lord, wait for him, and your oculus shall see his salus, and your aures shall hear of his laus.</p>
<p>The desiderium of the righteous shall be given, and the brachium of the wicked shall be broken.</p>
<p>For behold, the Lord shall come to iudicare terram, and to arguere orbem terre, and to redarguere impium in iustitia sua, and to corripere impium in furore suo.</p>
<p>Qui ambulat iuste, et loquitur recte, et odit avaritiam, and spuit rapinam, and dimittit manus suas ab omni munere injuste.</p>
<p>His manus non sunt extentae ad munera injusta, and non accepit munus in conspectu suo, qui facit ista non movebitur in aeternum.</p>
<p>Be glad, O filia Sion, and be exsulte, O filia Ierusalem, for behold thy King venit in iustitia, and salvus, he shall send forth iudicium and iustitia.</p>
<p>The ouvert and the secret places shall not be hid from the King, for his oculus shall be upon them for ever.</p>
<p>The populus non timebit, nec timore afficetur, quia in te credimus, Deus noster, et nomen tuum invocamus, et annuntiamus inter gentes magnalia tua.</p>
<p>For the terre shall be filled with scientia of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.</p>
