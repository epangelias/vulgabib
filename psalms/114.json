[
  "When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange lingua,",
  "Judah was his sanctuarium, and Israel his dominium.",
  "The mare, it was the Red Sea, and it turned back, and the aqua returned to its proprium locum,",
  "And they went through the medium of the mare, as per agrum,",
  "And the aqua was a murus to them on their dexter side and on their sinister side.",
  "The gentes saw them, and they were terrifyed, and they fled, and they were dissipati,",
  "The mare covered them, and they were absorpti in the profundum, as lapides.",
  "Nunc, Israel, gaude, and make a cantus to the Domino, qui te fecit,",
  "And honor his nomen, because he is magnus, and his misericordia is in aeternum."
