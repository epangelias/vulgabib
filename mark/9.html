                    <p>1 And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That there be some of them that stand here, which shall not taste mors, (death), till they have seen the regnum Dei (kingdom of God) come with potestas (power).</p>
<p>2 And after six dies (days) Jesus taketh with him Petrus (Peter), and Jacobus (James), and Johannes (John), and leadeth them up into an high mons (mountain) apart by themselves: and he was transfiguratus (transfigured) before them.</p>
<p>3 And his vestimenta (clothing) became shining, exceeding white as nive (snow); so as no fullon (fuller) on earth can make white.</p>
<p>4 And there appeared unto them Elias (Elijah) with Moyses (Moses): and they were talking with Jesus.</p>
<p>5 And Petrus (Peter) answered and said to Jesus, Rabbi, it is bonum (good) for us to be here: and let us make tres tabernacula (three tabernacles); one for thee, and one for Moyses (Moses), and one for Elias (Elijah).</p>
<p>6 For he wist (knew) not what he said; for they were territi (terrified).</p>
<p>7 And there was a nubes (cloud) that overshadowed them: and a vox (voice) came out of the nubes (cloud), saying, This is Filius meus (my Son) dilectus (beloved): hear him.</p>
<p>8 Suddenly, when they had looked round about, they saw no man any more, save Jesus only with them.</p>
<p>9 And as they came down from the mons (mountain), he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen, till the Filius hominis (Son of man) were risen from mortui (the dead).</p>
<p>10 And they kept that saying with themselves, questioning one with another what the rising from mortui (the dead) should mean.</p>
<p>11 And they asked him, saying, Why say the scribae (scribes) that Elias (Elijah) must first come?</p>
<p>12 And he answered and told them, Elias (Elijah) verily cometh first, and restoreth omnia (all things); and how it is written of the Filium hominis (Son of man), that he must suffer multa (many things), and be contemnus (despised).</p>
<p>13 But I say unto you, That Elias (Elijah) is already venit (come), and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed, as it is written of him.</p>
<p>14 And when he came to his discipuli (disciples), he saw a great multitudo (multitude) about them, and the scribae (scribes) questioning with them.</p>
<p>15 And straightway all the populus (people) saw him, and were magis (more) astonied, and running to him salutabant (greeted) him.</p>
<p>16 And he asked the scribae (scribes), What question ye with them?</p>
<p>17 And one of the multitudo (multitude) answered and said, Magister (Master), I have brought unto thee my filius (son), having a spiritus (spirit) mutus (dumb):</p>
<p>18 And wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him: and he foameth, and gnasheth with the dentes (teeth), and pineth away: and I spake to thy discipuli (disciples) that they should eicere (cast) him out; and they could not.</p>
<p>19 He answereth him, and saith, O generatio incredula (faithless generation), how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him unto me.</p>
<p>20 And they brought him unto him: and when he saw him, straightway the spiritus (spirit) torsi (tore) him; and he fell on the terra (ground), and wallowed foaming.</p>
<p>21 And he asked his pater (father), How long is it ago since this came unto him? And he said, Of a puer (child).</p>
<p>22 And ofttimes it hath cast him into ignem (fire), and into aqua (water), to destroy him: but if tu potes (thou canst) facere (do) any thing, have misericordiam (mercy) on us, and adjuva (help) us.</p>
<p>23 Jesus said unto him, Si potes credere (If thou canst believe), omnia possibilia sunt credenti (all things are possible to him that believeth).</p>
<p>24 And straightway the pater (father) of the puer (child) cried out, and said with lacrimis (tears), Domine (Lord), I believe; adjuva (help) thou mine incredulitas (unbelief).</p>
<p>25 When Jesus saw that the populus (people) came running together, he reprehendit (rebuked) the spiritum immundum (unclean spirit), saying unto him, Tu spiritus mutus et surdus (thou dumb and deaf spirit), I charge thee, eice (come out) of him, and enter not in him any more.</p>
<p>26 And the spiritus (spirit) cried, and rent him sore, and came out: and he was sicut mortuus (like one dead); insomuch that many said, He is mortuus (dead).</p>
<p>27 But Jesus took him by the manus (hand), and lift him up; and he arose.</p>
<p>28 And when he was come into domus (house), his discipuli (disciples) asked him privately, Why could not we eicere (cast) him out?</p>
<p>29 And he said unto them, This genus (kind) can come forth by no thing, but by oratione (prayer) and jejunio (fasting).</p>
<p>30 And they departed thence, and passed through Galilaea (Galilee); and he would not that any man should scire (know it).</p>
<p>31 For he taught his discipuli (disciples), and said unto them, The Filius hominis (Son of man) shall be traditus (delivered) into the manus (hands) of homines (men), and they shall interficere (kill) him; and after he is mortuus (dead), he shall resurgere (rise) the tertius (third) die (day).</p>
<p>32 But they understood not that saying, and were timidi (afraid) to interrogare (ask) him.</p>
<p>33 And he came to Capharnaum (Capernaum): and being in domus (house), he asked them, Quid disputabatis in via (What were ye disputing in the way)?</p>
<p>34 But they held their pace, scire (knowing) nothing, because in via (in the way) they were disputing inter se (among themselves), Qui maior esset (who was the greatest).</p>
<p>35 And he sat down, and called the duodecim (twelve), and saith unto them, Si quis vult esse primus (If any man desire to be first), erit ultimus (shall be last) omnium et servus (of all and servant).</p>
<p>36 And he took a puer (child), and set him in the medio (midst) of them: and when he had implexus (embraced) him, he said unto them,</p>
<p>37 Quicumque susceperit unum ex hujusmodi pueris (Whosoever shall receive one of such children) in nomine meo (in my name), me suscipit (receiveth me): and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth not me, sed eum qui me misit (but him that sent me).</p>
<p>38 Johannes (John) answered him, saying, Magister (Master), we saw one eiciens (casting out) daemonia (devils) in tuo nomine (thy name), and he followeth not us: and we prohibuimus (forbade) him, quia non sequitur nos (because he followeth not us).</p>
<p>39 But Jesus said, Nolite prohibere (Forbid him not): for there is nemo (no man) qui faciat miraculum (which doeth a miracle) in nomine meo (in my name), et possit simul male loqui de me (and can lightly speak evil of me).</p>
<p>40 Qui non est adversus nos, pro nobis est (For he that is not against us is on our part).</p>
<p>41 Quicumque autem potaverit vos calicem aquae (Whosoever shall give you a cup of water) in nomine meo, quia Christi estis (because ye belong to Christ), amen dico vobis, non perdet mercedem suam (verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward).</p>
<p>42 Et quicumque scandalizaverit unum ex hujusmodi parvulis (And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones), qui in me credunt (that believe in me), melius erit ei, si ligatum esset (it were better for him) molarem asinorum (an assâ€™s millstone) in collo suo, et in mare projiceretur (and were cast into the sea).</p>
<p>43 Si scandalizat te manus tua (If thy hand offend thee), amputa illam (cut it off): bonum est tibi claudum intrare in vitam (it is better for thee to enter into life maimed), quam duas manus habentem abire in gehennam (than having two hands to go into hell).</p>
<p>44 Ubi vermis eorum non moritur (Where their worm dieth not), et ignis non extinguitur (and the fire is not quenched).</p>
<p>45 Si pes tuus scandalizat te (And if thy foot offend thee), amputa illum (cut it off): bonum est tibi claudum intrare in vitam (it is better for thee to enter into life halt), quam duos pedes habentem mitti in gehennam (than having two feet to be cast into hell).</p>
<p>46 Ubi vermis eorum non moritur (Where their worm dieth not), et ignis non extinguitur (and the fire is not quenched).</p>
<p>47 Si oculus tuus scandalizat te (And if thine eye offend thee), eice illum (pluck it out): bonum est tibi luscum intrare in regnum Dei (it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God), quam duos oculos habentem mitti in gehennam ignis (than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire).</p>
<p>48 Ubi vermis eorum non moritur (Where their worm dieth not), et ignis non extinguitur (and the fire is not quenched).</p>
<p>49 Omnia enim sale salientur (For every one shall be salted with fire), et omnis sacrificium sale salietur (and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt).</p>
<p>50 Bonum est sal (Salt is good): sed si sal evanuerit (but if the salt have lost his saltness), quo condietis eum (wherewith will ye season it)? Habete in vobis sal (Have salt in yourselves), et pacem habete inter vos (and have peace one with another).</p>
