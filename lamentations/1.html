                    <p>How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of populus, how is she become as a vidua, she that was great among the gentes, and princess among the provinciae, how is she become tributaria.</p>
<p>She weepeth sore in the nocte, and her lacrimae are on her cheeks: among all her amantes she hath none to solacium her: all her amici have dealt deceitfully with her, they are become her inimici.</p>
<p>Iudaea is gone into captivitas because of afflictio, and multitudo of servitium: she dwelleth among the gentes, she findeth no requies: all her persecutores have taken her in medio of angustia.</p>
<p>The viae of Sion mourn, because none come to the festa: all her portae are desolate: her sacerdotes sigh, her virgines are in maeror, and she is in amaritudo.</p>
<p>Her inimici are become the caput, her hostes prosper; for the Domine hath afflicted her for the multitudo of her iniquitates: her parvuli are gone into captivitas before the facies of the persecutor.</p>
<p>And from the filia of Sion all her decorus is departed: her principes are become like cervi that find no pascua, they are gone without fortitudo before the facies of the persecutor.</p>
<p>Ierusalem hath remembered the dies of her paupertas and contemptus: all her desiderabilia that she had from the dies of antiquitas, when her populus cecidit in manu of the inimicus, and there was none to adiuvare her: the adversarii viderunt her, and deriserunt in sabbatis suis.</p>
<p>Ierusalem hath peccatum graviter, propterea she is become sordida: all who honored her despiciunt eam, because they viderunt her ignominiam: yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward.</p>
<p>Her immunditia is in her vestibus, she hath not remembered her finem: therefore she is cast down wonderfully, she hath no consolator: O Domine, vide afflictionem meam, quia inimicus is magnified.</p>
<p>The manus of the inimicus is magnified upon all her desiderabilia: for she hath seen the gentes entering into her sanctuarium, whom tu commandedst not to introire in ecclesia tua.</p>
<p>All her populus sigheth, requiring panem: they have given their desiderabilia for cibus to restore animam: vide, Domine, and consider, quia I am become vilis.</p>
<p>O all ye who transitis per viam, attendite, and vide, if there be dolor sicut dolor meus, quae data est mihi, quia the Domine hath afflicted me in die of furor suo.</p>
<p>From above hath he sent ignem into my ossa, and it hath dominatus: he hath extended laqueum for my pedes, he hath converted me back: he hath made me desolatam and languidam tota die.</p>
<p>The yoke of my iniquitates is bound by his manus: they are wreathed, and come up upon my collum: he hath made my fortitudo cedere, the Domine hath delivered me into manus of them that I am not able to resist.</p>
<p>The Domine hath rejected all my fortes that were in medio of me: he hath called festum against me, to destroy all my iuvenes: the Domine hath trodden the virginiem of Iudaea like in a torcular.</p>
<p>For these I weep, mine oculus, mine oculus runneth down with aqua, because the consolator that should restore animam meam is procul from me: my parvuli are desolati, because inimicus is magnified.</p>
<p>Sion spreadeth forth her manus, and there is none to consolari eam: the Domine hath commanded concerning Iacob, that his circumscribentes should be round about him: Ierusalem is as a menstruosa in medio of them.</p>
<p>The Domine is iustus; for I have rebelled against his os: hear, I pray you, all populi, and vide my dolor: my virgines and my iuvenes are gone into captivitas.</p>
<p>I called for my amantes, but they deceived me: my sacerdotes and my seniores expired in civitate, while they require cibus to restore animam.</p>
<p>Vide, Domine, for I am in angustia: my venter is in ardor, and my cor is turned within me; for I have grievously rebelled: abroad the gladius bereaveth, at home there is similis mortis.</p>
<p>They have heard that I sigh, but there is none to consolari me: all mine inimici have heard of my malum, they are glad that thou hast done it: thou hast brought the dies of festa, they are become similis to me.</p>
<p>All her peccata are before me, and her iniquitates I have not covered: and she hath done these abominationes in medio of me, that I should remove her from before my facies.</p>
<p>For the voice of the clamor is heard out of Sion, How are we desolati, we are greatly confusus, because we have derelicta the terra, because our domus are destroyed.</p>
<p>Who hath spoken, and they came to pass, when the Domine did not command them?</p>
<p>Out of the os of the Altissimus proceedeth not malum and bonum?</p>
<p>Why doth a vivus man murmur, a vir against the afflictio of his peccata?</p>
<p>Let us search our vias, and examine, and return to the Domine.</p>
<p>Let us lift up our cor with manus to the Deus in caelis.</p>
<p>We have transgressed and rebelled, thou hast not pardoned.</p>
<p>Thou hast covered us with indignatio, and pursued us with ira.</p>
<p>Thou hast set our pedes in a trabecula, and our vias thou hast made in tenebris.</p>
<p>Thou hast made us as oves to the gladio, and hast dispersed us among the gentes.</p>
<p>Thou hast vendited thy populus without pecunia, and hast not increased pretium.</p>
<p>Thou hast made us a reproach to our vicinis, a subsannatio and a derisio to them that are round about us.</p>
<p>Thou hast made us a proverb and a fabula among the gentes, a subsannatio and a derisio among the populi.</p>
<p>All our dies are in thy facies, and our iniquitates, as it were, in luce, to consider them.</p>
<p>These are the inimici, that have devorated us, and have oppressed us, and have taken our hereditas.</p>
<p>We have erred from via, we have walked in semitis, and have not walked in via of the Domine.</p>
<p>Our vestia are not caloris, as in the dies of antiquitas, when he that persecuted us was at our porta.</p>
<p>The gentes have hereditatem nostram, which we and our patres have labored for, from our iuventute even until hodie.</p>
<p>We have served regibus, because there is no rex, and our Deum we have not served, and therefore he hath delivered us into manus of our inimici.</p>
<p>They give our cibus for argentum, and our thesaurus for potus, and we must restore animam.</p>
<p>The Aegyptii also have dominatus over us, and have vendited us for argentum, and we have not been redeemed, and the Domine hath not freed us.</p>
<p>We have devoratus our manus for cibus to restore animam, and there is none to liberare us from the manus of the oppressores.</p>
<p>They have suspensus our parvuli in ligno, and our virgines in aere, and our seniores in ferro.</p>
<p>And they have taken our iuvenes to molere, and our filii in ligno, and our filiae in aere.</p>
<p>And they have devoratus our oves, and our boves, and our asini, and our camelos, and our equos, and our mulos, and our asinos, and our pecora, and our armenta, and our thesaurus.</p>
