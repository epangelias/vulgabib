  "To the chief Musician, A Psalm and Song of David. Deus, Deus meus, erigo mane, et expecto te, because thou hast been my help, and in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice.",
  "My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O Lord; in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.",
  "For thou art not a Deus of voluptas, therefore shall not the prince of malum dwell in thee.",
  "The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of iniquitas.",
  "Thou shalt destroy them that speak mendacium: the Lord will abhor the sanguinarius and deceitful man.",
  "But as for me, I will come into thy domus in the multitude of thy misericordia: and in thy reverentia will I worship toward thy sanctuarium.",
  "Lead me, O Lord, in thy iustitia because of mine inimicus; make thy via straight before my face.",
  "For there is no veritas in their os; their interiora are very wickedness; their fauces are an open sepulchre; they flatter with their lingua.",
  "Destroy them, O Deus; let them fall by their own labia: cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee.",
  "And let all those that put their fiducia in thee rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy Nomen be joyful in thee.",
  "For thou, Lord, wilt bless the iustus; with favorem wilt thou compass him as with a scutum.",
  "O Lord, thou hast heard the desiderium of the humilis: thou wilt prepare their cor, thou wilt cause thine aurem to hear:",
  "To judge the fatherless and the oppressus, that the vir terrae may no more afflict them."
