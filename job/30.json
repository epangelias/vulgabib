  "But now they that are younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the canes of my flock.",
  "Yea, whereto might the strength of their hands profit me, in whom old age was perished?",
  "For want and famine they were solitary; fleeing into the wilderness in former times desolate and waste.",
  "Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots for their meat.",
  "They were driven forth from among men, (they cried after them as after a thief;)",
  "To dwell in the clifts of the valleys, in caves of the earth, and in the rocks.",
  "Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were gathered together.",
  "They were children of fools, yea, children of base men: they were viler than the earth.",
  "And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword.",
  "They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face.",
  "Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me.",
  "Upon my right hand rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they raise up against me the ways of destruction.",
  "They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper.",
  "They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters: in the desolation they rolled themselves upon me.",
  "Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare passeth away as a cloud.",
  "And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me.",
  "My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest.",
  "By the great force of my disease is my garment changed: it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.",
  "He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes.",
  "I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou regardest me not.",
  "Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me.",
  "Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride upon it, and dissolvest my substance.",
  "For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house of apparere, where the receptaculum of all living.",
  "Yet hath he not stretched out his hand to the receptaculum of the poor; therefore I will not conceal his words.",
  "Did not he that made me in the uterus make him? and did not the same One fashion us in the womb?",
  "My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.",
  "My harp also is turned to mourning, and my organum into the voice of them that weep.",
  "I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.",
  "I went out of the porta of my house to take my viam, I considered my finem.",
  "My steps are measured, and my hope is shortened, and the way of my desire is taken from me.",
  "My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a torrent, and as the transitorius of the torrents they pass away;",
  "Which are blackish by reason of the ice, and wherein the snow hideth itself:",
  "What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.",
  "The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish.",
  "The paths of the Arabs are such, who seek to obtain the aurum of Sheba;",
  "They go up into the torrent, they search the flumen:",
  "They return at the tempus of the year, they go to the place of the petra, and find it not;",
  "They return with their manus vacuae, they hang down their heads.",
  "Shall they that go by the via of these things trust in a relictum of the flumen?",
  "Forsooth the terra is given into the manus of the wicked: he covereth the facies of the judices thereof; if not, where, and who is he?"
