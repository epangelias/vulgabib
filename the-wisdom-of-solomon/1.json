  "Love righteousness, ye that be judges of the earth: think of the Lord with a good heart, and in simplicity of heart seek Him.",
  "For He made us, and when He saw our adoration, He chose us.",
  "For in wisdom must all things be governed: and prudential judgment understandeth justice, and is always before her.",
  "She hath given to holy souls excellent wisdom, and hath seen the righteous and hath loved them.",
  "She is more beautiful than the sun, and above all the order of stars: compared to the light, she is found beforehand.",
  "For after this cometh night: but vice shall be destroyed at the light, and the wickedness of ignorance, when that is come which is sensible.",
  "For the unwise were persuaded by the subtleties of the wicked, and were deceived.",
  "For they have not known the ways of the Lord, nor the things that of Him: neither have they understood the distribution of gifts, nor the glory of His name.",
  "Give ear, ye that be unwise, and ye that are foolish, and ye that are unlearned, and covet wisdom, and instruct your souls.",
  "For the mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue talketh of judgment."
