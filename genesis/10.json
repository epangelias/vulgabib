  "And the sons of Noe, going out of the arca, were Sem, Ham, and Japheth. And Ham is the pater of Chanaan.",

  "And the filii of Japheth: Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.",
  "And the filii of Gomer: Aschkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.",

  "The filii of Ham: Chus, and Misraim, and Put, and Chanaan.",
  "And the filii of Chus: Saba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtecha. And the filii of Raamah: Seba, and Dedan.",
  "And Chus begat Nimrod: qui coepit esse potens in terra.",
  "He was a venator before the Domino: wherefore it is said: sicut Nimrod venator before the Domino.",

  "And Dase, between Ninive and Chalach: this is the great civitas.",
  "And Misraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim:",

  "And the Aradian, and the Samarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward the families of the Chanaanite were spread abroad.",
  "And the border of the Chanaanite was from Sidon, as thou goest to Gerar, unto Gaza: as thou goest to Sodoma, and Gomorra, and Adama, and Seboim, unto Lesa.",
  "These are the filii of Ham, according to their families, and their linguae, in their terrae, and in their gentibus."
