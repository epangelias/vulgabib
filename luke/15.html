                    <p>Then drew near unto him all the publicani and sinners for to hear him.</p>
<p>And the pharisaei and scribes murmured, saying, This Homo is a friend of publicani and peccatores and eateth with them.</p>
<p>And he spake this similitudo unto them, saying,</p>
<p>What Homo of you, having an hundred oves, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the nonaginta novem in the deserts, and go after that which is lost, until he find it?</p>
<p>And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his humerus with joy.</p>
<p>And coming home, he calleth together his friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my ovem which was lost.</p>
<p>I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in caelo over one peccator that repenteth, more than over nonaginta novem iusti, qui non opus habent paenitentia.</p>
<p>Either what Mulier having denaria ten, if she lose one piece, doth not light a lucerna, and sweep the domus, and seek diligently till she find it?</p>
<p>And when she hath found it, she calleth her amicae and vicinae, saying, Rejoice with me; for I have found the drachmam which I had lost.</p>
<p>Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the sight of the Angeli of Deus over one peccator that repenteth.</p>
<p>And he said, A certain Homo had duo filii,</p>
<p>And the iunior of them said to the pater, Pater, give me the pars of the substantia that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his viventia.</p>
<p>And not many dies after, the iunior son gathered all together, and took his journey into a terra remotissima, and there wasted his substantia with vivere luxuriose.</p>
<p>And when he had spent all, there arose a magnus fames in illo terra; and he began to be in egestate.</p>
<p>And he went and joined himself to one of the cives of that terra; and he sent him into his ager to feed sues.</p>
<p>And he would fain have filled his venter with the siliquae, that the sues did eat: and no Homo gave unto him.</p>
<p>And when he came to himself, he said, How many mercennarii of my pater's domus have panem in abundantia, and I perish here with famis!</p>
<p>I will arise and go to my pater, and will say unto him, Pater, I have peccatum against caelum, and before thee,</p>
<p>And am no more worthy to be called thy filius: make me as one of thy mercennarii.</p>
<p>And he arose, and came to his pater. But when he was yet a long way off, his pater saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.</p>
<p>And the filius said unto him, Pater, I have peccatum against caelum, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy filius.</p>
<p>But the pater said to his servus, Bring forth the vestimentum primum, the best: and put it on him; and put an anulus on his manus, and calceamenta on his pedes:</p>
<p>And bring hither the vitulus pinguis, and kill it; and let us eat, and make bonum festum:</p>
<p>For this my filius was mortuus, and is vivus again; he was perditus, and is inventus. And they began to festinare.</p>
<p>Now his filius major was in agro; and as he came, and approached to the domus, he heard symphoniae, et chori.</p>
<p>And he called one of the pueri, and asked what these things meant.</p>
<p>And he said unto him, Thy frater is venit; and thy pater hath killed the vitulus pinguis, because he hath received him salvum.</p>
<p>And he was iratus, and would not introire: therefore came his pater out, and entreated him.</p>
<p>And he answering said to his pater, Lo, these many annos do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy mandata: and yet thou never gavest me a caprum, that I might make festum with my amici:</p>
<p>But as soon as this thy filius was venit, which hath devoured thy substantia with meretrices, thou hast killed for him the vitulus pinguis.</p>
<p>And he said unto him, Son, thou art semper with me, and omne quod est meum est tuum.</p>
<p>It was meet that we should make festum, and be bonum animo; for this thy frater was mortuus, and is vivus; and was perditus, and is inventus.</p>
