                    <p>The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the dies of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. </p>
<p>Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O terra, for the Lord hath spoken, I have nourished and brought up filii, and they have rebelled against me. </p>
<p>The bovem knoweth his owner, and the asinus his master's crib: but Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider. </p>
<p>Ah sinful gens, laden with iniquitates, semen of evildoers, filii that deal corruptly: they have forsaken the Lord, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto indignation, and turned their backs unto him. </p>
<p>Why should ye be beaten any more? ye will revolt more and more: the whole caput is sick, and the whole cor is faint. </p>
<p>From the planta pedis unto the caput, there is no sanitas in it, but wounds and livores and recentes plagae, not bound up, nor dressed, nor softened with oleum. </p>
<p>Your terra is desolate, your civitates are burnt with ignis, your terra strangers devour before your faces, and it is desolate as when overthrown by strangers. </p>
<p>And the filia of Sion shall be left as a tabernaculum in a vineyard, as a watch-tower in a hortus cucumerum, as a besieged civitas. </p>
<p>Except the Lord of the exercitus had left us a reliquias, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like Gomorrah. </p>
<p>Hear the word of the Lord, ye princes of Sodom, give ear unto the lex of our God, ye people of Gomorrah. </p>
<p>To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrificia unto me? saith the Lord: I am full of the holocausta of arietum, and the pinguedo of edomites, and I delight not in the sanguis of boves, or of agni, or of capri. </p>
<p>When ye venite to apparere before me, who hath required this de manu vestra, that ye should venite in my atria? </p>
<p>Offer no more oblationes in vain: incensum is abomination unto me; novilunium, and sabati, the convocation I will not endure, for your novilunia and your stationes, the iniquity of your conventicula. </p>
<p>Your novilunia and your solemnities my animus hateth: they are a burthen unto me; I am weary to bear them. </p>
<p>And when ye extend manus, I will hide my oculi from you; yea, when ye make multiplicatio orationis, I will not hear: for manus vestrae sunt sanguinolentae. </p>
<p>Cleanse your manus before me, and abstain from sanguis: learn to do bonum, seek judicium, relieve the oppressus, judicate the pupillus, defende the vidua. </p>
<p>Venite now, and rationem with me, saith the Lord: if your peccata be as coccinus, they shall be made albus as nix; if they be rubri as sanguis, they shall be albus as lana. </p>
<p>If ye volueritis, and obediueritis, ye shall eat the bonum of the terra: But if ye refuse and obtemperaveritis not, ye shall be devorati gladio: for the os of the Lord hath spoken it. </p>
