                    <p>Since our Lord and Master Jesus Christ willed the entire life of believers to be one of repentance, He willed that the entire life of believers be one of repentance.</p>
<p>It is impossible for those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, and have shared in the Holy Spirit, to be brought back to repentance, as long as they themselves are crucifying again the Son of God and holding Him up to contempt, as it were, by their own culpa.</p>
<p>They are the ones who are hearing, but not understanding, are seeing, but not perceiving, as it is written: "Make the heart of this people callous, make their ears dull and close their eyes, otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their heart, and be converted, and I would heal them."</p>
