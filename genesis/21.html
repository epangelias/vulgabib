                    <p>And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken.</p>
<p>For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a filius in his senectus: and to the tempus appointed of God which he had promised him.</p>
<p>And Abraham called the nomen of his filius that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.</p>
<p>And Abraham circumcised his filius Isaac being eight dies old, as God had commanded him.</p>
<p>And Abraham was centum years old, when his filius Isaac was born unto him.</p>
<p>And Sarah said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given suck to pueri? for I have borne him a filius in his senectus.</p>
<p>And the puer grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great festum the same die.</p>
<p>And Sarah saw the filius of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, deridere.</p>
<p>Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this ancilla and her filius: for the filius of this ancilla shall not be heir with my filius, even with Isaac.</p>
<p>And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his filius.</p>
<p>And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the puer, and because of thy servus: in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her vox: for in Isaac shall thy semen be called.</p>
<p>And also of the filius of the ancilla will I make a gens, because he is thy semen.</p>
<p>And Abraham rose up early in the mane, and took bread, and a bottle of aqua, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the puer, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the desert of Beersheba.</p>
<p>And the aqua was spent in the bottle, and she cast the puer under one of the shrubs.</p>
<p>And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the puer die: and she sat down over against him, and lift up her vox, and wept.</p>
<p>And God heard the vox of the puer; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of caelum, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the vox of the puer where he is.</p>
<p>Arise, take up the puer, and hold him in thy manus; for I will make him a great gens.</p>
<p>And God opened her oculi, and she saw a puteus of aqua; and she went, and filled the bottle with aqua, and gave the puer a potum.</p>
<p>And God was with the puer; and he grew, and dwelt in the desert, and became an arcarius.</p>
<p>And he dwelt in the desert of Paran: and his mater took him a uxor out of the terra of Egypt.</p>
<p>And it came to pass at that tempus, that Abimelech and Phichol the prince of his exercitus spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:</p>
<p>Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my semen, nor with my posteritas; but according to the clementia that I have shewed thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the terra wherein thou hast sojourned.</p>
<p>And Abraham said, I will swear.</p>
<p>And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a puteus of aqua, which Abimelech's servi had violently taken away.</p>
<p>And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to die.</p>
<p>And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a foedus.</p>
<p>Thus they made a foedus at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the prince of his exercitus, and they returned into the terra of the Philistines.</p>
<p>And Abraham planted a nemus in Beersheba, and called there on the nomen of the LORD, the eternal Deus.</p>
<p>And Abraham sojourned in the terra of the Philistines many dies.</p>
