  "Behold, a King shall reigne in iustitia, and princes shall rule in iudicium.",
  "For the terre shall be filled with scientia of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.",
  "The ouvert and the secret places shall not be hid from the Lord, for his oculus shall be upon them for ever.",
  "Blessed are ye that semente iustitia, which shall reap in iustitia, and whose oculus beholdeth the Lord.",
  "And my populus shall dwell in tabernaculum pacis, and in habitaculis fiducia, and in quies tranquillitas.",
  "O filii Sion, be glad and rejoice in the Lord your Deus, for he hath given you a benediction of annus abundans.",
  "Lo, the Lord shall come with fortitudo, and his brachium shall rule for him, behold his merces with him, and his operae before him.",
  "Qui timetis the Lord, wait for him, and your oculus shall see his salus, and your aures shall hear of his laus.",
  "The desiderium of the righteous shall be given, and the brachium of the wicked shall be broken.",
  "For behold, the Lord shall come to iudicare terram, and to arguere orbem terre, and to redarguere impium in iustitia sua, and to corripere impium in furore suo.",
  "Qui ambulat iuste, et loquitur recte, et odit avaritiam, and spuit rapinam, and dimittit manus suas ab omni munere injuste.",
  "His manus non sunt extentae ad munera injusta, and non accepit munus in conspectu suo, qui facit ista non movebitur in aeternum.",
  "Be glad, O filia Sion, and be exsulte, O filia Ierusalem, for behold thy King venit in iustitia, and salvus, he shall send forth iudicium and iustitia.",
  "The ouvert and the secret places shall not be hid from the King, for his oculus shall be upon them for ever.",
  "The populus non timebit, nec timore afficetur, quia in te credimus, Deus noster, et nomen tuum invocamus, et annuntiamus inter gentes magnalia tua.",
  "For the terre shall be filled with scientia of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea."
