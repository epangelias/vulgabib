                    <p>And there was war in caelum: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,</p>
<p>And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in caelum.</p>
<p>And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Diabolus, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole mundus: he was cast out into the terra, and his angels were cast out with him.</p>
<p>And I heard a loud vox saying in caelum, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our Deus, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our Deus day and night.</p>
<p>And they overcame him by the sanguis of the Agnus, and by the verbum of their testimonium: and they loved not their anima unto the death.</p>
<p>Therefore rejoice, ye caeli, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the terra and of the mare! for the Diabolus is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short tempus.</p>
<p>And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the terra, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the male child.</p>
<p>And to the woman were given two wings of a great aquila, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a tempus, and tempus, and half a tempus, from the face of the serpent.</p>
<p>And the serpent cast out of his os mouth water as a flumen after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flumen.</p>
<p>And the terra helped the woman, and the terra opened her os, and swallowed up the flumen which the dragon cast out of his os.</p>
<p>And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of Deus, and have the testimonium of Iesus Christ.</p>
