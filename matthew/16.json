  "Then the Pharisees and Sadducees came, and tempting, desired him that he would show them a signo from heaven.",
  "He answered and said unto them, When it is vesper, ye say, It will be serenum weather: for the sky is rubicund.",
  "And in the morning, It will be procella to day: for the sky is rubiginous. O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the faciem of the sky; but can ye not signa of the tempora?",
  "A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a signo, and there shall no signo be given unto it, but the signo of Jonas the prophet. And he left them, and departed.",
  "And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take panem.",
  "Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the fermentum of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.",
  "And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have taken no panem.",
  "Which when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little fides, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no panem?",
  "Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the quinque panes of the quinque milia, and how many sportae ye took up?",
  "Neither the septem panes of the quattuor milia, and how many sportae ye took up?",
  "How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you concerning panem, that ye should beware of the fermentum of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?",
  "Then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the fermentum of panis, but of the doctrina of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.",
  "When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do homines say that I the Son of man am?",
  "And they said, Some say that thou art Ioannes the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Ieremias, or one of the prophetas.",
  "He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?",
  "And Simon Petrus answered and said, Thou art Christus, the Filius Dei vivi.",
  "Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no homo that he was Iesus the Christus.",
  "From that time forth began Iesus to shew unto his disciples, how that he must go unto Ierusalem, and suffer many res from the seniores and chief sacerdotes and scribae, and be killed, and be raised again the third die.",
  "Then Petrus took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Domine, propitius sit tibi: this shall not be unto thee.",
  "But he turned, and said unto Petrus, Get thee behind me, Satanas: thou art an offendiculum unto me: for thou savourest not the res that be of Deum, but those that be of homines.",
  "Then said Iesus unto his disciples, If any homo will come after me, let him abnegare seipsum, and take up his crucem, and follow me.",
  "For whosoever will save his anima, shall lose it: and whosoever shall lose his anima for my sake, shall find it.",
  "For what is a homo profited, if he shall gain the mundus universus, and lose his anima? or what shall a homo give in exchange for his anima?",
  "For the Filius hominis shall come in the gloria of his Pater, with his angelis; and then he shall render unto every homo according to his opera.",
  "Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste mortem, till they see the Filius hominis coming in his regnum."
