  "The heavens declare the gloria Dei; and the firmament sheweth his handywork.",
  "Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth scientia.",
  "There is no speech nor language, where their vox is not heard.",
  "Their linea is gone out through all the terra, and their words to the end of the mundus. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sol.",
  "Which is as a sponsus coming out of his thalamus, and rejoiceth as a fortis to run a cursus.",
  "His going forth is from the extremity of coelum, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the calor thereof.",
  "The lex of the Domini is perfect, converting the anima: the testimonium of the Domini is sure, making sapient the simplex.",
  "The statuta of the Domini are recta, rejoicing the cor: the mandatum of the Domini is lucidum, illuminating the oculus.",
  "The timor of the Domini is purus, remaining for ever: the judicia of the Domini are vera, and justa.",
  "More to be desired are they than aurum, yea, than much fine aurum: sweeter also than mel, and the honeycomb.",
  "Moreover by them is thy servus monitus: and in keeping of them there is magna retributio.",
  "Who can understand his errores? Purge me from occultis, Domine.",
  "Keep back thy servum also from superbias: let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be perfect, and I shall be innocent from the magna transgressio.",
  "Let the words of my os, and the meditation of my cor, be acceptable in thy sight, Domine, my fortitudo, and my redemptor."
