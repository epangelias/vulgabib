                    <p>1 And it came to pass, when men began to multiplicare innumerabilis upon the face of the terra, and filiae were born unto them,</p>
<p>2 That the filii Dei saw the filiae of homines that they were pulchrae; and they took them wives of all which they chose.</p>
<p>3 And the Dominus said, My spiritus shall not always contend with homo, for that he also is caro: yet his dies shall be an hundred and twenty annus.</p>
<p>4 There were gigantes in the terra in those dies; and also after that, when the filii Dei came in unto the filiae of homines, and they bare filii to them, the same became mightiemnes of old, men of fama.</p>
<p>5 And the Dominus saw that the malitia of homo was magnus in the terra, and that every imaginatio of the thoughts of his cor was only malum continually.</p>
<p>6 And it repented the Dominus that he had made homo in the terra, and it grieved him at the cor.</p>
<p>7 And the Dominus said, I will destroy homo whom I have created from the facies of the terra; both homo, and beast, and the reptilia, and the volucres of the caelum; for it repenteth me that I have made them.</p>
<p>8 But Noah found gratia in the oculi of the Dominus.</p>
<p>9 These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a iustus homo and perfectus in his generation, and Noah walked with Deo.</p>
<p>10 And Noah begat three filii, Sem, Cham, and Japheth.</p>
<p>11 The terra also was corrupta before Deo; and the terra was replenished with violentia.</p>
<p>12 And Deo looking upon the terra, and, behold, it was corrupta; for all caro had corrupted his via upon the terra.</p>
<p>13 And Deo said unto Noah, The end of all caro is come before me; for the terra is replenished with violentia through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the terra.</p>
<p>14 Make thee an arca of lignum of gofer; rooms shalt thou make in the arca, and shalt pitch it within and without with bitumen.</p>
<p>15 And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the arca shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the altitude of it thirty cubits.</p>
<p>16 A window shalt thou make to the arca, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the arca shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.</p>
<p>17 And, behold, I, even I, do bring a diluvium of aqua upon the terra, to destroy all caro, wherein is the spiritus of vita, from under the caelum; and every thing that is in the terra shall die.</p>
<p>18 But with thee will I establish my foedus; and thou shalt enter into the arca, thou, and thy filii, and thy uxor, and the uxores of thy filii with thee.</p>
<p>19 And of every living thing of all caro, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the arca, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.</p>
<p>20 Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the terra after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.</p>
<p>21 And take thou unto thee of all cibus that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for cibus for thee, and for them.</p>
<p>22 Thus did Noah; according to all that Deo commanded him, so did he.</p>
<p>23 And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Sem, Cham, and Japheth.</p>
<p>24 And the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.</p>
<p>25 And Sem lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat Arphaxad:</p>
<p>26 And Sem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat filii and filiae.</p>
<p>27 And Arphaxad lived thirty-five years, and begat Salah:</p>
<p>28 And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years, and begat filii and filiae.</p>
<p>29 And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:</p>
<p>30 And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat filii and filiae.</p>
<p>31 And Eber lived thirty-four years, and begat Peleg:</p>
<p>32 And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat filii and filiae.</p>
<p>33 And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:</p>
<p>34 And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat filii and filiae.</p>
<p>35 And Reu lived thirty-two years, and begat Serug:</p>
<p>36 And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat filii and filiae.</p>
<p>37 And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:</p>
<p>38 And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat filii and filiae.</p>
<p>39 And Nahor lived twenty-nine years, and begat Terah:</p>
<p>40 And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years, and begat filii and filiae.</p>
<p>41 And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.</p>
<p>42 And Haran begat Lot.</p>
<p>43 And Haran died before his pater Terah in the terra of his nativitas, in Ur of the Chaldees.</p>
<p>44 And Abram and Nahor took them uxores: the name of Abram's uxor was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's uxor, Milcah, the filia of Haran, the pater of Milcah, and the pater of Iscah.</p>
<p>45 And Sarai was sterilis; she had no filium or filia.</p>
<p>46 And Terah took Abram his filius, and Lot the filius of Haran his filius filius, and Sarai his nurus, his filius' uxor; and they went forth with him from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the terra of Chanaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.</p>
<p>47 And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.</p>
