                    <p>Now concerning spiritual donum, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.</p>
<p>Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these muta idols, even as ye were led.</p>
<p>Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of Deus, calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is Dominus, but by the Holy Spiritus.</p>
<p>Now there are diversitates dona, but the same Spiritus.</p>
<p>And there are diversitates ministeria, but the same Dominus.</p>
<p>And there are diversitates operationes, but it is the same Deus, which worketh all in all.</p>
<p>But the manifestatio of the Spiritus is given to every man to profit withal.</p>
<p>For to one is given by the Spiritus the word of sapientia; to another the word of scientia by the same Spiritus;</p>
<p>To another fides by the same Spiritus; to another dona sanitatis by the same Spiritus;</p>
<p>To another operatio potentia; to another prophetia; to another discretio spirituum; to another genera linguarum; to another interpretatio linguarum:</p>
<p>But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spiritus, dividing to every man severally as he will.</p>
<p>For as the corpus is one, and hath many membra, and all the membra of that one corpus, being many, are one corpus: so also is Christ.</p>
<p>For by one Spiritus are we all baptized into one corpus, whether we be Iudaei or Gentiles, whether we be servi or liberi; and have been all made to drink into one Spiritus.</p>
<p>For the corpus is not one membrum, but many.</p>
<p>If the pes shall say, Because I am not manus, I am not of the corpus; is it therefore not of the corpus?</p>
<p>And if the auris shall say, Because I am not oculus, I am not of the corpus; is it therefore not of the corpus?</p>
<p>If the whole corpus were oculus, where were the auditus? If the whole were auditus, where were the olfactorium?</p>
<p>But now hath Deus set the membra every one of them in the corpus, as it hath pleased him.</p>
<p>And if they were all one membrum, where were the corpus?</p>
<p>But now are they many membra, yet but one corpus.</p>
<p>And the oculus cannot say unto the manus, I have no need of thee: nor again the caput to the pedes, I have no need of you.</p>
<p>Nay, much more those membra of the corpus, which seem to be more infirma, are necessaria:</p>
<p>And those membra of the corpus, which we think to be less honesta, on these we bestow more honesta honour;</p>
<p>And our less decentia membra have more abundant decentia:</p>
<p>But our decentia membra have no need. On the other hand, Deus hath tempered the corpus together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked:</p>
<p>That there should be no schisma in the corpus; but that the membra should have the same sollicitudo one for another.</p>
<p>And whether one membrum suffer, all the membra suffer with it; or one membrum be honoured, all the membra rejoice with it.</p>
<p>Now ye are the corpus of Christ, and membra in particular.</p>
<p>And Deus hath set some in the ecclesia, first apostolos, secondarily prophetas, thirdly doctoribus, after that miracula, then dona sanitatis, helps, gubernationes, diversitates linguarum.</p>
<p>Are all apostolos? are all prophetas? are all doctoribus? are all operatores miraculorum?</p>
<p>Have all dona sanitatis? do all speak with linguarum? do all interpretare?</p>
<p>But covet earnestly the best dona: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent via.</p>
