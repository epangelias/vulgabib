  "1 The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that was the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon;",
  "2 The which Jeremiah the prophet spake unto all the people of Judah, and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, 'Hear ye the verbum of the Lord, O ye gentes of Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem;",
  "3 For thus saith the Dominus, the God of Israel, saying, Write thee all the verba that I have spoken unto thee in a libellus;",
  "4 For thus saith the Dominus, the God of Israel, unto the domus of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Hear ye the verbum of the Lord;",
  "5 Thus saith the Dominus; If ye will not hear me, to walk in my leges, which I have set before you;",
  "6 To hearken to the verba of my servus the prophets, whom I sent unto you, both rising up early, and sending them, but ye have not hearkened;",
  "7 Then will I make this domus like Shiloh, and will make this civitas a cursus;",
  "8 And I will make this civitas to be a desolatio among all the gentes of the earth;",
  "9 And I will send and take all the gentes of the north, saith the Dominus, and Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servus, and will bring them against this land, and against the inhabitants thereof, and against all these gentes round about, and will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and an hissing, and perpetual desolations;",
  "10 Moreover I will take from them the vox of mirth, and the vox of gladness, the vox of the sponsus, and the vox of the sponsa, the sound of the molae, and the lumen of the candelabrum;",
  "11 And this whole land shall be a desolatio, and an astonishment; and these gentes shall serve the king of Babylon seventy annos;",
  "12 And it shall come to pass, when seventy annos are accomplished, that I will punish the king of Babylon, and that gentem, saith the Dominus, for their iniquitas, and the land of the Chaldeans, and will make it perpetual desolations;",
  "13 And I will bring upon that land all my verba, which I have pronounced against it, even all that is written in this libellus, which Jeremiah hath prophesied against all the gentes;",
  "14 For many gentes and great reges shall serve themselves of them: yea, and I will recompense them according to their opera, and according to the works of their manus.",
  "15 For thus saith the Dominus God of Israel unto me; Take the calix of the vinum of this furor from mine manus, and cause all the gentes to whom I send thee to drink it;",
  "16 And they shall drink, and be moved, and be mad, because of the gladius that I will send among them;",
  "17 Then took I the calix from the manus of the Dominus, and made all the gentes to drink, unto whom the Dominus had sent me:",
  "18 To wit, Jerusalem, and the civitates of Judah, and the reges thereof, to make them a desolatio, an astonishment, an hissing, and a cursus;",
  "19 Pharaoh king of Egypt, and his servus, and the reges of the land of the Chaldeans, and all his gentes, and all the reges of the land of the Assyrians, and all their gentes;",
  "20 And all the reges of the land of the Zidonians, and the reges of the land of the islands which are beyond the mare;",
  "21 Edom, and Moab, and the filii of Ammon;",
  "22 And all the reges of Tyrus, and all the reges of Zidon, and the reges of the islands which are beyond the mare;",
  "23 Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all that are in the extremity;",
  "24 And all the reges of Arabia, and all the reges of the mixed people that dwell in the desert;",
  "25 And all the reges of Zimri, and all the reges of Elam, and all the reges of the Medes;",
  "26 And all the reges of the north, far and near, one with another, and all the reges of the world, which are upon the facies of the terra: and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them;",
  "27 Therefore thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Dominus of hosts, the God of Israel; Drink ye, and be drunken, and spue, and fall, and rise no more, because of the gladius which I will send among you;",
  "28 And it shall be, if they refuse to take the calix from thine manus to drink, then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the Dominus of hosts; Ye shall certainly drink;",
  "29 For, lo, I begin to bring evil on the civitas whereon my nomine is called, and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished: for I will call for a gladius upon all the inhabitants of the terra, saith the Dominus of hosts;",
  "30 Therefore prophesy thou against them all these verba, and say unto them, The Dominus shall roar from on high, and utter his vox from his sanctuarium; he shall mightily roar upon his habitatio; he shall give a shout, as they that tread the lacus, against all the inhabitants of the terra;",
  "31 The clamor shall come to the end of the terra; for the Dominus hath a controversia with the gentes, he will plead with all flesh; he will give those that are wicked to the gladius, saith the Dominus;",
  "32 Thus saith the Dominus of hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great tempest shall be raised up from the extremity of the terra;",
  "33 And the slain of the Dominus shall be at that day from one end of the terra even unto the other end of the terra: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the facies of the terra;",
  "34 Howl, ye pastors, and cry; and wallow yourselves in the ashes, ye principal of the greges: for the dies of your slaughter and of your dispersion is accomplished; and ye shall fall like a precious vas;",
  "35 And the pastors shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the greges to escape;",
  "36 A vox of the clamor of the pastors, and a howling of the principal of the greges, for the Dominus hath spoiled their pastura;",
  "37 And the pacificae habitationes are cut down because of the furor of the ira of the Dominus;",
  "38 He hath forsaken his tabernaculum, as the lyon: for their terra is desolate because of the indignatio of the ira of the Dominus."
