                    <p>The words of Amos, who was among the herdmen of Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam filius Joas regis Israel, two annis before the terraemotu which was in the days of Uzziah.</p>
<p>And he said, Dominus rugiet de Zion, and utter his vocem from Jerusalem; and the pastores tabernacula shall lament, and the summitas Carmeli shall wither.</p>
<p>Thus saith Dominus; For tres crimes of Damascus, yea for quattuor, I will not convertetur the poenam thereof; because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instrumentis ferreis.</p>
<p>And I will mittam ignem in the murus of Hazael, which shall devorare the palatia of Ben-hadad.</p>
<p>I will break also the vectis of Damascus, and extinguish the habitantem in the valley of Aven, and him that holdeth the sceptrum of the domus of Eden; and the populus of Syria shall be in captivitatem in Kir, saith Dominus.</p>
<p>Thus saith Dominus; For tres crimes of Gaza, yea for quattuor, I will not convertetur the poenam thereof; because they carried away captive the totum populus to deliver them up to Edom:</p>
<p>And I will mittam ignem in the murus of Gaza, which shall devorare the palatia thereof.</p>
<p>And I will extirpabo the habitantem of Ashdod, and him that holdeth the sceptrum of Ashkelon, and I will turn my manum against Ekron; and the remnant of the Philistinorum shall periit, saith Dominus Deus.</p>
<p>Thus saith Dominus; For tres crimes of Tyrus, yea for quattuor, I will not convertetur the poenam thereof; because they delivered up the totum populus to Edom, and remembered not the foedus fraternitatis.</p>
<p>And I will mittam ignem in the murus of Tyrus, which shall devorare the palatia thereof.</p>
<p>Thus saith Dominus; For tres crimes of Edom, yea for quattuor, I will not convertetur the poenam thereof; because he pursued his fratrem with gladio, and did cast off all pietas, and his ira did tear perpetuo, and he kept his furor perpetuo.</p>
<p>And I will mittam ignem in Teman, which shall devorare the palatia of Bozrah.</p>
<p>Thus saith Dominus; For tres crimes of the filii Ammon, yea for quattuor, I will not convertetur the poenam thereof; because they have ripped up the praegnantem of Gilead, that they might amplificare their terminus.</p>
<p>And I will mittam ignem in the murus of Rabbah, which shall devorare the palatia thereof, with clamore in die belli, and with turbo in die proelii; and their king shall go in captivitatem, he and his principes together, saith Dominus.</p>
