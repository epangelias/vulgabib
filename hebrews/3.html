                    <p>Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly vocatio, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confessio, Jesus;</p>
<p>Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his domus;</p>
<p>For this man was counted worthy of more gloria than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath built the domus hath more honor than the domus;</p>
<p>For every domus is built by some man; but he that built all things is Deus;</p>
<p>And Moses verily was faithful in all his domus, as a servus, for a testimonium of those things which were to be spoken after;</p>
<p>But Christ as a filius over his own domus; whose domus are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end;</p>
<p>Wherefore, as the Holy Spirit saith, Today if ye will hear his vocem, Harden not your cordia, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness;</p>
<p>When your patres tempted me, proved me, and saw my opera forty years;</p>
<p>Wherefore I was grieved with that generatio, and said, They do alway err in their cor, and they have not known my ways;</p>
<p>So I sware in my ira, They shall not enter into my requiem;</p>
<p>Beware, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil cor of unbelief, in departing from the Deus vivus;</p>
<p>But exhort one another daily, while it is called To-day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of peccatum;</p>
<p>For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our fiducia stedfast unto the end;</p>
<p>While it is said, To day if ye will hear his vocem, harden not your cordia, as in the provocation.</p>
<p>For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Aegypt by Moses;</p>
<p>But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had sinned, whose cadavera fell in the wilderness?</p>
<p>And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his requiem, but to them that believed not?</p>
<p>So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.</p>
