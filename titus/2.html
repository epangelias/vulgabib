                    <p>But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:</p>
<p>That the aged men be sober, grave, temperant, sound in fide, in charity, in patience.</p>
<p>The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh sanctimonia, not false accusers, not given to much vinum, teachers of boni operis;</p>
<p>That they may teach the young women to be sobria, to love their viri, to love their filii,</p>
<p>To be discreet, chaste, keepers of the domus, bona, obedient to their viri, that the word of Deus be not blasphemed.</p>
<p>Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.</p>
<p>In all things shewing thyself a pattern of boni operis: in doctrine shewing incorruptness, gravitatem, sinceritatem,</p>
<p>Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the adversary may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of thee.</p>
<p>Exhort servants to be obedient unto their domini, and to please them well in all things; not answering again;</p>
<p>Not purloining, but shewing all bona fides; that they may adorn the doctrine of Deus our Salvator in all things.</p>
