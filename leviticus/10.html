                    <p>And Nadab and Abihu, filii Aaron, took either of them his censer, and put ignis in them, and put incensum thereon, and offered ignis alienum before the Lord, which he commanded them not.</p>
<p>And there went out ignis from the Lord, and devoravit them, and they mortui sunt before the Lord.</p>
<p>Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that the Lord spake, saying, I will be sanctificatus in them that appropinquant to me, and before all the populus I will be glorificatus. And Aaron tacebat.</p>
<p>And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, filii Uzziel uncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Accedite, take your fratres from before sanctuarium, and put them forth without castra.</p>
<p>So they went near, and put them in their tunicas, as Moses had spoken.</p>
<p>And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar, and unto Ithamar, filii eius, Capilli vestri non sint dispersi, and vestimenta vestra non sint scissa, lest you moriatis, and lest indignatio fiat upon all the congregatio: but your fratres, omnis domus Israel, plorabunt ignem quem consumpsit, and the duos filios vestros, qui mortui sunt before the Lord.</p>
<p>You shall not egredi from the ostium of the tabernaculum, lest you moriatis, for oleum unctionis Domini is upon you. And they did according to verbum Moses.</p>
<p>And the Lord spoke unto Aaron, saying, Vinum et siceram you shall not bibere, thou, and filii tui, when you intratis in tabernaculum, lest you moriatis: a perpetuo statutum in generationibus vestris.</p>
<p>And ut discernas inter sanctum et profanum, and between pollutum and mundum:</p>
<p>And ut docere possitis filios Israel omnia statuta, quae locutus est Dominus ad eos per manum Moses.</p>
