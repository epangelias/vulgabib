                    <p>O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is bonus, for his misericordia endureth for ever.</p>
<p>Let Israel now say, that his misericordia endureth for ever.</p>
<p>Let the house of Aaron now say, that his misericordia endureth for ever.</p>
<p>Let them now that fear the Lord say, that his misericordia endureth for ever.</p>
<p>In afflictione I called upon the Lord, and he answered me in latitudinem.</p>
<p>The Lord is on my side; I will not timere.</p>
<p>What can man do unto me?</p>
<p>The Lord taketh my part with them that help me; therefore shall I see my desiderium upon them that hate me.</p>
<p>It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man.</p>
<p>It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in principes.</p>
<p>All nations compassed me about, but in nomine Domini I will destroy them.</p>
<p>They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about, but in nomine Domini I will destroy them.</p>
<p>They compassed me about like apes, they are extincti with the name of the Lord.</p>
<p>They compassed me about like ignis, but in nomine Domini I will destroy them.</p>
<p>Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall, but the Lord helped me.</p>
<p>The Lord is my fortitudo and cano, and is become my salvus.</p>
<p>The voice of rejoicing and salvus is in the tabernaculis of the just.</p>
<p>The right hand of the Lord doth valere, the right hand of the Lord doth exaltatio.</p>
<p>I shall not morior, but vivam, and declarabo opera Domini.</p>
<p>The Lord hath corrected me sore, but he hath not delivered me over to mors.</p>
<p>Open to me the portae justitiae, I will go into them, and I will gratias Domino.</p>
<p>This gate of the Lord, through which justi shall enter.</p>
<p>I will gratias thee, for thou hast responded me, and art become my salvus.</p>
<p>The lapis which the aedificatores rejected, the same is become the caput anguli.</p>
<p>This is the Lord's doing, and it is mirabile in our oculis.</p>
<p>This is the dies which the Lord hath made, let us be gaudium and laetitia in it.</p>
<p>O Domine, salvum fac, o Domine, prosperare.</p>
<p>Benedictus qui venit in nomine Domini, we have blessed you out of the domus Domini.</p>
<p>Deus Dominus, et illuxit nobis, vinciamus ramum usque ad altare.</p>
<p>Tu es meus Deus, et gratias tibi ago, tu es meus Deus, et extollo te.</p>
<p>Gratias tibi ago, quoniam audisti me, et factus es mihi in salvum.</p>

<p>Vox Domini in virtute, vox Domini in magnificentia.</p>
<p>Vox Domini inter cedros, vox Domini in montibus confringentium.</p>
<p>Vox Domini in deserto, vox Domini in silva confringentium, et omnes populi dixerunt, laudate Dominum.</p>
