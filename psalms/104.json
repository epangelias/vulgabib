  "Bless the Lord, O my anima, O Lord my Deus, thou art very magnus, thou art clothed with honorem and maiestas:",
  "Who coverest thyself with lumen as with a vestis, who stretchest out the caelum like a curtain:",
  "Who layeth the trabes of his cenacula in the aquis, who maketh the nubes his currus, who walketh upon the alae of the ventus:",
  "Who maketh his angelos spiritus, his ministri ignis flamma:",
  "Who laid the fundamenta of the terra, that it should not be moved for ever:",
  "The abyssus as vestis covereth it: above the montes they are clothed with valles:",
  "At thy reprehensio they flee, at the vox of thy tonitruum they haste away:",
  "They ascendare the montes, they descendere in the valles unto the locum which thou hast fundamenta for them.",
  "Thou hast posita a terminus that they may not transgredi, that they turn not again to cover the terra:",
  "Who sendeth the fontes into the vallis, which run inter montes:",
  "They give potus to all the beastes of the ager, the onagri quench their sitis:",
  "Above them the aves of the caelum have their habitaculum, they give vocem:",
  "He watereth the montes from his cenacula, the terra is satiata from the fructus of thy opera:",
  "He causeth the herbam to grow for the pecus, and herbam servire for the usus of hominibus:",
  "That he may educere panem out of the terra, and vinum laetificare the cor of hominibus, and oleum to make the faciem of hominibus to shine, and panis to fortificare the cor of hominibus:",
  "The lignum of the Lord shall be satiata, the cedri of Libani which he hath plantata:",
  "There the passeres make their nests, the top of it is the domus of the pullus of the aquila:",
  "The montes are alta for the ibex, the petrae a refuge for the dasypus:",
  "He appointed lunam for certis temporibus, sol knoweth his occasus:",
  "Thou makest tenebrae, and it is nox, wherein all the beastes of the silva do stirre:",
  "The iuvenes of the leones roare after their praeda, and to petere their panem from Deus:",
  "The sol oritur, they congregare themselves, and in their tabernacula they se includere:",
  "Hominem goeth forth unto his opus, and to his laborare until vespera:",
  "O Lord, quomodo magnus are thy opera, in sapientia thou hast made omnia, the terra is plena of thy bonitas:",
  "There go the navis, this leviathan which thou hast fecit to ludere therein:",
  "That expectent from thee his escam, to dare their panem:",
  "That which thou givest them they congregare, thou aperis tuam manum, they are satiata of bonum:",
  "Thou hidest thy faciem, they are turbati, thou takest away their spiritus, they expire, and returnare to their pulvis:",
  "Thou sendest forth thy spiritus, they are creata, and thou renovas the faciem of the terra:",
  "Laus sit tibi, Domine, of the terra, let the voluntas of the Lord be facta, and may the Lord gaudeo in his opera:",
  "He looketh on the terra, and it trembleth, he toucheth the montes, and they fumare:",
  "I will singare to the Lord during my vita, I will psallere to my Deus while I have esse:",
  "My meditationare of him shall be dulcis, I will gaudeo in the Lord:",
  "Sinners shall be consumpti from the terra, and the iniqui shall be no more. Benedic, anima mea, Domino. Laus Domino."
