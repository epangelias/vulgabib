  "Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spirituales, restore such an one in the spirit of lenitas, considering thyself, lest thou also be temptatus.",
  "Bear ye one another's onera. For also Christ gratias agere did not to himself, but to God.",
  "For every man shall bear his own onus.",
  "Let him that is doctrinam doctus in the word, communicare in all good things with him that doctorem doth.",
  "Be not deceived; God is not ludificandus: for whatsoever a man seminat, that shall he also metere.",
  "For he that seminat in his carne, of the carne shall reap corruptio; but he that seminat in Spiritu, of the Spiritu shall reap vitam aeternam.",
  "And let us not fatigari in benefaciendo: for in tempore suo, we shall metere, if we faint not.",
  "As we therefore have occasio, let us operam dare to do bonum unto all men, especially unto those who are of the familia fidei.",
  "Ye see how large a litera I have written unto you with mine own manus.",
  "As many as desire to make a fair shew in carne, they constrain you to circumcidi, only lest they should persecutio suffer for the crucis Christi.",
  "For neither they themselves who are circumcisi keep the legem, but desire to have you circumcisi, that they may gloriari in your carne.",
  "But God forbid that I should gloriari, save in the cruce Domini nostri Iesu Christi, per quem mundus est crucifixus mihi, et ego mundo.",
  "For in Christo Iesu neither circumcisio availet aliquid, neque praeputium, sed nova creatura.",
  "And as many as walk according to this regulam, pax et misericordia super illos, et super Israel Dei.",
  "From henceforth let no man dare to me molestare: for I bear in corpore meo stigmata Domini Iesu.",
  "Brethren, the gratia Domini nostri Iesu Christi be with your spirit. Amen."
