  "Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I will raise up against Babylon, and against them that dwell in the midst of them that rise up against me, a destroyer, saith Deus.",
  "And I will send unto Babylon fanners, that shall fan her, and shall empty her terra, and make her a vasta solitudo.",
  "They shall be all slain, and consumed by gladius, he that is caught, and he that is not caught, shall fall by gladius.",
  "Ye that have escaped the gladius, go away, stand not still: remember Dominus from afar, and let Jerusalem come into your mentem.",
  "We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake her, and let us go every one into his terra: for her judicium reacheth unto caelum, and is lifted up even to nubes.",
  "The Lord hath spoiled Babylon, and hath destroyed out of her the great voice; when her waves do roar like many aquae: a noise of their voice is uttered.",
  "Because the spoiler is come upon her, even upon Babylon, and her fortes are taken, and her murus are thrown down, for it is the vindicta Domini: take your vindictas upon her; as she hath done, do unto her.",
  "Cut off the sator from Babylon, and him that handleth the falx in the tempus of the harvest: for fear of the gladius of the oppressor every one shall turn to his populus, and they shall flee every one to his terra.",
  "And the bellator, the men of war, even they had let the pacem.",
  "Because of the indignation of the Lord, she is not inhabited, but she is wholy solitudo: every one that goeth by Babylon shall be astonished, and hiss at all her plaegas.",
  "Make bright the aes, O ye that encircle the civitas, to the which the Lord, the Deus of Israel, hath spoken; Behold, I will send and take a nation from the aquilon, and they shall set themselves in array against her; she shall be taken: their sagittae are as those that destroy not, every one shall return in his fructus.",
  "Because ye were glad, because ye rejoiced, O destroyers of mine hereditas, because ye are grown grasus as the bovis at pastura, and bellow as colossi.",
  "Your mater shall be sore confounded, and she that bare you shall blush: behold, the last of gentes shall be a solitudo, a terra sine viis and montibus.",
  "And I will retribuere Babylon, and all the Chaldei her populum, for all their malum that they have done in Sion in your oculis, saith the Lord.",
  "Behold, I am against thee, O mountaine destroying the whole terra: and I will stretch out mine manum upon thee, and roll thee down from the petrae, and will make thee a montem of burning sulphur.",
  "And they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner, nor a stone for foundations; but thou shalt be desolata for ever, saith the Lord.",
  "Set ye up a signe, publish in the via, set up a ensign, direct the via of the aquilon: say, Behold, the Lord hath spoiled Babylon, he hath destroyed out of her the great voice; when her undae do roar like many aquae."
