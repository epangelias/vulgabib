                    <p>And the word of the Dominus came unto me, saying,</p>
<p>Thou shalt not make a conventio with the inhabitants of this land; they shall break down thy muri, and destroy thy civitates.</p>
<p>For they have not hearkened to my voces, saith the Dominus, to walk in my viæ, to keep my mandata, my instituta, and my iudicia, as did your patres.</p>
<p>Therefore thus saith the Dominus, Ye have not hearkened unto me, to do unto you all the beneficia, that I have proposed to beneficere you:</p>
<p>But this thing commanded I them, saying, Obey my voces, and I shall be your Deus, and ye shall be my populus; and walk ye in all the viæ that I have commanded you, that it may be bene with you.</p>
<p>Wherefore I will cause you to proficere, and do you beneficere, and will establish my foedus with you.</p>
<p>For if ye throughly amend your viæ and your studia, then will I cause you to dwel in this locus, in the terra that I gave to your patres, for ever and ever.</p>
<p>Behold, ye trust in lying words, that cannot proficere.</p>
<p>Will ye steale, murderare, and adulterare, and swear falsely, and burn incense unto Baal, and walke after other dei, whom ye know not;</p>
<p>And come and stand before me in this domus, which is called by my nomine, and say, We are delivered to libertas, that we may do all these abominationes?</p>
<p>Is this domus, which is called by my nomine, become a spelunca of latrones in your oculis? Behold, even I have seen it, saith the Dominus.</p>
<p>Go ye now unto my locus which was in Shiloh, where I set my nomine at the first, and see what I did to it for the malitia of my populus Israel.</p>
<p>And now, because ye have done all these opera, saith the Dominus, and I spake unto you, rising early and speaking, but ye heard not; and I called you, but ye answered not;</p>
<p>Therefore will I do unto this domus, which is called by my nomine, wherein ye trust, and unto the locus which I gave to you and to your patres, as I have done to Shiloh.</p>
<p>And I will cast you out of my oculus, as I have cast out all your fratres, even the semen of Ephraim.</p>
<p>Therefore pray not thou for this populus, neither lift thou up cry for them, neither make thou intercession to me: for I will not hear thee.</p>
<p>Seest thou not what they do in the civitates of Judah and in the plateis of Jerusalem?</p>
<p>The children gather wood, and the patres kindle the fire, and the mulieres knead their panem, to make cakes to the regina caeli, and to pour out drink-offerings unto other dei, that they may provoke me to ira.</p>
<p>Do they provoke me to ira? saith the Dominus: do they not provoke themselves to the confusio of their own vultus?</p>
<p>Therefore thus saith the Dominus Deus; Behold, mine ira and my furor shall be poured out upon this locus, upon homines, and upon animalia, and upon ligna of the ager, and upon fructus thereof, and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched.</p>
<p>Thus saith the Dominus of the exercitus, the Deus of Israel; Put your holocausta in the addition to your sacrificia, and eat ye carnes.</p>
<p>For I spake not unto your patres, nor commanded them in the die when I led them out of Aegyptum, concerning holocausta or sacrificia:</p>
<p>But this thing commanded I them, saying, Obey my voces, and I will be your Deus, and ye shall be my populus: and walke ye in all the viæ that I have commanded you, that it may be bene with you.</p>
<p>But they hearkened not, nor inclined their aurem, but walked in the counsels and in the imagination of their malus cor:</p>
<p>Since the die that your patres came forth out of Aegyptum unto this die, I have even sent unto you all my servos the prophetæ, rising early and sending them:</p>
<p>Yet they hearkened not unto me, nor inclined their aurem, but hardened their cervices: they did worse than their patres.</p>
<p>Therefore thou shalt speake all these verba unto them; but they will not hear thee: thou shalt also call unto them; but they will not answer thee.</p>
<p>But thou shalt say unto them, This is a gens that obeyeth not the voces of the Dominus their Deus, nor receiveth correction: veritas is perished, and is cut off from their os.</p>
<p>For the filius of the Domus Israel and the filius of the Domus Judah have dealt very perfidiosly against me, saith the Dominus.</p>
<p>They have belied the Dominus, and said, It is not he; neither shall evil come upon us; neither shall we see sword nor famine:</p>
<p>And the prophetæ shall become ventus, and the word is not in them: thus shall it be done unto them.</p>
<p>Wherefore thus saith the Dominus Deus of the exercitus, Because ye speake this verbum, behold, I will make my verba in thy os fire, and this populus wood, and it shall devour them.</p>
<p>Lo, I will bring a gens upon you from far, O domus of Israel, saith the Dominus: it is a robusta gens, it is an antiqua gens, a gens whose lingua thou knowest not, neither understandest what they say.</p>
<p>Their balistæ shall be as an aperture of sepulchra, they shall devour, and shall not spare: and they shall destroy, and shall not save; and they shall sound, as the sonus of equus; and upon the montes they shall leap, like the sonus of those that leap upon the terra;</p>
<p>We shall destroy them at once, saith the Dominus, and shall confundere the lingua of Jerusalem with the terra, and will pull down the domus of this gens, domus to domus, and their muri, one to another.</p>
<p>And I will make Jerusalem heaps, and a dens of feræ; and I will make the civitates of Judah desolate, without an habitator.</p>
<p>Who is the sapiens, that may understand this? and who is he to whom the os of the Dominus hath spoken, that he may declare it, for what the terra perisheth and is burnt up like a solitudo, that none passeth through?</p>
<p>And the Dominus saith, Because they have forsaken my legem which I set before them, and have not obeyed my voces, nor walked therein;</p>
<p>But have walked after the imagination of their cor, and after Baalim, which their patres taught them:</p>
<p>Therefore thus saith the Dominus of the exercitus, the Deus of Israel; Behold, I will feed them, even this populus, with wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink.</p>
<p>I will scatter them also among the gentes, whom neither they nor their patres have known: and I will send a gladius after them, till I have consumed them.</p>
<p>Thus saith the Dominus of the exercitus, the Deus of Israel; Go and get thee a libellus, and write in it all the verba that I have spoken unto thee against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the gentes, whom I have sent thee unto;</p>
<p>From the die that I spake unto you, rising early and speaking unto you; but thou hast not heard.</p>
<p>Then took I the libellus from the manus of the propheta, and read it: and therin were written lamentationes, and planctus, and miserias, and malæ.</p>
<p>And it came to passe, when I had read three or four pagina, I rent it, and I burnt it in the ignis: and he that held it in his manus, he trembled, and all his caro shaked:</p>
<p>And he said, O Domine Deus, thy verba are consummated, and thou hast done it.</p>
