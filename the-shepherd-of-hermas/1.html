                    <p>I was a shepherd, and after I had been released from the army, I went to my country and lived a virtuous vida.</p>
<p>I had a brother, whose name was Paul, who was in the habit of speaking to me as if he were my lord, and I loved him as I did myself, and he was faithful, and yet I was simple and innocent, and knew not the malum of the world.</p>
<p>I remained in the field a few days, and then I came to the city, and I was taken with a great enthusiasmus to see my brother, and I went to him, and we embraced each other, and he spoke to me with a loud voice, and said, 'How was it that you were not afraid in the field, when you saw the great bestia?'</p>
<p>I said to him, 'Because I am a Christianus, and I trust in the Lord, and He has given me power and strength, and I feared not the bestia.'</p>
<p>He said to me, 'It is good, but now listen to me, and I will show you the things which the Lord has revealed to me.'</p>
<p>He took me by the hand, and led me to a certain place, and showed me a great porta, and said, 'Do you see this porta?'</p>
<p>I said, 'I see it, lord.'</p>
<p>He said to me, 'This porta is the porta of vita, and every one who enters through it shall live.'</p>
<p>He showed me also a certain virgo, who was seated on the porta, and said, 'Do you see this virgo?'</p>
<p>I said, 'I see her, lord.'</p>
<p>He said to me, 'This virgo is the accidens of the Church, and she is the spiritus of vita.'</p>
