  "Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the terra, Peace be multiplied unto you.",
  "I thought it good to shew the signa and wonders that the Deus Altissimus hath wrought toward me.",
  "How great are his signa! and how mighty are his mirabilia! his regnum is an everlasting regnum, and his dominium is from generatio and generatio.",
  "I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house, and flourishing in my palatium:",
  "I saw a somnium which made me afraid, and the cogitationes upon my bed, and the visiones of my head troubled me.",
  "Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known unto me the interpretatio of the somnium.",
  "Then came in the magi, the astrologi, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers: and I told the somnium before them; but they did not make known unto me the interpretatio thereof.",
  "But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the nomen of my Deus, and in whom is the spiritus of the sancti Dei: and before him I told the somnium, saying,",
  "O Belteshazzar, master of the magi, because I know that the spiritus of the sancti Dei is in thee, and no arcanum troubleth thee, tell me the visiones of my somnium that I have seen, and the interpretatio thereof.",
  "Thus were the visiones of mine head in my bed; I saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the terra, and the height thereof was great.",
  "The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto the caelum, and the sight thereof to the end of all the terra:",
  "The folia thereof were faire, and the fructus thereof much, and in it was cibus for all: the bestiae of the field had shadow under it, and the aves of the caelum dwelt in the ramis thereof, and all caro was fed of it.",
  "I saw in the visiones of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and an holy one came down from caelum;",
  "He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off his branches, shake off his folia, and scatter his fructus: let the bestiae get away from under it, and the fowls from his branches:",
  "Nevertheless leave the stump of his radices in the terra, even with a band of ferreus and aeris, in the herba of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of caelum, and let his portio be with the bestiae in the herba of the terra:",
  "Let his cor be changed from that of a man, and let a cor of a beast be given unto him; and let seven times pass over him.",
  "This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the sancti, that the living may know that the Altissimus ruleth in the regnum of hominum, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of hominum.",
  "This somnium I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen. Now thou, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretatio thereof, forasmuch as all the wise men of my regnum cannot make known unto me the interpretatio: but thou art able; for the spiritus of the sancti Dei is in thee.",
  "Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was astonied for one hora, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spake, and said, Belteshazzar, let not the somnium, or the interpretatio thereof, trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the somnium be to them that hate thee, and the interpretatio thereof to thine enemies.",
  "The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached unto the caelum, and the sight thereof to the end of all the terra;",
  "Whose folia were faire, and the fructus thereof much, and in it was cibus for all; under which the bestiae of the field dwelt, and upon whose branches the aves of the caelum had their habitation:",
  "It is thou, O king, that art grown and become strong: for thy greatness is grown, and reacheth unto the caelum, and thy dominium to the end of the terra.",
  "And whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down from caelum, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it; yet leave the stump of the radices thereof in the terra, even with a band of ferreus and aeris, in the herba of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of caelum, and let his portio be with the bestiae of the field, until seven times pass over him;",
  "This is the interpretatio, O king, and this is the decree of the Altissimus, which is come upon my lord the king:",
  "That they shall drive thee from hominum, and thy dwelling shall be with the bestiae of the field, and they shall make thee to eat herba as oxen, and they shall wet thee with the dew of caelum, and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know that the Altissimus ruleth in the regnum of hominum, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.",
  "And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the radices of the tree; thy regnum shall be sure unto thee, after that thou shalt have known that the caeli do rule.",
  "Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and break off thy peccata by righteousness, and thine iniquitates by shewing mercy to the pauper;",
  "If it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillitas: all this shall come upon thee, after that I have seen, because that the Altissimus ruleth.",
  "All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.",
  "At the end of twelve mensium he walked in the palatium of the regnum of Babylon.",
  "The king spake, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the regnum by the might of my virtus, and for the honour of my maiestas?",
  "While the word was in the king's os, there fell a vox from caelum, saying, O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken; The regnum is departed from thee.",
  "And they shall drive thee from hominum, and thy dwelling shall be with the bestiae of the field: they shall make thee to eat herba as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou shalt know that the Altissimus ruleth in the regnum of hominum, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.",
  "The same hora was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from hominum, and did eat herba as oxen, and his cor was made like the cor of a beast, and his nails like the ungues of eagles.",
  "The time is fulfilled for him to return to his regnum, for the hominum saw that the Altissimus gave him regnum again.",
  "Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of caelum, all whose opera are veritas, and his viae iudicia: and those that walk in pride he is able to abase."
