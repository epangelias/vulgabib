                    <p>Ask ye of the LORD rain in the time of the latter ver, so the LORD shall make bright clouds, and give them showers of ver, to every one grass in the field.</p>
<p>For the idols have spoken vanity, the diviners have seen a lie, and the dreamers have spoken a fabula, they comfort in vain: therefore they went their way as a flock, they were troubled, because there was no pastor.</p>
<p>Mine ira is kindled against the pastors, and I will visit the greges by their hand. For the LORD of hosts hath visited his gregis, the house of Judah, and hath made them as his beautiful horse in the battle.</p>
<p>Out of him came forth the corner, out of him the tent peg, out of him the battle bow, out of him every oppressor together.</p>
<p>And they shall be as mighty men, which tread down their enemies in the mire of the streets in the battle: and they shall fight, because the LORD is with them, and the riders on horses shall be confounded.</p>
<p>And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph, and I will bring them again to place them; for I have mercy upon them: and they shall be as though I had not cast them off: for I am the LORD their God, and I will hear them.</p>
<p>And they of Ephraim shall be like a mighty man, and their cor shall rejoice as with vinum: yea, their filii shall see it, and be glad; their cor shall rejoice in the LORD.</p>
<p>I will hiss for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed them: and they shall increase as they have increased.</p>
<p>And I will sow them among the peoples, and they shall remember me in far countries; and they shall live with their filii, and turn again.</p>
<p>I will bring them again also out of the terra Aegypti, and gather them out of Assiria; and I will bring them into the terra Galaad, and Lebanon; and place shall not be found for them.</p>
<p>And he shall pass through the mare, with affliction, and the flumen shall be dried up: for I will dry up all the flumina of Aegyptus; and the terra shall be desolate, and laid waste, for the violentia of them that dwell therein, even from the tower of Syene shall they come thither.</p>
<p>The hand of Aegyptus shall fail in the midst of it; and the gloria of them that trust in Aegyptus shall be brought to ignominia, saith the Dominus Deus.</p>
<p>In that day shall the DOMINUS of hosts be for a coronet of gloria, and for a diadem of gloria, unto the residuum of his hereditas; for his servus the prophet, for he hath built up Zion, for he hath appeared with misericordia in his beautiful templum.</p>
