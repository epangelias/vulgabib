                    <p>And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's nomen (name) written in their frontes.</p>
<p>These are they which were not defiled with mulieres (women), for they are virgins. These are they which follow the Agnus (Lamb) whithersoever he goeth. These were redeemed from among homines (men), being the firstfruits unto Deus (God) and to the Lamb.</p>
<p>And I saw another angel flying in mid heaven, having the evangelium (gospel) æternæ (eternal) to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every natio (nation), and kinreds, and lingua (tongue), and people.</p>
<p>Saying with a loud vox (voice), Fear Deus (God), and give glory to him; for the hora (hour) of his iudicium (judgment) is come: and worship him that made caelum (heaven), and terra (earth), and mare (sea), and fontes aquarum (fountains of waters).</p>
<p>And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great civitas (city), because she made all gentes (nations) drink of the vinum (wine) of the wrath of her fornicatio (fornication).</p>
<p>And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud vox (voice), If any man worship the bestia (beast) and his imago (image), and receive his character (mark) in his frontem (forehead), or in his manus (hand),</p>
<p>The same shall drink of the vinum (wine) of the wrath of Deus (God), which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignatio (indignation); and he shall be tormented with ignis (fire) and sulphur in the praesentia (presence) of the holy angels, and in the praesentia (presence) of the Lamb:</p>
<p>And the fumus (smoke) of their torment ascendeth up in saecula saeculorum (for ever and ever): and they have no rest diem (day) nor noctem (night), who worship the bestia (beast) and his imago (image), and whosoever receiveth the character (mark) of his nomen (name).</p>
<p>Here is the patiens (patience) of the sancti (saints), here are they that keep the mandata (commandments) of Deus (God), and the fides (faith) of Iesu (Jesus).</p>
<p>And I heard a vox (voice) from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed are the mortui (dead) which die in Dominus (the Lord) from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their laboribus (labors); and their opera (works) do follow them.</p>
