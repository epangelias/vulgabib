  "Moreover the word of the Dominus came unto me, saying, Son of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy against it,",
  "And say unto it, Thus saith the Dominus Deus; Behold, O mount Seir, I am against thee, and I will stretch out mine hand against thee, and I will make thee most desolate,",
  "I will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate, and thou shalt know that I am the Dominus.",
  "Because thou hast had a perpetual hatred, and hast shed the blood of the children of Israel by the force of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time when their iniquity had an end:",
  "Therefore, as I live, saith the Dominus Deus, I will prepare thee unto blood, and blood shall pursue thee: sicut thou hast not hated blood, even blood shall pursue thee.",
  "Thus will I make mount Seir most desolate, and cut off from it him that passeth out and him that returneth.",
  "And I will fill his mountains with his slain men: in thy hills, and in thy vallis, and in all thy rivers, shall they fall that are slain with the gladius.",
  "I will make thee perpetual desolations, and thy cities shall not return, and ye shall know that I am the Dominus.",
  "Because thou hast said, These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will possess it; whereas the Dominus was there:",
  "Therefore, as I live, saith the Dominus Deus, I will even do according to thine anger, and according to thine envy which thou hast used out of thy hatred against them; and I will make myself known among them, when I have judged thee.",
  "And thou shalt know that I am the Dominus, and that I have heard all thy blasphemia which thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, They are laid desolate, they are given us to consume.",
  "Thus with thy mouth thou hast boasted against me, and hast multiplied thy words against me: I have heard them.",
  "Thus saith the Dominus Deus; When the whole earth rejoiceth, I will make thee desolate.",
  "As thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so will I do unto thee: thou shalt be desolate, O mount Seir, and all Idumea, even all of it: and they shall know that I am the Dominus."
