                    <p>And Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of Malchiah, heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken unto all the people, saying, Maledicam ego vos, dicit Iudae dominus, qui ponitis fiduciam in Aegypto, ut sit salus vestra, et eritis deleti, et desolabuntur omnes qui confidunt in Aegypto. (1)</p>
<p>Thus saith the LORD, He that remaineth in this city shall surely die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth forth to the Chaldeans shall live; and his life shall be unto him for a prey, et eripiet animam suam a morte, dicit dominus. (2)</p>
<p>For I will give the orders, dicit dominus, to the king of Babylon's army, to burn this city with fire, and to destroy it, and to make it desolate, without an inhabitant, propter malitiam domus Israel et domus Iuda, quae fecerunt malum coram me, provocantes me in cunctis diebus. (3)</p>
<p>Yet hear the word of the LORD, O ye kings of Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem, haec dicit dominus exercituum, Deus Israel, Ecee ego mittam, et assumam omnes gentes aquilonis, dicit dominus, et Nabuchodonosor regem Babylonis, servum meum, et adducam eos super terram hanc, et super habitatores eius, et super omnes gentes, quae sunt in circuitu eius, et conteram eos in comminutionem aeternam, et ponam eos in exemplum, et in stuporem, et in sempiternum desolationem, (4)</p>
<p>And I will take away from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the candle, et conteram omnem terram istam in desolationem, et in stuporem, dicit dominus. (5)</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the LORD had commanded him to speak unto all the people, that the priests and the prophets and all the people took him, saying, Thou shalt surely die, quia tu locutus es in nomine domini, haec dicit dominus, Erit pax, et prosperitas, et dixisti, Non erit pax, sed gladius et fames, et pestis, et tradidi te in manu inimicorum tuorum, qui quærunt animam tuam. (6)</p>
<p>Then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the people, saying, This man is worthy to die; for he hath prophesied against this city, as ye have heard with your ears, et dixit Ieremias ad omnes principes, et ad omnem populum, dicit dominus, Qui misit me, ut propheta in medio vestri, scitis. (7)</p>
<p>Behold, Hananiah the son of Azur the prophet, which was of Gibeon, spake unto me in the house of the LORD, before the priests and all the people, saying, sic dicit dominus exercituum, Deus Israel, Conteram iugum regis Babylonis, quod est super cervicem vestram, intra duos annos dies, et reducam ad locum istum vasa domus domini, quae tulit Nabuchodonosor rex Babylonis de loco isto, et transtulit ea in Babylonem, (8)</p>
<p>Then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of the LORD, dixitque Ieremias propheta, Amen, sic fiat, dicit dominus, concrepet dominus in verbo tuo, et reducat vasa domus domini, et omnes transmigrantes, et reddat te, et omnes Iudaeos, qui sunt in Babylone, in locum istum, (9)</p>
<p>But since thou hast spoken against the city of Jerusalem, I will send thee away from the presence of all thy friends, and from the presence of all the people of Judah, and thou shalt go to Babylon, and there thou shalt die, et in Babylone morieris, tu, et omnes qui te sequuntur, quia mentitus es in nomine domini. (10)</p>
<p>Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiah's neck, and brake it, et dixit in conspectu omnis populi, sic dicit dominus, Sic confringo iugum Nabuchodonosor regis Babylonis de cervicibus omnium gentium intra duos annos dies, et tulit Ieremias propheta iugum a collo suo. (11)</p>
<p>And the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the prophet, after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying, vade, et dices ad Hananiam, dicit dominus, Tu confrregisti lignum, sed ego creabo ferrum, (12)</p>
<p>For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him: and I have given him the beasts of the field also, et conteram te, et domum tuam, dicit dominus, quia mentitus es in nomine domini, ut traderem te in manu inimicorum tuorum, et in manu filiorum tuorum, qui quærunt animam tuam. (13)</p>
<p>Then Jeremiah the prophet said unto Hananiah the prophet, Hear now, Hananiah; The LORD hath not sent thee; but thou makest this people to trust in a lie, et conteram te, et domum tuam, dicit dominus, quia mentitus es in nomine domini, ut traderem te in manu inimicorum tuorum, et in manu filiorum tuorum, qui quærunt animam tuam. (14)</p>
<p>Yea, thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will cast thee from off the face of the earth: this year thou shalt die, because thou hast taught rebellion against the LORD, et dixit Ieremias ad Hananiam, Audi verbum domini, Hanania, mittit te dominus prophetare contra te, ut auferas animam tuam de terra hac. (15)</p>
<p>So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month, et dixit Ieremias, Tu es prophetatus contra te, ut aufferes animam tuam de terra hac, et mortuus est Anania in ipso anno, in mense septimo. (16)</p>
<p>Now it came to pass in the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that this word came from the LORD, saying, sic dicit dominus, Vade, et descende in domum regis Iudae, et loqueris ibi verbum hoc, (17)</p>
<p>Then I spake to the king also, saying, Ah king Joram, thus saith the LORD God of Israel, If thou wilt hearken unto me, I will give thee thy life, and the life of thy sons, and of thy daughters, and of thy wives, and of thy servants, and of the people of the city, and I will give thee into the hand of the king of Babylon, tu autem, et omnes, qui sunt tecum, et omnis terra tua, eritis servientes ei, et servietis ei, et omnibus gentibus, quas ego misi in te, et in omni terra, in qua ambulas, (18)</p>
<p>And now therefore thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the city, whereof ye sent unto me to inquire of the LORD; sic dicit dominus, Ecee ego mittam, et concrepet omnes Iudaeos, qui sunt in terra Aegypti, gladio, et fame, et peste, donec deleantur. (19)</p>
<p>And they shall know whose words shall stand, mine or theirs, et videbitis, inquit dominus, cuius verbum steterit, meum an vestrum. (20)</p>
<p>Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will give Pharaoh-hophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that seek his life, as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, inimicum suum, et quærens animam eius, et tradidi eum in manu inimicorum eius, et in manu quærentium animam eius. (21)</p>
<p>And Jeremiah said unto the king, Ah king Joram, thus saith the LORD God of Israel, If thou wilt hearken unto me, I will give thee thy life, and the life of thy sons, and of thy daughters, and of thy wives, and of thy servants, and of the people of the city, and I will give thee into the hand of the king of Babylon, tu autem, et omnes, qui sunt tecum, et omnis terra tua, eritis servientes ei, et servietis ei, et omnibus gentibus, quas ego misi in te, et in omni terra, in qua ambulas, (22)</p>
<p>Then Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Precamur te, ut oremus pro nobis dominum Deum nostrum, quia multitudo magna est, quae remansit ex Iudaea, et nos remansimus pauci de multis, sicut videmus oculis nostris, (23)</p>
<p>Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands, wherewith ye fight against the king of Babylon, and against the Chaldeans, which besiege you without the walls, and I will assemble them into the midst of this city, et congregabo eos in medio civitatis huius, (24)</p>
<p>And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, even in anger, and in fury, and in great wrath, et pugnabo contra vos in brachio extento, et in ira, et in furore, et in indignatione magna. (25)</p>
<p>And I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast: they shall die of a great pestilence, et percutiam habitatores civitatis huius, homines et bestias, et morientur in peste magna. (26)</p>
<p>And afterward, saith the LORD, I will deliver Zedekiah king of Judah, and his servants, and the people, and such as are left in this city from the pestilence, and from the sword, and from the famine, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those that seek their life: and he shall smite them with the edge of the sword; he shall not spare them, neither have pity, nor have mercy, et tradam Sedeciam regem Iudae, et servos eius, et populum, et eos, qui remanserunt in civitate hac a peste, et a gladio, et a fame, in manu Nabuchodonosor regis Babylonis, et in manu inimicorum suorum, et in manu quærentium animam suam, et percutiet eos in ore gladii, non parcet eis, et non miserebitur, et non cruetur. (27)</p>
<p>And unto this people thou shalt say, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I set before you the way of life, and the way of death, ecce pono coram vobis, inquit dominus, viam vitae, et viam mortis. (28)</p>
<p>He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth out, and falleth to the Chaldeans that besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be unto him for a prey, et eripiet animam suam a morte, dicit dominus. (29)</p>
<p>For I have set my face against this city for evil, and not for good, saith the LORD: it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire, et dabo civitatem hanc in manu regis Babylonis, et exuret eam igni. (30)</p>
<p>And touching the house of the king of Judah, say, Hear ye the word of the LORD; O house of David, thus saith the LORD; Execute judgment in the morning, and deliver him that is spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor, lest my fury go out like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings, et dixit dominus, Domus regis Iudae, audite verbum domini, (31)</p>
<p>Behold, I will punish him, and his seed, and his servants for the wickedness of his doing, et visitabo super eum, et super semen eius, et super servos eius, propter malitiam operum suorum. (32)</p>
<p>Thus saith the LORD, Write ye this man childless, a man that shall not prosper in his days: for no man of his seed shall prosper, sitting upon the throne of David, and ruling any more in Judah, sic dicit dominus, Scribite virum hunc absque liberis, virum, qui non prosperabitur in diebus suis, quia non erit de semine eius vir, qui sedit super thronum David, et non regnet ultra in Iudaea. (33)</p>
<p>Woe be unto thee, O Jerusalem: for the LORD hath rejected thee, vae tibi, Ierusalem, quia dominus repulit te, (34)</p>
<p>Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it, et dabo civitatem hanc in manu regis Babylonis, et capiet eam. (35)</p>
<p>And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that this word came from the LORD, saying, sic dicit dominus, (36)</p>
<p>Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands, wherewith ye fight against the king of Babylon, and against the Chaldeans, which besiege you without the walls, et congregabo eos in medio civitatis huius, (37)</p>
<p>And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, even in anger, and in fury, and in great wrath, et pugnabo contra vos in brachio extento, et in ira, et in furore, et in indignatione magna. (38)</p>
