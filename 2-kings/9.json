  "And Elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophetae, and said unto him, Gird up thy loins, and take this flask of oleum in thine hand, and go to Ramoth in Gilead.",
  "And when thou comest thither, look out there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise up from among his fratres, and bring him to an secretus locus.",
  "Then take the flask of oleum, and pour it on his caput, and say, Thus saith Dominus, I have anointed thee rex over Israel. Then open the ostium, and flee, and tarry not.",
  "So the young man, even the servus of the prophetae, went to Ramoth in Gilead.",
  "And when he came, behold, the capitanei of the exercitus were sitting; and he said, I have an errand to thee, O capitaneus. And Jehu said, Unto which of all us? And he said, To thee, O capitaneus.",
  "And he arose, and went into the domus; and the prophetae poured the oleum on his caput, and said unto him, Thus saith Dominus Deus of Israel, I have anointed thee rex over the people of Dominus, even over Israel.",
  "And thou shalt smite the domus of Ahab thy dominus, that I may avenge the sanguinem of my servos the prophetae, and the sanguinem of all the servos of Dominus, at the hand of Izebel.",
  "And I will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the parietem, and him that is shut up and left in Israel:",
  "And I will make the domus of Ahab like the domus of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the domus of Baasha the son of Ahijah:",
  "And the canes shall eat Izebel in the ager of Jezreel, and there shall be none to sepelire her. And he opened the ostium, and fled.",
  "Then Jehu came forth to the servos of his dominus: and one said unto him, Is all well? wherefore came this insanis to thee? And he said unto them, Ye know the homo and his locutio.",
  "And they said, It is falsus; tell us now. And he said, Thus and thus spake he to me, saying, Thus saith Dominus, I have anointed thee rex over Israel.",
  "Then they hasted, and took every man his pallium, and put it under him on the top of the scala, and blew with cornua, saying, Jehu is rex.",
  "So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram had kept Ramoth in Gilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael rex of Syria:",
  "But rex Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael rex of Syria.) And Jehu said, If it be your voluntas, let not a fugitivus escape out of the civitas, to go to tell it in Jezreel.",
  "So Jehu rode in a currus, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there. And Ahaziah rex of Judah was come down to see Joram.",
  "And there stood a speculator on the turre of Jezreel, and he spied the multitude of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a multitude. And Joram said, Take an equum, and send to meet them, and let him say, Is it pacem?",
  "So there went one on equo to meet him, and said, Thus saith the rex, Is it pacem? And Jehu said, What hast thou to do with pacem? turn thee behind me. And the speculator told, saying, The messenger came to them, but he came not again.",
  "Then he sent out a secundus on equo, which came to them, and said, Thus saith the rex, Is it pacem? And Jehu answered, What hast thou to do with pacem? turn thee behind me.",
  "And the speculator told, saying, He came even unto them, and came not again: and the vehementia of his currus is like the vehementia of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he driveth furiosus.",
  "And Joram said, Make ready. And his currus was made ready. And Joram rex of Israel and Ahaziah rex of Judah went out, each in his currus, and they went out against Jehu, and met him in the ager of Naboth the Jezreelite.",
  "And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it pacem, Jehu? And he answered, What pacem, so long as the fornication of thy mater Izebel and her veneficia are so many?",
  "And Joram turned his manus, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, There is dolus, O Ahaziah.",
  "And Jehu drew a arcus with his plena manus, and smote Joram between the scapulae, and the sagitta went out at his cor; and he sunk down in his currus.",
  "Then said Jehu to Bidkar his dux, Take up, and cast him in the ager of Naboth the Jezreelite: for remember how that, when I and thou rode together after Ahab his pater, Dominus laid this onus upon him;",
  "Surely I have seen yesterday the sanguinem of Naboth, and the sanguinem of his filii, saith Dominus; and I will render it unto thee in this ager, saith Dominus. Now therefore, take and cast him into the ager, according to the verbum of Dominus.",
  "But when Ahaziah rex of Judah saw this, he fled by the via of the hortus domus. And Jehu followed after him, and said, Smite him also in the currus. And they did so at the ascendens of Gur, which is by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo, and died there.",
  "And his servos carried him in a currus to Jerusalem, and buried him in his sepulchrum with his patres in civitate David.",
  "And in the undecimo anno of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah to reign over Judah.",
  "And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Izebel heard of it; and she painted her oculi, and tired her caput, and looked out at a fenestra.",
  "And as Jehu entered in at the porta, she said, Had Zimri pacem, who slew his dominus?",
  "And he lifted up his facies to the fenestra, and said, Who is on my side? who? And there looked out to him two or three eunuchi.",
  "And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down: and some of her sanguinem was sprinkled on the parietem, and on the equi: and he trod her under foot.",
  "And when he was come in, he did eat and drink, and said, Go, see now this maledicta, and bury her: for she is a filia regis.",
  "And they went to bury her: but they found no more of her than the cranium, and the pedes, and the palmae of her manus.",
  "Wherefore they came again, and told him. And he said, This is the verbum of Dominus, which he spake by his servus Elijah the Tishbite, saying, In the ager of Jezreel shall canes eat the carnes of Izebel:",
  "And the carnes of Izebel shall be as dung upon the facies of the ager; that they shall not say, This is Izebel."
