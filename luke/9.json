  "Then he called his twelve discipuli together, and gave them potestas and autoritas over all daemones, and to cure diseases.",
  "And he sent them to praedicare the kingdom of Deus, and to heal the infirmi.",
  "And he said unto them, Take nothing for your journey, neither virga, nor scrip, neither panem, nor pecunia; neither have two tunicae.",
  "And whatsoever domus ye enter into, there abide, and thence depart.",
  "And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that civitas, shake off the pulvis from your pedes for a testimonium against them.",
  "And they departed, and went through the villas, praedicating the evangelium, and healing every where.",
  "Now Herodes the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and he was perplexed, because that it was said of some, that Ioannes was risen from the mortui;",
  "And of some, that Elias had appeared; and of others, that one of the veteres prophetas was risen again.",
  "And Herodes said, Ioannes have I beheaded: but who is this, of whom I hear such things? And he desired to see him.",
  "And the apostoli, when they were returned, told him all that they had done. And he took them, and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the civitas called Bethsaida.",
  "And the multitudes, when they knew it, followed him: and he received them, and spake unto them of the kingdom of Deus, and healed them that had need of curatio.",
  "And when the day began to decline, then came the duodecim, and said unto him, Send the multitudinem away, that they may go into the villas and the agri round about, and lodge, and find victus: for we are here in a desert place.",
  "But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have no more but five panes, and two pisces; except we should go and buy victus for all this populus.",
  "For they were about five thousand homines. And he said to his discipuli, Make them sit down by fifties in a company.",
  "And they did so, and made them all sit down.",
  "Then he took the five panes, and the two pisces, and looking up to caelum, he blessed them, and brake, and gave to the discipuli to set before the multitudinem.",
  "And they did eat, and were all filled: and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets.",
  "And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his discipuli were with him: and he asked them, saying, Whom say the multitudinem that I am?",
  "They answering said, Ioannes the Baptist; but some say, Elias; and others say, that one of the veteres prophetas is risen again.",
  "He said unto them, But whom say ye that I am? Petrus answering said, The Christ of Deus.",
  "And he straitly charged them, and commanded them to tell no man that thing;",
  "Saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the seniores, and of the principes of the sacerdotes, and be slain, and be raised the third day.",
  "And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his crucem daily, and follow me.",
  "For whosoever will save his vita, shall lose it: but whosoever will lose his vita for my sake, the same shall save it.",
  "For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole mundus, and lose himself, or be cast away?",
  "For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my verba, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own gloria, and in his Father's, and of the holy angels.",
  "But I tell you of a veritas, there be some standing here, which shall not taste mortem, till they see the kingdom of Deus.",
  "And it came to pass about an octo dies after these sayings, he took Petrus and Ioannes and Iacobus, and went up into a montem to pray.",
  "And as he prayed, the aspectus of his facies was altered, and his vestimenta were white and resplendent.",
  "And, behold, there talked with him two viri, which were Moyses and Elias:",
  "Who appeared in gloria, and spake of his exitus, which he should accomplish at Hierosolyma.",
  "But Petrus and they that were with him were heavy with somnus: and when they were awake, they saw his gloria, and the two viri that stood with him.",
  "And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Petrus said unto Iesum, Rabbi, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacula; one for thee, and one for Moyses, and one for Elias: not knowing what he said.",
  "While he thus spake, there came a nubes, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the nubes.",
  "And there came a vox out of the nubes, saying, This is my dilectus Son: hear him.",
  "And when the vox was past, Iesus was found alone. And they kept it close, and told no man in those dies any of those things which they had seen.",
  "And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they came down from the montem, much populus met him.",
  "And, behold, a viri of the multitudinem cried out, saying, Rabbi, I beseech thee, look upon my filius: for he is mine unicus.",
  "And, lo, a spiritus taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth again, and bruising him hardly departeth from him.",
  "And I asked thy discipuli to cast him out; and they could not.",
  "And Iesus answering said, O generatio incredula and perverse, how long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring thy filius hither.",
  "And as he was yet a coming, the daemonium rent him and tare him. And Iesus rebuked the unclean spiritus, and healed the puer, and delivered him again to his pater.",
  "And they were all amazed at the magnificentia of Deus. But while they wondered every one at all things which Iesus did, he said unto his discipuli,"
