                    <p>Then came certain of the elders of Israel unto me, and sat before me. And the word of the Dominus came unto me, saying,</p>
<p>Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their heart, and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face: should I be inquired of at all by them?</p>
<p>Therefore speak unto them, and say unto them, Thus saith the Dominus Deus; Every man of the house of Israel that setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh unto the prophet; I the Dominus will answer him that cometh according to the multitude of his idols;</p>
<p>That I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because they are all estranged from me through their idols.</p>
<p>Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Dominus Deus; Repent, and turn yourselves from your idols; and turn away your faces from all your abominations.</p>
<p>For every one of the house of Israel, or of the stranger that sojourneth in Israel, which separateth himself from me, and setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh unto a prophet to inquire of him concerning me; I the Dominus will answer him by myself:</p>
<p>And I will set my face against that man, and will make him a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the midst of my people; and ye shall know that I am the Dominus.</p>
<p>And if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing, I the Dominus have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand upon him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.</p>
<p>And they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity: the punishment of the prophet shall be even as the punishment of him that seeketh unto him;</p>
<p>That the house of Israel may go no more astray from me, neither be polluted any more with all their transgressions; but that they may be my people, and I may be their Deus, saith the Dominus Deus.</p>
<p>The word of the Dominus came again unto me, saying,</p>
<p>Also, thou son of man, thus saith the Dominus Deus unto the land of Israel; An end, the end is come upon the four corners of the land.</p>
<p>Now is the end come upon thee, and I will send mine anger upon thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense upon thee all thine abominations.</p>
<p>And none of thee shall escape nor deliver himself, but he that is slain with the sword, and he that dieth of the famine, and he that is slain with the pestilence, he shall be delivered; but the rest of you I will scatter into all the winds.</p>
<p>Thus shall mine anger be accomplished, and I will cause my fury to rest upon them, and I will be comforted: and they shall know that I the Dominus have spoken it in my zeal, when I have accomplished my fury in them.</p>
<p>Moreover the word of the Dominus came unto me, saying,</p>
<p>Also, thou son of man, thus saith the Dominus Deus; The sword, the sword is drawn: for the slaughter it is furbished, that it may glitter, that it may be furbished for the slaughter.</p>
<p>Thou hast appointed it for judgment, and to the sword it is given, that it may glitter, that it may be furbished for the slaughter, to the extent that it may slay, and that it may glitter, and that the heart may melt, and that the ruins may be multiplied: Ah, it is made for slaughter.</p>
<p>Gather thee together, that I may slay thee with the slaughter, and that I may destroy thee, and that I may make thee to be no more; and thou shalt know that I am the Dominus.</p>
<p>Appoint it for judgment, and prepare it for the slaughter, that it may glitter, that it may be furbished for the slaughter, to the extent that it may slay, and that it may glitter, and that the heart may melt, and that the ruins may be multiplied.</p>
<p>I have set the point of the sword before them, that they may go into the darkness, and that they may stumble and fall, and that they may be destroyed: Ah, it is made for slaughter.</p>
<p>And it shall be, when they see thee, they shall see thee, thou shalt be in their eyes as a sword.</p>
<p>Thus saith the Dominus Deus; The sword, the sword is drawn: for the slaughter it is furbished, that it may glitter, that it may be furbished for the slaughter.</p>
<p>Cry and howl, son of man: for it shall be upon my people, it shall be upon all the princes of Israel: terrors by reason of the sword shall be upon my people, and upon all the princes of Israel: Ah, it is made for slaughter.</p>
<p>Appoint it for judgment, and prepare it for the slaughter, that it may glitter, that it may be furbished for the slaughter, to the extent that it may slay, and that it may glitter, and that the heart may melt, and that the ruins may be multiplied.</p>
<p>Set thee the way, appoint the knife for slaughter, that it may glitter, that it may be furbished for the slaughter, to the extent that it may slay, and that it may glitter, and that the heart may melt, and that the ruins may be multiplied.</p>
<p>Thou hast appointed it for judgment, and to the sword it is given, that it may glitter, that it may be furbished for the slaughter, to the extent that it may slay, and that it may glitter, and that the heart may melt, and that the ruins may be multiplied: Ah, it is made for slaughter.</p>
<p>And it shall be, when they see thee, they shall see thee, thou shalt be in their eyes as a sword.</p>
<p>Thus saith the Dominus Deus; The sword, the sword is drawn: for the slaughter it is furbished, that it may glitter, that it may be furbished for the slaughter.</p>
