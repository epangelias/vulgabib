  "Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, caro, that we, no longer slaves to sin, might live the rest of our time in the flesh, caro, to the will of Deus.",
  "Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evil doers, they may by your good works, opera, which they shall behold, glorify Deus in the day of visitation.",
  "For it is better, if the will of Deus be so, that ye suffer for well doing, than for evil doing.",
  "Seeing then that Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, caro, arm yourselves likewise with the same mindset: for he that hath suffered in the flesh, caro, hath ceased from sin;",
  "That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh, caro, to the lusts of men, but to the will of Deus.",
  "For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lascivia, lusts, excess of wine, excess of tables, abominable idolatriae, and hatred;",
  "But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malitia, blasphemia, filthy communication out of your mouth.",
  "Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old homo, with his deeds;",
  "And have put on the new, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:",
  "Where there is neither Graecus nor Iudaeus, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all.",
  "Put on therefore, as the elect of Deus, holy and beloved, bowels of misericordiae, kindness, humilitas, meekness, longsuffering;",
  "Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye.",
  "And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness.",
  "And let the pax of Deus rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful.",
  "Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.",
  "And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Iesus, giving thanks to Deus and the Pater by him.",
  "Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.",
  "For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward Deus endure grief, suffering wrongfully.",
  "For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with Deus.",
  "For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his footsteps:",
  "Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:",
  "Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously:",
  "Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripe ye were healed.",
  "For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls."
