                    <p>1 Thus saith the Dominus, Descendo from thine house, O king of Judah, thou, and thy servus, and thy populus, that are entering into this domus.</p>
<p>2 Thus saith the Dominus, Do justitiam and judgment, and deliver the spoliatum out of the manus of the oppressor, and do no wrong, do no violentia to the peregrinus, to the orphanus, and to the widow, neither shed innocentem sanguinem in this loco.</p>
<p>3 For if ye do this thing indeed, then shall there enter in at the portae of this domus, kings sitting upon the thronus of Davidus, riding in currus and on equus, he and his servus, and his populus.</p>
<p>4 But if ye will not hear these verba, I spondeo by myself, saith the Dominus, that this domus shall become a desolatio.</p>
<p>5 For thus saith the Dominus of the exercitus, the God of Israel; Ye shall not be destroyed, ye shall not be dissipati, if ye can do justitiam and judgment every homo with his proximus.</p>
<p>6 Ye have done violence to the alienigena, to the orphanus and to the widow, and the innocentem sanguinem have ye shed in this loco, and are risen up early and have walked every homo after the imagination of his malus heart.</p>
<p>7 Therefore thus saith the Dominus of the exercitus, the God of Israel; Behold, I bring a malum upon this loco, which whosoever heareth, his aures shall tingle.</p>
<p>8 And many gentes shall pass by this civitas, and they shall say every homo to his proximus, Wherefore hath the Dominus done thus unto this great civitas?</p>
<p>9 Then they shall say, Because they have forsaken the foedus of the Dominus their Deus, and worshipped other dii, and served them.</p>
<p>10 Weep ye not for the mortuus, neither bemoan him, but weep sore for him that goeth away, for he shall return no more, neither shall he see the terra where he was natus.</p>
<p>11 For thus saith the Dominus touching Shallum the filius of Josiah king of Judah, which reigned instead of Josiah his pater, which went forth out of this loco; He shall not return thither any more:</p>
<p>12 But he shall die in the terra whither they have led him captive, and shall see this terra no more.</p>
<p>13 Woe unto him that buildeth his domus by injustitia, and his cenacula by calumnia, that useth his proximus servum without merces, and giveth him not for his opus:</p>
<p>14 That saith, I will build me a domus of cenacula, and largi porticus, that I may open largi fenestrae, and ceiled with cedrus, and painted with vermiculus.</p>
<p>15 Shalt thou reign, because thou closest thyself in cedrus? did not thy pater eat and drink, and do justitiam and judgment, and then it was bene with him?</p>
<p>16 He judged the causam of the pauper and the egenus, then it was bene with him, was not this to know me? saith the Dominus.</p>
<p>17 But thine oculus and thine cor are not but for thy covetousness, and for to shed innocentem sanguinem, and for oppression, and for calumnia to do it.</p>
<p>18 Therefore thus saith the Dominus touching Jehoiakim the filius of Josiah king of Judah; They shall not lament for him, saying, Ah my frater! or, Ah sister! they shall not lament for him, saying, Ah domine! or, Ah his gloria!</p>
<p>19 He shall be buried with the burial of an asinus, drawn and cast forth beyond the portae of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>20 Go up to Lebanon, and cry; and lift up thy vox in Bashan, and cry from the littus, for all thy amici are destroyed.</p>
<p>21 I spake unto thee in thy prosperitas; but thou saidest, I will not hear. This hath been thy via from thy iuventus, that thou obeyedst not my vox.</p>
<p>22 The ventus shall eat up all thy pastores, and thy amici shall go into captivity, surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for all thy malum.</p>
<p>23 O inhabitatrix of Lebanon, that makest thy nest in the cedars, how gracious shalt thou be when puerperas, how dost thou now lament when pangs come upon thee, the dolor as of a parturientia.</p>
<p>24 As I live, saith the Dominus, though Coniah the filius of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet upon my dexteram manus, yet I would pluck thee thence;</p>
<p>25 And I will give thee into the manus of them that seek thy anima, and into the manus of them whom thou fearest, even into the manus of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the manus of the Chaldei.</p>
<p>26 And I will cast thee out, and thy mater that bare thee, into another terra, where ye were not born; and there shall ye die.</p>
<p>27 But to the terra, whither they desire to return, thither shall they not return.</p>
<p>28 Is this homo Coniah a despised, broken idolum? is he a vas wherein is no pleasure? wherefore are they cast out, he and his semen, and cast into a terra which they know not?</p>
<p>29 O terra, terra, terra, hear the verba of the Dominus.</p>
<p>30 Thus saith the Dominus, Write ye this homo childless, a homo that shall not prosper in his dies, for no homo of his semen shall prosper, sitting upon the thronus of Davidus, and ruling any more in Judah.</p>
