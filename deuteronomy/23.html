                    <p>1 He that is wounded in the stones, or hath his membrum virile cut off, shall not enter into the congregation of the Domini.</p>
<p>2 A mamzer shall not enter into the congregation of the Domini; even to his tenth generation shall he not enter into the congregation of the Domini.</p>
<p>3 An Ammonites or Moabites shall not enter into the congregation of the Domini; even to their tenth generation shall they not enter into the congregation of the Domini for ever:</p>
<p>4 Because they met you not with panis and aqua in the via, when ye came out of Aegyptus; and because they hired against thee Balaam filius Beor of Mesopotamia, of the flumen, to curse thee:</p>
<p>5 Nevertheless the Domini thy Deus would not hearken unto Balaam; but the Domini thy Deus turned the maledictio into benedictio unto thee, because the Domini thy Deus loved thee.</p>
<p>6 Thou shalt not seek their pacem nor their bonum all thy days for ever.</p>
<p>7 Thou shalt not abhor an Edomites; for he is thy frater: thou shalt not abhor an Aegyptius; because thou wast a peregrinus in his terra.</p>
<p>8 The filius of the third generation that is born of them shall enter into the congregation of the Domini.</p>
<p>9 When the exercitus goeth out against thy inimicos, then keep thee from omne malum.</p>
<p>10 If there be among you any homo, that is not mundus by nocturna pollutio, then shall he go abroad out of the castra, he shall not come within the castra:</p>
<p>11 But it shall be, when evening cometh on, he shall lavare himselfe with aqua: and when the sol is down, he shall come into the castra again.</p>
<p>12 Thou shalt have a locus also without the castra, whither thou shalt go forth abroad:</p>
<p>13 And thou shalt have a paxillum upon thy instrumentum: and it shall be, when thou sittest down without, thou shalt dig therewith, and shalt turn back and cover that which cometh from thee:</p>
<p>14 For the Domini thy Deus walketh in the midst of thy castra, to deliver thee, and to give thy inimicos before thee; therefore shall thy castra be sanctus: that he see no turpitudo in thee, and turn away from thee.</p>
<p>15 Thou shalt not deliver unto his dominus the servus, which is escaped from his dominus unto thee:</p>
<p>16 He shall dwell with thee, even among you, in the locus which he shall choose in one of thy portae, where it liketh him best: thou shalt not oppress him.</p>
<p>17 There shall be no meretrix of the filiae of Israel, nor shall there be a scortator of the filii of Israel.</p>
<p>18 Thou shalt not bring the hire of a scortator, or the pretium of a canis, into the domus of the Domini thy Deus for any votum: for even both these are abomination unto the Domini thy Deus.</p>
<p>19 Thou shalt not lend upon usura to thy frater; usura of pecunia, usura of cibus, usura of any thing that is lent upon usura:</p>
<p>20 Unto a peregrinus thou mayest lend upon usura; but unto thy frater thou shalt not lend upon usura: that the Domini thy Deus may bless thee in all that thou settest thine hand to in the terra whither thou goest to possess it.</p>
<p>21 When thou shalt vow a votum unto the Domini thy Deus, thou shalt not slack to pay it: for the Domini thy Deus will surely require it of thee; and it would be peccatum in thee.</p>
<p>22 But if thou shalt forbear to vow, it shall be no peccatum in thee.</p>
<p>23 That which is gone out of thy lips thou shalt keep and perform; even a spontaneum offering, according as thou hast vowed unto the Domini thy Deus, which thou hast promised with thy mouth.</p>
<p>24 When thou comest into the vineyard of thy proximus, thou mayest eat grapes at thy own will; but thou shalt not put any in thy vasculum.</p>
<p>25 When thou comest into the segetes of thy proximus, thou mayest pluck the spicas with thine hand; but thou shalt not move a falx unto the segetes of thy proximus.</p>
