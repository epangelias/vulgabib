                    <p>And I saw in the dexteram of Him that sat on the throne a libellus, written within and on the backside, sealed with septem seals.</p>
<p>And I saw a strong Angel proclaiming with a loud vox, Who is worthy to open the libellus, and to loose the septem seals thereof?</p>
<p>And no man in caelum, nor in terra, neither under the terra, was able to open the libellus, neither to look thereon.</p>
<p>And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the libellum, neither to look thereon.</p>
<p>And one of the seniores saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Leo of the tribe of Iuda, the radix David, hath prevailed to open the libellus, and to loose the septem seals thereof.</p>
<p>And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the quatuor beasts, and in the midst of the seniores, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having septem cornua and septem oculi, which are the septem Spiritus of God sent forth into all the terra.</p>
<p>And He came and took the libellus out of the dexteram of Him that sat upon the throne.</p>
<p>And when He had taken the libellus, the quatuor beasts and the twenty-four seniores fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harpae and golden vasa full of odorem.</p>
<p>And they sung a novum canticum, saying, Thou art worthy to take the libellum, and to open the septem seals thereof: for Thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy sanguinem out of every tribus, and lingua, and populus, and natio;</p>
<p>And hast made us unto our Deus reges and sacerdotes: and we shall reign on the terra.</p>
