  "1 They that trust in the Dominus shall be as mount Zion, which cannot be removed, but abideth for ever.",
  "2 As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the Dominus is round about his people from henceforth even for ever.",
  "3 For the sceptre of wickedness shall not rest upon the lot of the just, lest the just put forth their manus to iniquity.",
  "4 Do good, O Dominus, unto those that be boni, and to them that be recti in their cor.",
  "5 But those that declinaverunt unto their via pravam, the Dominus shall lead them forth with the operarii of iniquity: pax super Israel."
