  "Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the lex, how that the lex hath dominion over a homo, as long as he liveth?",
  "For the mulier which hath a vir, is bound by the lex to that vir so long as he liveth; but if the vir be dead, she is freed from the lex of that vir.",
  "So then if, while her vir liveth, she be married to another vir, she shall be called an adultera: but if her vir be dead, she is free from that lex; so that she is no adultera, though she be married to another vir.",
  "Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become mortui to the lex by the corpus of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the mortui, that we should bring forth fructus unto Deus.",
  "For when we were in the carne, the passiones of peccata, which were by the lex, did work in our membra to bring forth fructus unto mors.",
  "But now we are delivered from the lex, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in novusness of spirit, and not in the vetusness of the littera.",
  "What shall we say then? Is the lex peccatum? Deus forbid. Nay, I had not known peccatum, but by the lex: for I had not known concupiscentia, except the lex had said, Thou shalt not concupiscere.",
  "But peccatum, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all kinds of concupiscentia. For without the lex peccatum was mortuum.",
  "For I was alive without the lex once: but when the commandment came, peccatum revived, and I mortuus.",
  "And the commandment, which was ordained to vita, I found to be unto mors.",
  "For peccatum, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.",
  "Wherefore the lex is sanctus, and the commandment sanctus, and justus, and bonus.",
  "Was then that which is bonus made mors unto me? Deus forbid. But peccatum, that it might appear peccatum, working mors in me by that which is bonus; that peccatum by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.",
  "For we know that the lex is spiritus: but I am carnis, sold under peccatum.",
  "For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.",
  "If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the lex that it is bonus.",
  "Now then it is no more I that do it, but peccatum that dwelleth in me.",
  "For I know that in me (that is, in my carne,) dwelleth no bonus thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is bonus I find not.",
  "For the bonus that I would I do not: but the malus which I would not, that I do.",
  "Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but peccatum that dwelleth in me.",
  "I find then a lex, that, when I would do bonus, peccatum is present with me.",
  "For I delight in the lex of Deus after the inward homo:",
  "But I see another lex in my membra, warring against the lex of my mens, and bringing me into captivitatem to the lex of peccati which is in my membra.",
  "O wretched homo that I am! who shall deliver me from the corpus of this mors?",
  "I thank Deus through Iesus Christus our Dominus. So then with the mens I myself serve the lex of Deus; but with the carne the lex of peccati."
