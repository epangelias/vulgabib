  "Woe to them that go down to Aegyptum for help; and stay on horses, and trust in chariots, because they are many; and in horsemen, because they are very strong; but they look not unto the Sanctus of Israel, neither seek the Dominus.",
  "Yet he also is wise, and will bring malum upon them, and will not call back his verbum, but will arise against the domus of the malignant, and against the auxilium of those that do wickedly.",
  "The Aegyptii are men, and not Deus; and their horses flesh, and not spiritus: when the Dominus shall stretch out his manum, both he that helpeth shall fall, and he that is holpen shall fall down, and they all shall perish together.",
  "For thus hath the Dominus spoken unto me, Like as the leo shall roar, and the catulus of the leones over his prey, whom none shall deliver; so shall the Dominus exercituum descend to fight for mount Sion, and for the collis thereof.",
  "Like as the avis flyeth about her pullos, so shall the Dominus exercituum defend Jerusalem, defending he shall also deliver it; and passing over he shall preserve it.",
  "Turn ye unto him from whom the children of Israel have deeply revolted.",
  "For in that day every man shall cast away his idols of argentum, and his idols of aurum, which your own manus have made unto you for a peccatum.",
  "Then shall the Assyrius fall with gladius, not of a vir, and a gladius, not of a homo, shall devour him: and he shall flee from the gladius, and his iuvenes shall be tributarii.",
  "He shall pass over unto his fortitudo because of the terror of the Dominus shall he make his officium, and the rex of Assyria shall be his tributarius.",
  "Behold, the Domina of the hostis shall come with flamma, and his currus like a tempest, to render his indignation with furor, and his rebuke with flamma of ignis.",
  "For the Dominus shall ascend upon them like a flamma of ignis, and like a tempest shall consume them in his ira, and trouble and anguish shall be upon every facies.",
  "Thus shall they be unto him, and to his populus in that day, that the forest of the silva shall be, and the arbustum of the forest, which shall be left of them: and it shall be so, that a puer may write them.",
  "And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of Israel, and such as are escaped of the domus of Jacob, shall no more again stay upon him that smote them; but shall stay upon the Dominus, the Sanctus of Israel, in veritate.",
  "The remnant shall be converted, the remnant of Jacob, unto the Deus fortes.",
  "For though thy populus Israel be as the arena of the mari, yet a reliquum of them shall be converted unto the Deus fortes.",
  "For consumption is determined, rising up in iustitia hath he consumed them, and he shall destroy them in iustitia.",
  "And it shall be as a flagellum of the flumen, a flagellum overflowing the pedes: for he shall cast down with the manu the rest of the silva.",
  "And the firmanentum of the silva shall be shaken with the ventus, and the petra shall be thrown down to the terra.",
  "And the turris of the fortitudinis shall be destroyed by the ventus, and the munitiones shall be consumed with ignis: and all that bear the gladius shall be destroyed.",
  "Every locutio of the lingua shall speak of the timor of the Dominus, and shall do according to his voluntas, with one shoulder, and with one mentum, shall they speak.",
  "To whom he said, This is rest; give rest to the fatigatus; and this is refrigerium: give refrigerium to the lassus; and this is the via, walk ye in it; and ye shall not err, though the impudicus shall impudice agere.",
  "And the people shall be oppressed, every man by his proximus, and every man by his amicus: the iuvenes shall rise up against the senes, and the ignobiles against the nobiles.",
  "When a man shall take hold of his fratrem of the domus of his pater, saying, Thou hast vestes, be our prince, and let this ruina be under thy manus:",
  "He shall swear, saying, I will not be the medicus of thy vulnera; for in my domus is neither panis nor vestis: make me not a prince of the populus.",
  "For Jerusalem is ruined, and Iudaea is fallen: because their lingua and their opera were against the Dominus, to provoke the oculos of his maiestas.",
  "The shew of their countenance doth witness against them; and they declare their peccata as Sodoma, they hide it not. Woe unto their animus, for they have devised malum against themselves, saying, Let us bind the iustus, for he is not habilis for us.",
  "Woe unto the wicked, it shall be ill with him: for the merces of his manus shall be given him.",
  "As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, they which lead thee cause thee to err, and destroy the via of thy pedes.",
  "The Dominus standeth up to plead, and standeth to iudicare the populos.",
  "The Dominus shall enter into iudicium with the senes of his populus, and the principes thereof: for ye have eaten up the vineyard; the spolium of the pauper is in your domus.",
  "What mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the facies of the pauper? saith the Dominus Deus exercituum.",
  "Because the filiae of Sion are haughty, and walk with necks stretched out and winking with their oculis, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their pedes:",
  "Therefore the Domina shall smite with scabie the caput of the filiabus of Sion, and the Dominus shall discover their pudenda.",
  "In that day the Domina shall take away the ornamenta of the calciamenta, and the little crowns, and the crescents;",
  "The chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers, The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legibus, and the headbands, and the tablets, and the earrings,",
  "The rings, and nose jewels, The festal apparel, and the mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping pins,",
  "The glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the vails.",
  "And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet odorem there shall be stench; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well set capillo, baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth; and burning instead of beautia.",
  "Thy men shall fall by the gladius, and thy fortes in the war.",
  "And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she being desolate shall sit upon the terra."
