                    <p>1 When thou goest out to battalia contra hostem tuum, thou shalt not be afraid of them: for the Lord thy Deus is with thee, which brought thee up out of the terra of Egypt.</p>
<p>2 And it shall be, when thou comest nigh unto the proelium, that the sacerdos shall approach and speak unto the populus,</p>
<p>3 And shall say unto them, Hear, O Israel, ye approach this die to battalia contra inimicos vestros: let not your corda faint, fear not, and do not tremble, neither be ye terrified because of them;</p>
<p>4 For the Lord your Deus is he that goeth with you, to fight pro vobis contra inimicos vestros, to save you.</p>
<p>5 And the officers shall speak unto the populus, saying, What homo is there that hath built a nova domus, and hath not dedicated it? let him go and return to his domus, lest he die in proelium, and another homo dedicate it.</p>
<p>6 And what homo is he that hath plantatum vineam, and hath not yet made it benedictam? let him also go and return unto his domus, lest he die in proelium, and another homo make it benedictam.</p>
<p>7 And what homo is there that hath espoused a mulier, and hath not taken her? let him go and return unto his domus, lest he die in proelium, and another homo take her.</p>
<p>8 And the officers shall speak further unto the populus, and they shall say, What homo is there that is timidus, and faint of corde? let him go and return unto his domus, lest his fratres faint of corde as well as he.</p>
<p>9 And it shall be, when the officers have made an end of speaking unto the populus, that they shall make captains of the exercitus to lead the populus.</p>
<p>10 When thou comest nigh unto a civitas to fight contra it, then proclaim pax unto it.</p>
<p>11 And it shall be, if it make thee a responsio of pax, and open unto thee, then it shall be, that all the populus that is found therein shall be tributarii unto thee, and they shall serve thee.</p>
<p>12 And if it will make no pax with thee, but will make proelium contra thee, then thou shalt obside it:</p>
<p>13 And when the Lord thy Deus hath delivered it into thy manus, thou shalt strike every masculus thereof with the edge of the gladius:</p>
<p>14 But the mulieres, and the parvuli, and the jumenta, and all that is in the civitas, even all the spolia thereof, thou shalt take unto thyself; and thou shalt eat the spolia of thine inimicos, which the Lord thy Deus hath given thee.</p>
<p>15 Thus shalt thou do unto all the civitates which are very far off from thee, which are not of the civitates of these gentes.</p>
<p>16 But of the civitates of these gentes, which the Lord thy Deus doth give thee in hereditatem, thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth:</p>
<p>17 But thou shalt utterly destroy them; namely, the Hittites, and the Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; as the Lord thy Deus hath commanded thee:</p>
<p>18 That they teach you not to do after all their abominationes, which they have done unto their diis; so should ye sin contra the Lord your Deus.</p>
<p>19 When thou shalt besiegium a civitas a long time, in fighting contra it to take it, thou shalt not destroy the lignum thereof by forcing an axe against it: for thou mayest eat of it, and thou shalt not cut it down (for the lignum of the field is homo's life) to employ them in the obsidio:</p>
<p>20 Only the lignum which thou knowest that it is not a lignum for meat, thou shalt destroy and cut down; and thou shalt build bulwarks against the civitas that maketh war with thee, until it be subdued.</p>
<p>21 Furthermore the sanguis of the innocent erit upon thee, if thou hide the homicida, whom thou shalt know to be a homicida, or if thou wilt not reveal him, when thou art questioned of the magistratus.</p>
<p>22 If one be found mortuus in the terra which the Lord thy Deus giveth thee to possess it, lying in the ager, and it be not known who hath occisus him:</p>
<p>23 Then thy seniores and thy judges shall come forth, and they shall measure unto the civitates which are round about him that is mortuus:</p>
<p>24 And it shall be, that the civitas which is next unto the mortuus, even the seniores of that civitas shall take an vitula of the armentum, which hath not been wrought with, and which hath not drawn in the jugum;</p>
<p>25 And the seniores of that civitas shall bring down the vitula unto a vallis rough and stony, where is neither sown nor planted; and they shall strike off the caput of the vitula there:</p>
<p>26 And the sacerdotes the filii of Levi shall come nigh; for them the Lord thy Deus hath chosen to minister unto him, and to bless in the nomine of the Lord; and by their word shall every controversia and every plagium be tried:</p>
<p>27 And all the seniores of that civitas, that are next unto the mortuus, shall wash their manus over the vitula that is occisa in the vallis:</p>
<p>28 And they shall say, Our manus have not shed this sanguis, neither have our oculi seen it.</p>
<p>29 Forgive, O Lord, thy populus Israel, whom thou hast redeemed, and lay not innocent sanguis in the medio of thy populus Israel. And the sanguis shall be forgiven them.</p>
<p>20 So shalt thou put away the innocent sanguis from among you, when thou shalt do that which is rectum in the oculi of the Lord.</p>
