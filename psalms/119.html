                    <p>Aleph. Blessed are the undefiled in via, who walk in the lex of the Lord.</p>
<p>Blessed are they that keep testimonia, and that seek him with the whole cor.</p>
<p>Who also do no iniquitas, but walk in viis ejus.</p>
<p>Thou hast commanded us to custodire mandata, that we might observe them diligenter.</p>
<p>O that my via were directed to custodire thy statuta!</p>
<p>Then shall I not be confusus, when I have respectus to all thy commandamenta.</p>
<p>I will praise thee with rectus cor, when I shall have learned judicia tua.</p>
<p>I will keep thy statuta: O forsake me not utterly.</p>
<p>Beth. Wherewithal shall a juvenile purify his via, to keep it according to thy verbum?</p>
<p>With the whole cor, I have sought thee: O let me not err from thy commandamenta.</p>
<p>Thy verbum have I hid in cor meum, that I might not peccare against thee.</p>
<p>Blessed art thou, O Lord: doce me thy statuta.</p>
<p>With my lips have I declared all the judicia of thy os.</p>
<p>I have delighted in the via of thy testimonia, as in all divitiae.</p>
<p>I will meditari in thy praecepta, and have respectus to thy vias.</p>
<p>I will delitescere in thy statuta: I will not forget thy verbum.</p>
<p>Gimel. Deal bountifully with thy servus, that I may vivere and keep thy verbum.</p>
<p>Open my oculi, that I may see wondrous things out of thy lex.</p>
<p>I am a peregrinus in terra: hide not thy commandamenta from me.</p>
<p>My animus breaketh for the desire to thy judicia at all tempora.</p>
<p>Thou hast rebuked the proud, and cursed the qui declinant from thy commandamenta.</p>
<p>Remove from me reprobum, and contumeliam: for I will keep thy testimonia.</p>
<p>Princes also did sit and speak against me: but thy servus did meditari in thy statuta.</p>
<p>Also thy testimonia are my deliciae, and my consiliarii.</p>
<p>Daleth. My animus cleaveth to the terra: quicken me according to thy verbum.</p>
<p>I have declared my vias, and thou heardest me: doce me thy statuta.</p>
<p>Make me to understand the via of thy commandamenta: so shall I meditari in thy wondrous works.</p>
<p>My animus melteth for heaviness: strengthen me according to thy verbum.</p>
<p>Remove from me the via of mendacium, and graciously grant me thy lex.</p>
<p>I have chosen the via of veritas: thy judicia have I laid before me.</p>
<p>I have stuck to thy testimonia: O Lord, forsake me not utterly.</p>
<p>I will run the way of thy commandamenta, when thou shalt enlarge my cor.</p>
<p>He. Teach me, O Lord, the via of thy statuta; and I shall keep it unto the finis.</p>
<p>Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy lex; yea, I shall observe it with the whole cor.</p>
<p>Make me to go in the via of thy commandamenta; for therein is my delicia.</p>
<p>Incline my cor to testimonium, and not to avaritia.</p>
<p>Turn away mine oculi from beholding vanitas, and quicken me in the via of thy verbum.</p>
<p>Stabilis thy verbum in thy servus, who is devoted to thy fear.</p>
<p>Turn away my reprobum: for I will keep thy testimonia.</p>
<p>Behold, I have longed after thy praecepta: quicken me in thy justitia.</p>
<p>Vau. Let thy misericordia come also unto me, O Lord, even thy salus, according to thy verbum.</p>
<p>So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me: for I trust in thy verbum.</p>
<p>And take not the verbum of thy veritas utterly out of my os; for I have hoped in thy judicia.</p>
<p>So shall I keep thy lex continually for ever and ever.</p>
<p>And I will walk in libertas: for I seek thy praecepta.</p>
<p>I will speak of thy testimonia also before kings, and will not be confusus.</p>
<p>I will delitescere also in thy commandamenta, which I have loved.</p>
<p>My manus also will I lift up unto thy commandamenta, which I have loved; and I will meditari in thy statuta.</p>
<p>Remember the verbum unto thy servus, upon which thou hast caused me to hope.</p>
<p>This is my delicia in my afflictio: for thy verbum hath quickened me.</p>
<p>The proud have had me in derisum: for I kept not thy verbum.</p>
<p>I remembered thy judicia of old, O Lord; and have comforted myself.</p>
<p>Indignatio hath taken hold upon me, because of the wicked who forsake thy lex.</p>
<p>Thy statuta have been my canores in the domus of my peregrination.</p>
<p>I have remembered thy nominis, O Lord, in the nocte, and have kept thy lex.</p>
<p>This I had, because I kept thy praecepta.</p>
<p>Zain. Thou art my portio, O Lord: I have said that I would keep thy verba.</p>
<p>I entreated thy faciem with the whole cor: have mercy upon me according to thy verbum.</p>
<p>I considered my vias, and turned my pedes unto thy testimonia.</p>
<p>I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandamenta.</p>
<p>The bands of the wicked have robbed me: but I have not forgotten thy lex.</p>
<p>At media nocte I will rise to give gratias unto thee because of thy justa judicia.</p>
<p>I am companion to all who fear thee, and to those who keep thy praecepta.</p>
<p>The terra, O Lord, is full of thy misericordia: doce me thy statuta.</p>
<p>Thou hast dealt well with thy servus, O Lord, according unto thy verbum.</p>
<p>Doce me bonitatem, and disciplinam, and scientiam: for I have credidit in thy commandamenta.</p>
<p>Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now I have kept thy verbum.</p>
<p>Thou art bonus, and in bonitate doce me thy statuta.</p>
<p>The proud have forged a falsitas against me: but I will keep thy praecepta with the whole cor.</p>
<p>Their cor is as fat as grease; but I delitescere in thy lex.</p>
<p>It is bonus for me that I have been in afflictio; that I might learn thy statuta.</p>
<p>The lex of thy os is better unto me than mille auri et argenti.</p>
<p>Koph. Thy manus have made me and fashioned me: give me understanding, that I may learn thy commandamenta.</p>
<p>They that fear thee will see me and be glad; because I have hoped in thy verbum.</p>
<p>I know, O Lord, that thy judicia are justa, and that thou in fidelitate hast afflicted me.</p>
<p>I beseech thee, let thy facies be for bonum in me, that I may be strengthened, according to thy verbum.</p>
<p>Let my os be filled with thy laudibus; and with thy laudem all the die.</p>
<p>For I will teach thy judicia before kings, and will not be confusus.</p>
<p>I will lift up my manus also unto thy commandamenta, which I have loved; and I will meditari in thy statuta.</p>
<p>I will remember thy nominis, O Lord, in the nocte, and will keep thy lex.</p>
<p>This I had, because I kept thy praecepta.</p>
<p>Resh. My pedes have kept thy testimonia, and I have not been confusus.</p>
<p>I have called upon thy judicia, O Lord; and thou hast answered me: doce me thy statuta.</p>
<p>Make me to understand the via of thy praecepta: so shall I meditari in thy wondrous works.</p>
<p>My animus melteth for heaviness: strengthen me according to thy verbum.</p>
<p>Remove from me the via of mendacium, and graciously grant me thy lex.</p>
<p>I have chosen the via of veritas: thy judicia have I laid before me.</p>
<p>I have stuck to thy testimonia: O Lord, forsake me not utterly.</p>
<p>I will run the way of thy commandamenta, when thou shalt enlarge my cor.</p>
<p>Schin. Teach me, O Lord, the via of thy statuta; and I shall keep it unto the finis.</p>
<p>Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy lex; yea, I shall observe it with the whole cor.</p>
<p>Make me to go in the via of thy commandamenta; for therein is my delicia.</p>
<p>Incline my cor to testimonium, and not to avaritia.</p>
<p>Turn away mine oculi from beholding vanitas, and quicken me in the via of thy verbum.</p>
<p>Stabilis thy verbum in thy servus, who is devoted to thy fear.</p>
<p>Turn away my reprobum: for I will keep thy testimonia.</p>
<p>Behold, I have longed after thy praecepta: quicken me in thy justitia.</p>
<p>Tau. Thou art bonus, and in bonitate doce me thy statuta.</p>
<p>The proud have forged a falsitas against me: but I will keep thy praecepta with the whole cor.</p>
<p>Their cor is as fat as grease; but I delitescere in thy lex.</p>
