                    <p>My filius, forget not my doctrina, but let thine animus retain my verba of admonition.</p>
<p>For length of dies and long vita and pacem they shall add to thee.</p>
<p>Mercy and veritas preserve thee, so shall thy via directio be before the facies of Deum.</p>
<p>Trust in Deum with all thy cor, and lean not unto thine own intellegentia.</p>
<p>In omni via tua acknowledge Him, and He shall direct thy semitas.</p>
<p>Be not sapiens in thine own oculi, fear Deum and decline from malum.</p>
<p>Then shall thy venter be delighted, and thy ossa shall be made robustus.</p>
<p>Honora Deum with the substantia of thy facultas and with the primitias of all thy fruges.</p>
<p>So shall thy horreum be replenished with abundantia, and thy presses shall burst out with vinum novum.</p>
<p>My filius, despise not the disciplina of Deum, neither be thou weary of His correction.</p>
<p>For quem Deum diligit castigat, and as a pater the filius in whom He delights.</p>
<p>Blessed is the homo that findeth sapientia and the homo that getteth intellegentia.</p>
<p>For the mercimonium of it is better than the mercimonium of argentum, and the fructus of it better than aurum fructus.</p>
<p>Length of vita is in dextera eius, in sinistra sua divitiae and honos.</p>
<p>Viae of her are viae of dulcedo, and omnes semitae of her pacificae.</p>
<p>She is a lignum of vita to them that lay hold upon her, and happy is every uno that retaineth her.</p>
<p>Deus per sapientiam fundavit terram, per intellegentia He hath established caelum.</p>
<p>Per scientia profundorum His voces the abyssus was made to be opened, and nebulae were made to descend rores.</p>
<p>My filius, let not them depart from thine oculi, keep sapientia and intellegentia.</p>
<p>So shall they be vita to thy animus and gratia to thy cervix.</p>
<p>Then shalt thou walk in via tua securus, and thy pes shall not offend.</p>
<p>When thou sleepest, thou shalt not be metus, and thy somnus shall be dulcis.</p>
<p>Thou shalt not be pavidus of subitaneus terror, nor of the potestas of impiorum which assallit terram.</p>
<p>For Deum shall be in custodia of thee, and shall keep thy pes from laqueus.</p>
<p>Non declines pedem tuum, si manus tua dederit te in manu Dei, et pone in Deum fiduciam tuam.</p>
<p>Noli aemulari in malo, neque desideres divitias impiorum.</p>
<p>For there is no futura spes to homini impius, but expectatio justi shall be gaudium.</p>
<p>Justus in aeternum non timebit, memoria autem impiorum interibit cum morte.</p>
<p>Justus quasi phoenix multiplicabitur, et sicut ros quae herbam irrigat.</p>
<p>Expectatio justi laetitiae, sed spes impiorum perdetur.</p>
