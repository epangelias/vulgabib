  "Therefore thou art inexcusable, O homo, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things.",
  "But we are sure that the judicium of God is according to veritas against them which commit such things.",
  "And thinkest thou this, O homo, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judicium of God?",
  "Or despisest thou the riches of his benignitas and patientia and longsuffering; not knowing that the benignitas of God leadeth thee to paenitentia?",
  "But after thy hardness and impenitent cor, treasurest up for thyself ira against the dies of ira and revelation of the just judicium of God;",
  "Who will render to every homo according to his opera.",
  "To them who by patientia in good opera seek for gloria and honor and immortalitas, eternal vita:",
  "But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the veritas, but obey injustitia, indignatio and ira;",
  "Tribulatio and angustia, upon every anima of homo that doth evil, of the Iudaeus first, and also of the Gentilis;",
  "But gloria, honor, and pax, to every homo that worketh good, to the Iudaeus first, and also to the Gentilis:",
  "For there is no respect of personas with God.",
  "For as many as have sinned without lex shall also perish without lex: and as many as have sinned in the lex shall be judged by the lex;",
  "For not the audientes of the lex are justi before God, but the doers of the lex shall be justified.",
  "For when the Gentiles, which have not the lex, do by natura the things contained in the lex, these, having not the lex, are a lex unto themselves:",
  "Which shew the opera of the lex written in their corda, their conscientia also bearing witness, and their cogitationes the meanwhile accusing or else excusing one another;)",
  "In the dies when God shall judge the secrets of homo by Iesus Christ according to my evangelium.",
  "Behold, thou art called a Iudaeus, and restest in the lex, and makest thy boast of God,",
  "And knowest his voluntas, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the lex;",
  "And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the caeci, a light of them which are in tenebris,",
  "An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the forma of knowledge and of the veritas in the lex.",
  "Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not furari, furaris:",
  "Thou that sayest a man should not adulterari, adulteras: thou that abhorrest idols, thou committest sacrilegium;",
  "Thou that makest thy boast of the lex, through breaking the lex dishonorest thou God?",
  "For the nomen of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.",
  "Circumcisio verily profiteth, if thou keep the lex: but if thou be a transgressor of the lex, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.",
  "Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the justa opera of the lex, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?",
  "And shall not uncircumcision which is by natura, if it fulfill the lex, judge thee, who by the littera and circumcision dost transgress the lex?",
  "For he is not a Iudaeus, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in carne:",
  "But he is a Iudaeus, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the cor, in spirit, not in littera; whose laus is not of homo, but of God."
