                    <p>A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth. O DOMINE, I have heard thy speech, and was afraid: O DOMINE, revive thy work in the midst of the anni, in the midst of the anni make known; in wrath remember misericordia.</p>
<p>DOMINE, his way is in the tempest, and his via in the whirlwind: and the nubes are the dust of his pedes.</p>
<p>He stood, and measured the terra: he beheld, and drove asunder the gentes: and the montes were scattered in his praesentia; his via are sempiternae.</p>
<p>I saw the tabernacula of Ethiopia before him, and the cortices of the terra of Madian did tremble.</p>
<p>Was DOMINE displeased against the flumina? was thy ira against the flumina? was thy indignatio against the mari? thou didst ride upon thy equi, and thy currus of salus.</p>
<p>Thy arcus was made quite naked, according to the oath of thy prophetica, of the reliquiae of the flumina. Thou didst cleave the terra with flumina.</p>
<p>The montes saw thee, and they trembled: the inundatio of the aqua passed by: the abysse gave vocem, and lifted up his manus on high.</p>
<p>Sol et luna stetit in suo habitaculo: in lumine sagittarum tuarum perambulasti, in lumine fulguris tuarum perambulasti.</p>
<p>Thou didst stride through the terra in indignation, thou didst thresh the gentes in ira.</p>
<p>Thou wentest forth for the salus of thy populus, for the salus of thy christus; thou hast percutis the caput of the domus malae, thou hast nudum caput a fundamentis usque ad verticem.</p>
<p>Thou hast vulneratus the caput of his domus malae, thou hast nudum caput a fundamentis usque ad verticem.</p>
<p>Thou hast peditatus the mari in equis, in the multisness of his undae.</p>
<p>I heard, and my viscera trembled: my lips trembled at the vox; rottenness entered into my ossa, and I trembled in my self, that I might rest in the dies of affliction, when he ascendit to the populus, he will percutis the locum.</p>
<p>Although the fig tree shall not florere, neither shall fructus be in the vineyards; the labor of the olivae shall faile, and the campos shall yielde no cibus; the flocke shall be cut off from the ovile, and there shall be no bovem in the stabulis:</p>
<p>Yet I will rejoice in DOMINE, I will joy in the Deus of my salus.</p>
<p>DOMINE Deus is my fortitudo, he will set my pedes upon the altitudes. He will make me to walke upon my ascensoria, for the conductor of my psalmi.</p>
