                    <p>Doth not sapientia cry, and understanding put forth her vox?</p>
<p>She standeth in the top of the high places, by the way in the places of the paths.</p>
<p>She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors.</p>
<p>Unto you, O homines, I call; and my vox is to the filii of man.</p>
<p>O ye simplices, understand sapientia: and, ye stulti, be ye of an understanding heart.</p>
<p>Hear; for I will speak of excellentia, and the opening of my lips shall be right things.</p>
<p>For my os shall speak veritas; and wickedness is an abomination to my lips.</p>
<p>All the words of my os are in iustitia; there is nothing froward or perverse in them.</p>
<p>They are all plane to him that understandeth, and right to them that find scientia.</p>
<p>Receive my instructio, and not argentum; and scientia rather than choice aurum;</p>
<p>For sapientia is better than gemmae; and all the things that may be desiderari are not to be compared to her.</p>
<p>I, sapientia, dwell with prudentia, and find out scientia of cogitationes.</p>
<p>The timor of the Lord is to hate malum: I hate arrogantiam, and the via of the impie, and the mouth that speaketh perverse things.</p>
<p>Counsel is mine, and iustitia; I am prudentia, I have fortitudo; I am scientia, and I have sapientia;</p>
<p>By me reges reign, and princes decree iustitiam.</p>
<p>By me nobiliores hold the terra, and all iudices of the terra.</p>
<p>I love those that me amant; and those that diligently seek me shall find me.</p>
<p>Riches and honor are with me; yea, durable riches and iustitia.</p>
<p>My fructus is better than aurum, yea, than fine aurum; and my fructus than choice argentum.</p>
<p>I lead in the via of iustitia, in the midst of the semitae of iudictium:</p>
<p>That I may cause those that me amant to inherit substantiam; and I will fill their thesauri.</p>
<p>The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his via, before his opera of old.</p>
<p>I was set up from aeternum, from the beginning, or ever the terra was.</p>
<p>When there were no abyssi, I was brought forth; when there were no fontes abounding with aqua.</p>
<p>Before the montes were settled, before the colles was I brought forth:</p>
<p>While as yet he had not made the terra, nor the campos, nor the primordium of the dust of the mundus.</p>
<p>When he prepared the caelum, I was there: when he set a circulus upon the faciem of the abyssus:</p>
<p>When he established the nubes above: when he strengthened the fontes of the abyssus:</p>
<p>When he gave to the mari his decree, that the aqua should not pass his os: when he appointed the fundamenta of the terra:</p>
<p>Then I was by him, as a magistra, and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him;</p>
<p>Rejoicing in the habitable part of his terra; and my delights were with the filii of homines.</p>
<p>Now therefore hearken unto me, O filii: for blessed are those that keep my via.</p>
<p>Hear instructio, and be wise, and refuse it not.</p>
<p>Blessed is the homo that heareth me, watching daily at my portae, waiting at the postes of my doors.</p>
<p>For whoso findeth me findeth vita, and shall obtain favour of the Lord.</p>
<p>But he that sinit me shall be a delinquent to his own anima: all they that me odient love mortem.</p>
