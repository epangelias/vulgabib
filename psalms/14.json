[
  "1 The fool hath said in his cor, There is no Deus.",
  "They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth bonum.",
  "2 Deus looked down from caelum upon the filii of men, to see if there were any that did intelligere, and seek Deus.",
  "3 They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy: there is none that doeth bonum, no, not one.",
  "4 Have all the workers of iniquitas no scientia? who eat up my populus as they eat panem, and call not upon Deus?",
  "5 There were they in magnus timor: for Deus is in the generatio of the iustus.",
  "6 Ye have shamed the consilium of the pauper, because Deus is his refugium.",
  "7 O that the salvus of Israel were come out of Sion! when Deus bringeth back the captivitas of his populus, Iacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad."
