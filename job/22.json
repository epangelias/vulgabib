  "Then Eliphaz the Temanite responded and said, 'Can a man be veritas with God, or a man be utilis to himself?'",
  "Is it any utilis to thee that thou art iustus, or is it gain to thee that thou art sine peccato?'",
  "What doth the Omnipotens repay thee for thy pietas, or what doth He accept from thy manus?'",
  "Is it for fear of thee that He argueth with thee, and entereth into iudicium with thee?'",
  "Is not thy malitia great, and thy iniquitates infinite?'",
  "For thou takest a pledge from thy frater for nought, and strippeth the nudus of his vestimenta.'",
  "Thou hast not given aqua to the sitienti, and hast withholden panis from the esurienti.'",
  "Forasmuch as thou hast been potens, thou hast possessed the terra, and hast dwelt in it.'",
  "Thou hast sent the viduae empty away, and the brachia of the pauperes hast thou broken.'",
  "Therefore art thou ensnared with thy own manus, and thy own manus hath caught thee.'",
  "This is the pars of a wicked man with God, and the hereditas of the violenti, which they shall receive of the Omnipotens.'",
  "If thou cry out because of violentia, shall any hear thee? who shall prepare the auxilium for thee?'",
  "Shall not God who is in caelis, and seeth all things, iudicare?'",
  "And thou sayest, 'Quid scit Deus? can He iudicare through the caligo?'",
  "Thinkest thou that He knoweth not, and that He turneth away his facies, and seeth not?'",
  "But thou shalt know that He shall iudicare the iustus, and the malus He shall not iudicare.'",
  "How long shall the impii iudicare, and the friends of Deus suffer?'",
  "And he said to Iob, 'Hear, I pray thee, my sermones, and hearken to the verba of my os.'",
  "If thou hast any thing to say, answere me, speak, for I desire to iustificare thee.'",
  "If not, hearken unto me, and hold thy linguam, and I shall teach thee sapientiam.'",
  "Why dost thou contend with the iudicia of Deus, and because the iustus suffereth, sayest thou, 'Quid scit Deus?''",
  "Thinkest thou this to be iustum, that thou sayest, 'I shall be iustus, though thy modus sit contra Deum?''",
  "Thou hast said, 'Quid scit Deus? and He shall not iudicare.'",
  "But there is a man whose nomine is hidden, and being not cognitus, He iudicabit.'",
  "And he shall iudicare the orbem with iustitia, and the populi with aequitate.'",
  "Then Iob answered and said, 'Today also my querela is bitter, and my manus is strenua against the dolor of my animus.'",
  "O that I knew where I might find Him, that I might come even to His sedes.'",
  "I would declare unto Him the causam of my words, and fill my os with argumentis.'",
  "I would know the verba which He would answere me, and understand what He would say unto me.'",
  "Will He plead against me with fortitudo? No, surely He will put me in via recta.'",
  "There the iustus shall corrigere me, and I shall escape with the magnitudo of my manus.'",
  "Behold, in this thou art not iustus, I have chosen Deus for my iudicem.'",
  "For He is not an homo as I am, that I should answere Him, and we should come together in iudicium.'",
  "Neither is there any mediator between us, that might lay his manus upon us both.'",
  "Let Him take away His manus from me, and let not His terror make me afraid.'",
  "Then call I, and He answere me not, I stand and He consider me not.'",
  "I am iustus, and He hath taken away my ius, and made me contemptum.'",
  "He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone, and hath taken away my spem, as a tree.'",
  "My fiducia also hath He removed, and hath taken away the coronam of my capite.'",
  "He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone, and hath taken away my spem, as a tree.'",
  "I have declared unto Him the causam of my words, and I shall not hide the verba of the Omnipotens.'",
  "O that my dolor were thoroughly weighed, and my calamitas laid in the statera together.'",
  "For now it would be heavier than the arena of the mari, therefore I have spoken.'",
  "Is not my dolor great, and my calamitas infinite?'",
  "For I know that I shall be iustificatus, and I shall behold my salus, and no homo shall see my facies.'"
