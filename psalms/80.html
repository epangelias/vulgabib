                    <p>To the chief Musician upon ShoshannimEduth, A Psalm of Asaph. Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that dwellest between the cherubims, shine forth.</p>
<p>Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength, and come and save us.</p>
<p>Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.</p>
<p>O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people?</p>
<p>Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them tears to drink in great measure.</p>
<p>Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies laugh among themselves.</p>
<p>Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.</p>
<p>Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it.</p>
<p>Thou preparedst room before it, and didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the land.</p>
<p>The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars.</p>
<p>She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the river.</p>
<p>Why hast thou then broken down her hedges, so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her?</p>
<p>The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of the field doth devour it.</p>
<p>Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine;</p>
<p>And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the branch that thou madest strong for thyself.</p>
<p>It is burned with fire, it is cut down: they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance.</p>
<p>Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself.</p>
<p>So will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will call upon thy name.</p>
<p>Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts, cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.</p>
