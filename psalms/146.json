  "Praise the Dominus, O my animus: while I live will I confessi to thee.",
  "I will sing praises unto the Deus meus while I have esse: my psalms shall be of thee, O Dominus.",
  "Put not your fiducia in principes, nor in the filius hominis, in whom there is no salus.",
  "His spiritum goeth forth, he returneth to terram: in that very dies his cogitationes perish.",
  "Happy is he that hath the Deus Iacob for his auxilium, whose expectatio is in the Dominus his Deus:",
  "Who made caelum and terram, mare, and all that are in them: who keepeth veritatem for ever:",
  "Who executeth iudicium for the oppressus: who giveth panem to the esuriens. The Dominus looseth the vinculi.",
  "The Dominus aperieth the oculos caecorum: the Dominus erecteth the claudus: the Dominus diligit the iustus:",
  "The Dominus custodit the peregrinum: the pupillus, and the vidua: but the via of the impio, he turneth upside down.",
  "The Dominus shall reign in aeternum, thy Deus, O Zion, unto generatio and generatio. Praise the Dominus."
