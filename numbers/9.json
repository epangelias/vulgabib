  "And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first mensis of the second year after they were come out of the land of Aegypt, saying,",
  "Let the children of Israel also keep the passover at his appointed tempus.",
  "In the fourteenth dies of this mensis, at even, ye shall keep it in his appointed tempus: according to all the rites of it, and according to all the ceremonias thereof, shall ye keep it.",
  "And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should keep the passover.",
  "And they kept the passover on the fourteenth dies of the first mensis at even in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel.",
  "And there were certain homines, who were immundi by the corpus of a homo, and could not keep the passover on that dies: therefore they came before Moses and before Aaron on that dies:",
  "And those homines said unto him, We are immundi by the corpus of a homo: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer an oblation unto the LORD in his appointed tempus among the children of Israel?",
  "And Moses said unto them, Stand aside, and I will hear what the LORD will command concerning you.",
  "And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,",
  "Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any homo of you or of your posteritas shall be immundi by reason of a corpus, or be in a long journey, he shall still keep the passover unto the LORD.",
  "The fourteenth dies of the second mensis at even they shall keep it, and eat it with unleavened panis and bitter herbas:",
  "They shall leave none of it unto the mane, nor break any bone of it: according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it.",
  "But the homo that is clean, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same anima shall be cut off from among his populus: because he brought not the oblation of the LORD in his appointed tempus, that homo shall bear his peccatum.",
  "And if a proselyte shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover unto the LORD; according to the ordinance of the passover, and according to the ritus thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have one ritus, both for the proselyte, and for him that was born in the land.",
  "And on the dies that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimonium: and at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of ignis, until mane.",
  "So it was alway: the cloud covered it by die, and the appearance of ignis by nocte.",
  "And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud rested, there the children of Israel pitched their castra.",
  "At the commandement of the LORD the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandement of the LORD they pitched: as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their castra.",
  "And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many dies, then the children of Israel kept the ordinance of the LORD, and journeyed not.",
  "And so it was, when the cloud was a few dies upon the tabernacle; according to the commandement of the LORD they abode in their castra, and according to the commandement of the LORD they journeyed.",
  "And so it was, when the cloud abode from even unto mane, and that the cloud was taken up in the mane, then they journeyed: whether it was by die, or by nocte, that the cloud was taken up, they journeyed.",
  "Or whether it were two dies, or a mensis, or a year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the children of Israel abode in their castra, and journeyed not; but when it was taken up, they journeyed.",
  "At the commandement of the LORD they rested in their castra, and at the commandement of the LORD they journeyed: they kept the ordinance of the LORD, at the commandement of the LORD by the hand of Moses."
