                    <p>And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of the templum of the Lord, and the regia domus, and all Solomon's desiderium which he was pleased to do,</p>
<p>That the Lord appeared to Solomon the secundus time, as He was appeared unto him at Gibeon.</p>
<p>And the Lord said unto Solomon, Because thy cor has been as this, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the animus of thine enemies, neither hast thou asked long life; but hast asked sapientia and scientia for thyself, that thou mayest iudicare my people, over whom I have made thee rex:</p>
<p>Wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee; and I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honour, such as none of the reges have had that have been before thee, neither shall there any after thee have the like.</p>
<p>But if thou shalt turn away from following me, thou and thy filii, and not keep my mandata and my iudicia, which I have set before thee, but shalt go and serve other dii, and worship them:</p>
<p>Then will I cut off Israel out of the terra which I have given them; and this templum, which I have hallowed for my nomen, will I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people:</p>
<p>And at this templum, whether it be high or whether it be low, every oculus that looketh upon it shall be dolorous; and every cor shall be dolorous, and they shall say, Why hath the Lord done thus unto this terra, and unto this templum?</p>
<p>And they shall answer, Because they forsook the Lord their Deus, which brought forth their patres out of Aegyptum, and have taken hold upon other dii, and have worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath the Lord brought upon them all this malum.</p>
<p>And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had built the two domus, the templum of the Lord and the regia domus,</p>
<p>That the urbs which Huram had restored to Solomon, Solomon built them, and caused the filii Israel to dwell there.</p>
<p>And Solomon went to Hamath-zobah, and prevailed against it.</p>
<p>And he built Tadmor in the desert, and all the urbes of store which he built in Hamath.</p>
<p>Also he built Beth-horon the upper, and Beth-horon the nether, urbes of defence, with walls, portae, and bars;</p>
<p>And Baalath, and all the urbes of store that Solomon had, and all the urbes of the currus, and the urbes of the equites, and all that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Libano, and throughout all the terra of his dominion.</p>
<p>As for all the people that were left of the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which were not of the filii Israel,</p>
<p>Their filii that were left after them in the terra, whom the filii Israel also were not able utterly to destroy, upon those did Solomon lay a tributum of servitium unto this day.</p>
<p>But of the filii Israel did Solomon make no servos: but they were homines of war, and chief of his principes, and captains of his currus and his equites.</p>
<p>These were the principes of Solomon's officiums, even two hundred and fifty, that bare rule over the people.</p>
<p>And Solomon brought up the filia of Pharaoh out of the urbs of David unto the domus that he had built for her: for he said, My uxor shall not dwell in the domus of David rex of Israel, because the places are sancti, into which the arca of the Lord hath come.</p>
