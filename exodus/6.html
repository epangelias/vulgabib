                    <p>Then the Lord said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh: for with a strong manus he shall let them go, and with a strong manus shall he drive them out of his terra.</p>
<p>These be the heads of their patres houses: The sons of Reuben the primus filius of Israel; Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi: these be the familias of Reuben.</p>
<p>And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the filius of a Canaanitissa.</p>
<p>And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari: and the years of the vita of Levi were centum triginta septem anni.</p>
<p>And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel: and the years of the vita of Kohath were centum triginta tres anni.</p>
<p>And Amram took him Jochebed his soror to wife; and she bare him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the vita of Amram were centum triginta septem anni.</p>
<p>And the filia of Levi, whom she bare unto Levi in Egypt, bare unto him Libni, and Shimi, according to their familias.</p>
<p>These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom the Lord said, Bring out the filii of Israel from the terra of Egypt according to their exercitus.</p>
<p>These are they which spake to Pharaoh rex of Egypt, to bring out the filii of Israel from Egypt: these are that Moses and Aaron.</p>
<p>And it came to pass on the die when the Lord spake unto Moses in the terra of Egypt, That the Lord said unto Moses, I am the Lord: speak thou unto Pharaoh rex of Egypt all that I say unto thee.</p>
<p>But Moses said before the Lord, Behold, I am of impeded speechis: how then shall Pharaoh hear me?</p>
<p>And the Lord said unto Moses, See, I have made thee Deus unto Pharaoh: and Aaron thy frater shall be thy propheta.</p>
<p>Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and Aaron thy frater shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the filii of Israel out of his terra.</p>
<p>And Moses spake before the Lord, saying, Behold, the filii of Israel have not heard me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, seeing I am of impeded speechis?</p>
<p>And the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, and gave them a mandatum unto the filii of Israel, and unto Pharaoh rex of Egypt, to bring the filii of Israel out of the terra of Egypt.</p>
