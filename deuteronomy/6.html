                    <p>1. Hear, O Israel: The Lord our Deus is one Lord: 2. Thou shalt love the Lord thy Deus with all thine heart, and with all thy animus, and with all thy fortitudo, and with all thy mens.</p>
<p>3. And these verba, which I command thee this day, shall be in thy cor, 4. And thou shalt scribere them upon the postes of thy domus, and on thy portae.</p>
<p>5. And thou shalt docere them diligently unto thy filii, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thy domus, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.</p>
<p>6. And thou shalt ligare them for a sign upon thy manus, and they shall be as frontalia between thine oculi.</p>
<p>7. And thou shalt scribere them upon the postes of thy domus, and on thy portae.</p>
<p>8. That thy dies may be multiplied, and the dies of thy filii, in the terra which the Lord sware unto thy patres to give them, as the dies of the caelum upon the terra.</p>
<p>9. When the Lord thy Deus shall bring thee into the terra which he sware unto thy patres, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give thee great and good civitates, which thou buildedst not,</p>
<p>10. And houses full of all bona things, which thou filledst not, and cisternae digged, which thou diggedst not, vineae and olivetae, which thou plantedst not; when thou shalt have eaten and be full;</p>
<p>11. Then beware lest thou forget the Lord, who brought thee forth out of the terra of Aegyptus, from the domus of servitudo.</p>
<p>12. Thou shalt fear the Lord thy Deus, and serve him, and shalt iurare by his nomine.</p>
<p>13. Thou shalt not sequi after other dii, of the dii of the gentes which are round about thee;</p>
<p>14. For the Lord thy Deus is a Deus zelosus among you, lest the indignatio of the Lord thy Deus be kindled against thee, and destroy thee from off the facies of the terra.</p>
<p>15. Ye shall not temptare the Lord your Deus, as ye tempted him in Massa.</p>
<p>16. Ye shall not temptare the Lord your Deus, as ye tempted him in Temptatione.</p>
<p>17. Ye shall diligently keep the mandata of the Lord your Deus, and his testimonium, and his statuta, which he hath commanded thee.</p>
<p>18. And thou shalt do that which is rectum and bonum in the oculi of the Lord thy Deus, that it may be bene with thee, and that thou mayest go in and possess the bona terra which the Lord sware unto thy patres,</p>
<p>19. To cast out all thine inimici from before thee, as the Lord hath spoken.</p>
<p>20. And when thy filius asketh thee in tomorrow, saying, What mean the testimonium, and the statuta, and the iudicia, which the Lord our Deus hath commanded you?</p>
<p>21. Then thou shalt say unto thy filius, We were Pharaonis servi in Aegypto; and the Lord brought us out of Aegypto with a manus potens:</p>
<p>22. And the Lord shewed signs and miracula magna and malum before the oculi of Pharaonis, and before the oculi of his servorum, and before the oculi of all Aegypti:</p>
<p>23. And he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in, to give us the terra which he sware unto our patres.</p>
<p>24. And the Lord commanded us to do all these statuta, to fear the Lord our Deus, for our bonum always, that he might preserve us in vita, as it is this day.</p>
<p>25. And it shall be our iustitia, if we observe to do all these mandata before the Lord our Deus, as he hath commanded us.</p>
