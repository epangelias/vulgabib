  "But of the times and the seasons, brevitas (shortness) and the instant, brethren, ye have no necessitas (need) that I write unto you.",
  "For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Dominus (Lord) so cometh as a thief in noctem (night).",
  "When they shall say, Pax (peace) and tranquililitas (safety); then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escapere (escape).",
  "But ye, brethren, are not in tenebrae (darkness), that that day should overtake you as a thief.",
  "Ye are all the filii (children) of lucem (light), and the filii (children) of the diei (day): we are not of noctem (night), nor of tenebrae (darkness).",
  "Therefore let us not dormire (sleep), as do others; but let us vigilia (watch) and be sobrii (sober).",
  "For they that dormiunt (sleep) dormiunt noctu (sleep by night); and they that ebrii (are drunken) are ebrii noctu (are drunken by night).",
  "But let us, who are of the diei (day), be sobrii (sober), putting on the loricam (breastplate) of fides (faith) and amoris (love); and for an helmet, the spem (hope) of salvation.",
  "For God hath not appointed us to iram (wrath), but to obtain salutem (salvation) by our Dominus (Lord) Jesus Christ,",
  "Who died for us, that, whether we wake or dormiamus (sleep), we should live together with him.",
  "Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edificate (edify) one another, even as also ye do.",
  "And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Dominus (Lord), and admonish you;",
  "And to esteem them very highly in amoris (love) for their opera (work's) sake. And be at pax (peace) among yourselves.",
  "Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the fideles (faithful), support the infirmos (weak), be patient towards all men.",
  "See that none render malum (evil) for malum (evil); but ever follow that which is bonum (good), both among yourselves, and to all men.",
  "Rejoice evermore.",
  "Pray without cessatio (ceasing).",
  "In omnibus gratias agite (in everything give thanks): for this is the voluntas (will) of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.",
  "Quench not the Spirit.",
  "Despise not propheticum (prophecies).",
  "Prove all things; hold fast that which is bonum (good).",
  "Abstain from all malum (evil).",
  "The Deus (God) of pax (peace) sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and anima (soul) and corpus (body) be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Dominus (Lord) Jesus Christ."
