                    <p>And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beersheba, and offered sacrificia to Deus pater of his father Isaac.</p>
<p>And Deus appeared unto Israel in a visio nocturna, and said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I.</p>
<p>And he said, I am Deus, Deus of thy father: fear not to descend into Aegyptum; for I will there make thee into a great gens.</p>
<p>And Jacob rose up from Beersheba: and the filii of Israel carried Jacob their pater, and their parvuli, and their mulieres, in the carrucis which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.</p>
<p>And they took their greges, and their substantia, which they had acquired in terra Chanaan, and came into Aegyptum, Jacob, and all his semen with him:</p>
<p>His filii, and the filii of his filii with him, his filiae, and the filiae of his filii with him, and all his semen brought he with him into Aegyptum.</p>
<p>And these are the nomina of the filii of Israel, who came into Aegyptum, Jacob and his domus:</p>
<p>Reuben, the primogenitus of Jacob; the filii of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and Carmi.</p>
<p>The filii of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the filius of a Canaanitissa.</p>
<p>And the filii of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.</p>
<p>And the filii of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and Zarah: but Er and Onan died in terra Chanaan. And the filii of Pharez were Hezron, and Hamul.</p>
<p>The filii of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and Shimron.</p>
<p>And the filii of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.</p>
<p>These be the filii of Leah, whom she bare unto Jacob in Paddan-aram, with Dinah the filia of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob: all the animae of his filii and filiae were thirty and three.</p>
<p>And the filii of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli.</p>
<p>And the filii of Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and Beriah, and Serah their soror: and the filii of Beriah; Heber, and Malchiel.</p>
<p>These are the filii of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his filia, and these she bare unto Jacob; even sixteen animae.</p>
<p>The filii of Rachel Jacob's uxor; Joseph, and Benjamin.</p>
<p>And unto Joseph in terra Aegypti were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath the filia of Potipherah sacerdos of On bare unto him.</p>
<p>And the filii of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.</p>
<p>These are the filii of Rachel, which were born to Jacob: all the animae were fourteen.</p>
<p>And the filii of Bilhah Rachel's ancilla; Dan, and Naphtali.</p>
<p>And the filii of Dan; Hushim.</p>
<p>And the filii of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem.</p>
<p>These are the filii of Bilhah, whom Laban gave unto Rachel his filia, and she bare these unto Jacob: all the animae were seven.</p>
<p>All the animae that came with Jacob into Aegyptum, which came out of his lumbus, besides Jacob's uxor filii, were sixty and six;</p>
<p>And the filii of Joseph, which were born him in terra Aegypti, were two animae: all the animae of the domus of Jacob, which came into Aegyptum, were seventy.</p>
<p>And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his facies unto Gosen, and they came into terra Gosen.</p>
<p>And Joseph made ready his currus, and went up to meet Israel his pater, unto Gosen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell on his collum, and wept on his collum a good while.</p>
<p>And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me mori, since I have seen thy facies, because thou art yet vivus.</p>
<p>And Joseph said unto his fratres, and unto the domus of his pater, I will ascend, and adnuntiate Pharaoni, and say unto him, My fratres, and the domus of my pater, which were in terra Chanaan, are come unto me;</p>
<p>And the homines are pastores, and their negotium is to feed animas; and they have brought their ovium, and their boves, and all that they have.</p>
<p>And it shall be, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What is your negotium?</p>
<p>That ye shall say, Thy servos have been pastores from their iuventus even until now, both we, and also our patres: that ye may dwell in terra Gosen; for every pastor is abominatio to Aegyptios.</p>
