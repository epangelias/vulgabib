  "1 Then came the word of the Dominus unto me, saying, 2 Son of homo, What is the lignum of the vine more than any lignum, the virga that is among the ligna of the silva?",
  "3 Shall lignum be taken thereof to do any work? or will men take a peg of it to hang any vessel thereon?",
  "4 Behold, it is cast into ignis for fuel; the flamma hath devoured both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned. Is it meet for any work?",
  "5 Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less shall it be meet yet for any work, when the ignis hath devoured it, and it is burned?",
  "6 Therefore thus saith the Dominus Deus; As the lignum of the vine among the ligna of the silva, which I have given to the ignis for fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of Hierusalem.",
  "7 And I will set my facies against them; they shall go out from one ignis, and another ignis shall devor them; and ye shall know that I am the Dominus, when I set my facies against them.",
  "8 And I will make the terram desolate, because they have committed scelus, saith the Dominus Deus."
