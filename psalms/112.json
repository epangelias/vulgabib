  "Blessed is the homo, that feareth the Dominus, that delighteth greatly in his mandata.",
  "His seed shall be mighty upon terra, the generatio of the recti shall be blessed.",
  "Wealth and richesse shall be in his domus: and his iustitia endureth for ever and ever.",
  "Unto the iustus there ariseth lumen in tenebris: he is gracilis, and miseratur, and iustus.",
  "A benevolent homo, and lender, that dispenses his negotia with discretion: for he shall never be moved.",
  "The malus shall not be able to resist him: but the iusti shall be in memoriam aeternam.",
  "He shall not be afraid of malum tidings: his cor is fixed, trusting in the Domine.",
  "His cor is established, he shall not be afraid, until he see his desideria upon his enemies.",
  "He hath dispersed, he hath given to the pauper: his iustitia remaineth for ever; his cornu shall be exalted with gloria.",
  "The peccator shall see it, and be angry, he shall gnash with his dentes, and melt away: the desideria of the peccatores shall perish."
