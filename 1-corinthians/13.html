                    <p>Though I speak with the lingua of homines and of angelos, and have not caritas, I am become as sounding aes, or a tinkling cymbalum.</p>
<p>And though I have prophetiam, and understand omnes mysteria, and omne scientiam; and though I have fidem, so that I could remove montes, and have not caritas, I am nihil.</p>
<p>And though I bestow on the pauperes all my facultas, and though I tradam my corpus, ut ardeam, and have not caritas, it profiteth me nihil.</p>
<p>Caritas suffereth long, and is benigna; caritas enviieth not; caritas vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,</p>
<p>Doth not behave itself invidiose, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no malum;</p>
<p>Rejoiceth not in iniquitate, but rejoiceth in veritate;</p>
<p>Beareth omnes, believeth omnes, hopeth omnes, endureth omnes.</p>
<p>Caritas never faileth; but whether there be prophetiae, they shall fail; whether there be linguae, they shall cessare; whether there be scientia, it shall destroy itself;</p>
<p>For we know in parte, and we prophesy in parte.</p>
<p>But when that which is perfectum is come, then that which is in parte shall be done away.</p>
<p>When I was puer, I spake as puer, I understood as puer, I thought as puer; but when I became vir, I put away puerilia.</p>
<p>For now we see per speculum in aenigmate; but then face to face; now I know in parte; but then shall I know, even as I am known.</p>
<p>And now abideth fides, spes, caritas, these three; but the greatest of these is caritas.</p>
