                    <p>Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of Deus may have free course, and be glorified, even as it is with you:</p>
<p>And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all men have not fides.</p>
<p>But the Lord is fidelis, who shall stablish you, and keep you from malum.</p>
<p>And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do and will do the things which we command you.</p>
<p>And the Lord direct your cordia into the caritas of God, and into the patientia of Christ.</p>
<p>For our brethren's sake, we had written unto you briefly, to work with your own manus, as we commanded you;</p>
<p>That ye be not disorderly, and that ye do business, and work with your own manus, as we also commanded you;</p>
<p>That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and that ye may have need of nothing.</p>
<p>But we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;</p>
<p>And to esteem them very highly in amor for their work's sake. And be at pax among yourselves.</p>
<p>Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the fainthearted, support the weak, be patient toward all men.</p>
<p>See that none render malum for malum unto any man; but ever follow that which is bonum, both among yourselves and to all men.</p>
<p>Rejoice evermore, pray without ceasing, in omnibus gratias agite, this is the voluntas of Deus in Christ Jesus concerning you.</p>
<p>Quench not the Spirit, despise not propheticum, prove all things; hold fast that which is bonum.</p>
<p>Abstain from all form of malum, and the Deus of pax, that is, the Deus of sanitas, sanctify you wholly; and I pray Deus your whole spirit and anima and corpus be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it, to the finis, to the day of Jesus Christ;</p>
<p>To the brethren in Christ, with the pax and gratia of Deus our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Grace be unto you, and pax, from Deus our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
