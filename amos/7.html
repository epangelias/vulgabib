                    <p>Thus hath the Dominus Deus shewed unto me; and, behold, he formed locusts in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and, lo, it was the latter growth after the king's mowings.</p>
<p>And it came to pass, that when they had made an end of eating the herbage of the terra, then I said, O Domine Deus, forgive, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he is small.</p>
<p>The Domine Deus repented for this: It shall not be, saith the Domine Deus.</p>
<p>Thus hath the Dominus Deus shewed unto me: and, behold, the Domine Deus called to contend by fire, and it devoured the great abyss: and would have eaten up the inheritance of Jacob.</p>
<p>Then said I, O Domine Deus, cease, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he is small.</p>
<p>The Domine Deus repented for this: This also shall not be, saith the Domine Deus.</p>
<p>Thus he shewed me: and, behold, the Domine Deus stood upon a wall made by plumb-line, with a plumb-line in his hand.</p>
<p>And the Domine Deus said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A plumb-line. Then said the Domine Deus, Behold, I will set a plumb-line in the midst of my people Israel: I will not again pass by them any more:</p>
<p>And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the gladius.</p>
<p>Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the terra is not able to bear all his words.</p>
<p>For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the gladius, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own terra.</p>
<p>Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou vates, flee thee away into the terra of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there:</p>
<p>But prophesy not again any more at Bethel: for it is the king's sanctuarium, and it is the regia domus.</p>
<p>Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, neither was I a son of a prophet; but I was an armentarius, and a gatherer of sycomori.</p>
<p>And the Domine Deus took me as he found me, and went, and said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.</p>
<p>Now therefore hear thou the word of the Domine Deus: Thou sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not thy word against the house of Isaac.</p>
<p>Therefore thus saith the Domine Deus; Thy uxor shall be an meretrix in the urbs, and thy filii and thy filiae shall fall by the gladius, and thy terra shall be divided by the funiculus.</p>
<p>And thou shalt die in terra impia, and Israel shall surely go into captivitas forth of his own terra.</p>
