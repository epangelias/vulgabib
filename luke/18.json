  "And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his discipuli were with him: and he asked them, Quid vultis me facere?",
  "But they knew not what to respond, for timor had taken hold on them.",
  "And, behold, a certain homo, whose filius was possessed with a spiritus immundus, cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee, look on my filius: for he is mine unicus.",
  "And, lo, a spiritus takes him, and he suddenly cries out; and it tears him that he foams again, and bruising him hardly departs from him.",
  "And I besought thy discipuli to cast him out; and they could not.",
  "And Jesus answering said, O generatio incredula et perversa, how long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring thy filius hither.",
  "And as he was yet a coming, the daemonium rent him and convulsed him. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spiritus, and healed the puer, and delivered him again to his pater.",
  "And they were all astonisati at the magnificent virtus of God. But while they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said unto his discipuli,",
  "Let these sermones sink down into your aures: for the Filius hominis shall be delivered into the manus of homines.",
  "But they understood not this sermonem: and it was absconditus from them, that they perceived it not: and they feared to interrogate him of this sermonem.",
  "And there arose a disputatio among them, which of them should be the maior.",
  "But when Jesus saw the cogitationes of their corda, he took a puer, and set him by him,",
  "And said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this puer in my nomine, receives me: and whosoever shall receive me, receives him that sent me: for he that is minimus among you all, the same shall be magnus.",
  "And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out daemonia in thy nomine; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us.",
  "And Jesus said unto him, Forbid him not: for he that is not contra you is pro you.",
  "And it came to pass, when the tempus was come that he should be received up, he stetit in facie his itineris to go to Jerusalem,",
  "And sent messengers before his facies: and they went, and entered into a castellum of Samaritanorum, to make ready for him.",
  "And they did not receive him, because his facies was as though he would go to Jerusalem.",
  "And when his discipuli James and John saw this, they said, Domine, vis we command ignem to descend from caelum, and consume them, even as Elias did?",
  "But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, You know not what spiritus you are of.",
  "For the Filius hominis is not come to perdere animas, but to salvare them. And they went to another castellum.",
  "And it came to pass, that, as they went in the via, a certain homo said unto him, Domine, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.",
  "And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have dens, and aves of the caelum have nests; but the Filius hominis hath not where to lay his caput.",
  "And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Domine, permit me first to go and sepelire my pater.",
  "Jesus said unto him, Let the mortui sepelire their mortuos: but go thou and announce the regnum of Deum.",
  "And another also said, Domine, I will follow thee; but let me first bid farewell to them which are in my domus.",
  "Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his manus to the aratrum, and looking back, is aptus for the regnum of Deum."
