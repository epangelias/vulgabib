  "And Paul, earnestly beholding the concilium, said, Men and brethren, I have lived in omnis bona conscientia before Deus until this day.",
  "And the tribunus commanded him to be brought into the castra, saying that he should be examined by the flagellum, that he might know wherefore they cried so against him.",
  "And as they bound him with ligis, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it licitum to flagellate a Roman citizen, and uncondemned?",
  "When the centurion heard that, he went and told the tribunus, saying, Take heed what thou dost: for this man is a civis Romanus.",
  "Then the tribunus came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a civis Romanus? He said, Yea.",
  "And the tribunus answered, With a grande summa obtained I this civitas. And Paul said, But I was born a civis Romanus.",
  "And they, who were about to examine him, immediately departed from him: and the tribunus also was afraid, after he knew that he was a civis Romanus, and because he had bound him.",
  "On the morrow, because he would have known the certitudo wherefore he was accused of the Iudaei, he loosed him from vinculis, and commanded the principes of the sacerdotes and all their concilium to appear, and bringing Paul down, set him among them.",
  "And Paul, knowing that part of them were Sadducaei, and the other part Pharisaei, cried out in the concilium, Men and brethren, I am a Pharisaeus, the son of a Pharisaeus: of the spes and resurrectionem mortuorum I am judged.",
  "And when he had so said, there arose a dissensio between the Pharisaei and the Sadducaei: and the multitudo was divided.",
  "For the Sadducaei say that there is no resurrectio, neither angelus, nor spiritus: but the Pharisaei confess both.",
  "And there arose a great clamor: and the scribae of the Pharisaei rising up, strove, saying, We find no malum in this man: but if a spiritus or angelus hath spoken to him, let us not contra Deum.",
  "Now when there arose a great dissensio, the tribunus fearing lest Paul should be pulled in pieces by them, commanded the milites to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring him into the castra.",
  "And the night following the Dominus stood by him, and said, Be constant, Paul: for as thou hast testified of me in Ierusalem, so must thou also testify at Roma.",
  "And when it was day, certain Iudaei made a conspiratio, and bound themselves under an anathema, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.",
  "And they were more than forty, who had made this conspiratio.",
  "And they came to the principes of the sacerdotes, and the senioribus, and said, We have anathematized ourselves, that we will eat nothing until we have killed Paul.",
  "Now therefore ye with the concilium signify to the tribunus that he bring him down unto you, as though ye would inquire something more perfectly concerning him: and we, before he come near, are ready to kill him.",
  "And when Paul's nepos heard of the insidias, he went and entered into the castra, and told Paul.",
  "Then Paul called one of the centuriones unto him, and said, Bring this iuvenis unto the tribunus: for he hath something to signify unto him.",
  "So he took him, and brought him to the tribunus, and saith, Paul the captivus called me unto him, and prayed me to bring this iuvenis unto thee, who hath something to say unto thee.",
  "Then the tribunus took him by the manu, and went with him aside privately, and asked him, What is it that thou hast to signify unto me?",
  "And he said, The Iudaei have agreed to ask thee that thou wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the concilium, as though they would inquire somewhat of him more perfectly.",
  "But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, who have anathematized themselves, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now they are ready, looking for a promissio from thee.",
  "So the tribunus then dismissed the iuvenis, charging him to tell no man that he had signified unto him these things.",
  "And he called unto him two centuriones, saying, Make ready two centenas of milites to go to Caesarea, and horsemen threescore and ten, and two hundred lanciarii, at the third hora of the night;",
  "And provide them iumenta, that they may set Paul on, and bring him safe unto Felix the praeses.",
  "And he wrote a litteras after this manner:",
  "Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix sendeth greeting.",
  "This man was taken of the Iudaei, and should have been killed of them: then came I with the milites, and rescued him, having understood that he was a civis Romanus.",
  "And when I would have known the causa wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth into their concilium:",
  "Whom I perceived to be accused of quaestiones of their lex, but to have nothing worthy of morte or vinculis.",
  "And when it was told me how that the Iudaei laid wait for the man, I sent him to thee forthwith, and gave commandment to his accusers also to speak before thee.",
  "Farewell.",
  "Then the milites, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and brought him by night to Antipatris.",
  "On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castra:",
  "Who, when they came to Caesarea, and delivered the epistula to the praeses, presented Paul also before him.",
  "And when the praeses had read the letter, he asked of what provincia he was. And when he understood that he was of Cilicia;",
  "I will hear thee, said he, when thy accusers are also come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's praetorium."
