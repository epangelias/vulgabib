  "1 The word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying, 2 Arise, and go down to the potter's casa, and there I will causare thee my verbum.",
  "3 Then I went down to the potter's casa, and, behold, he wrought a work on the potter's tornus.",
  "4 And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the manus of the potter: so he made it again another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make it.",
  "5 Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying, 6 O house of Israel, cannot I do with you as this potter? saith the Lord. Behold, as the clay is in the potter's manus, so are ye in mine manus, O house of Israel.",
  "7 At what instant I shall speak concerning a gens, and concerning a regnum, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy it;",
  "8 If that gens, against whom I have pronounced, turn from their malum, I will repent of the malum that I thought to do unto them.",
  "9 And at what instant I shall speak concerning a gens, and concerning a regnum, to build and to plant it;",
  "10 If it do malum in my sight, that obey not my vocem, then I will repent of the bonum, wherewith I said I would beneficere unto it.",
  "11 Now therefore go to, speak to the homines of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I frame malum against you, and devise a consilium against you: return ye now every one from his malus via, and make your vias and your opera bonum.",
  "12 And they said, There is no spei: but we will walk after our own imaginari, and we will every one do the stubbornness of his evil cor.",
  "13 Therefore thus saith the Lord; Ask ye now among the gentes, Who hath heard such things? the virgin of Israel hath done a very horrible thing.",
  "14 Will a man leave the nix of the field, which is given him to drink, and go to be athirst to the montes, to seek wood and to cut it down?",
  "15 And shall a man make deos unto himself, and they are not dei? therefore, behold, they shall be as the scattered clouds, and the ventus shall carry them away.",
  "16 And the populus shall be confounded, and they shall say, What hath this deus given us? how hath he spoken unto us, and what bonum hath he done unto us?",
  "17 Every one had turned from his malus via, and every one from the imaginari of his evil cor, and had walked after other dei, to serve them, and to worship them: ye had not obeyed my vocem, saith the Lord;",
  "18 Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts, the Deus of Israel; Behold, I will feed them, even this populus, with fel and with amaritudinem.",
  "19 And I will scatter them among the gentes, whom neither they nor their patres have known: and I will send a gladius after them, till I have consumed them.",
  "20 Then shall the cities of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem go, and cry unto the dei, whom they have worshipped, but they shall not save them at all in the tempus of their tribulatio.",
  "21 For according to the numerus of thy cities were thy dei, O Judah; and according to the numerus of the streets of Jerusalem have ye set up altars to that scandalum, even altars to burn incensum unto Baal.",
  "22 Therefore thus saith the Lord; Behold, I will lay stumbling blocks before this populus, and the patres and the filii together shall fall upon them; the neighbor and his amicus shall perish.",
  "23 Thus saith the Lord; Behold, a populus cometh from the terra of the north, and a magnus gens shall rise from the sides of the terra.",
  "24 They shall lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no misericordia; their vox shall roar like the mari; and they shall ride upon horses, every one put in array, like a homo to the battalia, against thee, O filia of Zion.",
  "25 We have heard the fama of them, our manus wax feeble: anguish hath taken hold of us, and dolor, as of one in childbed.",
  "26 O filia of my populus, gird thee with sacco, lament and howl: for the spoiler shall suddenly come upon us.",
  "27 I have set thee for a probatio unto my populus, a fortitudo: and thou shalt know, and try their via.",
  "28 They are all rebellious and spearkers of calumnia; they are brass and iron: they are all corrupters.",
  "29 The ventus shall even sweep away the simulacrum, and the spoiler shall come upon them.",
  "30 For, behold, I will command, and I will sift the domus of Israel among all gentes, like as corn is sifted in a cribble; and the smallest grain shall not fall upon the terra.",
  "31 Behold, a tempest of the Lord shall go forth in my ira, a destroying tempest shall be poured out upon the caput of the wicked.",
  "32 Lo, evil shall go forth from natio to natio, and a magnus ventus shall be raised up from the coasts of the terra.",
  "33 And the slain of the Lord shall be at that die from one end of the terra even unto the other end of the terra: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the facies of the terra."
