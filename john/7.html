                    <p>After these things Jesus walked in Galilaea: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Iudaei sought to kill him.</p>
<p>Now the Iudaei feast of tabernacles was at hand.</p>
<p>His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Iudaea, that thy discipluli also may see the opera which thou doest.</p>
<p>For there is no man that doth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the mundo.</p>
<p>For neither did his brethren credit in him.</p>
<p>Then Jesus said unto them, My tempus is not yet come: but your tempus is alway ready.</p>
<p>The mundo cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testimonium perhibeo of it, that the opera thereof are mala.</p>
<p>Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast; for my tempus is not yet full come.</p>
<p>When he had said these words unto them, he abode still in Galilaea.</p>
<p>But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as in occulto.</p>
<p>Then the Iudaei sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?</p>
<p>And there was much murmuring among the multitudines concerning him: for some said, He is bonus: others said, Nay; but he seduceth the populum.</p>
<p>Howbeit no man spake openly of him for feare of the Iudaei.</p>
<p>Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the templum, and taught.</p>
<p>And the Iudaei marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man litteras, having never learned?</p>
<p>Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrina is not mine, but his that sent me.</p>
<p>If any man will do his voluntas, he shall know of the doctrina, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.</p>
<p>He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own gloria: but he that seeketh his gloria that sent him, the same is verax, and no iniquitas is in him.</p>
<p>Did not Moses give you the legem, and yet none of you keepeth the legem? Why go ye about to kill me?</p>
<p>The populus answered, and said, Thou hast a daemon, who goeth about to kill thee?</p>
<p>Jesus answered, and said unto them, I have done one opus, and ye all marvel.</p>
<p>Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision, (not because it is of Moses, but of the patres;) and ye on the sabbatum circumcidetis a man.</p>
<p>If a man on the sabbatum receiveth circumcision, that the legem of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man sane on the sabbatum?</p>
<p>Iudice not according to the species, but iudice righteous iudgement.</p>
<p>Then said some of them of Hierusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?</p>
<p>But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?</p>
<p>Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.</p>
<p>Then cried Jesus in the templum as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is verax, whom ye know not.</p>
<p>But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.</p>
<p>Then they sought to apprehend him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hora was not yet come.</p>
<p>And many of the populus believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more signa than these which Jesus hath done?</p>
<p>The Pharisaeei heard that the populus murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisaeei and the chief sacerdotes sent officers to take him.</p>
<p>Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto him that sent me.</p>
<p>Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come.</p>
<p>Then said the Iudaei among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersion among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?</p>
<p>What manner of saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come?</p>
<p>In the last day, that great day of the festum, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.</p>
<p>He that believeth on me, as the scriptura hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of aqua viva.</p>
<p>But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believed on him should receive: for the Holy Spirit was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorificatus.</p>
<p>Many of the populus therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Propheta.</p>
<p>Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilaea?</p>
<p>Hath not the scriptura said, That Christ cometh of the semen of David, and out of the civitas of Bethlehem, where David was?</p>
<p>So there was a dissensio among the populus about him.</p>
<p>And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.</p>
<p>Then came the ministri to the chief sacerdotes and Pharisaeei; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?</p>
<p>The ministri answered, Never man spake like this man.</p>
<p>Then answered them the Pharisaeei, Are ye also deceived?</p>
<p>Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisaeei believed on him?</p>
<p>But this populus which knoweth not the legem are cursed.</p>
<p>Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by noctem, being one of them,)</p>
<p>Doth our legem iudice any man, before it hear him, and know what he doth?</p>
<p>They answered, and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilaea? Search, and look: for out of Galilaea ariseth no Propheta.</p>
<p>And every man went unto his own domus.</p>
