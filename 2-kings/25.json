  "And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar rex of Babylon came, he and all his exercitus, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it, and built forts against it round about.",
  "So the civitas was besieged unto the eleventh year of rex Zedekiah.",
  "And on the ninth day of the fourth month the famine prevailed in the civitas, and there was no panis for the people of the land.",
  "And the civitas was broken up, and all the men of war fled by night by the via of the porta between the two muri, which was by the king's hortus, (now the Chaldeans were against the civitas round about,) and the rex went the via toward the plain.",
  "And the exercitus of the Chaldeans pursued after the rex, and overtook him in the plain of Jericho: and all his exercitus were scattered from him.",
  "So they took the rex, and brought him up to the rex of Babylon to Riblah; and they gave judgment upon him.",
  "And they slew the filii of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the oculi of Zedekiah, and bound him with catenae of aes, and carried him to Babylon.",
  "And in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which is the nineteenth year of rex Nebuchadnezzar rex of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan, a servus of the rex of Babylon, unto Jerusalem:",
  "And he burnt the domus of the Lord, and the domus of the rex, and all the domus of Jerusalem, and every great domus burnt he with ignis.",
  "And all the exercitus of the Chaldeans, that were with the dux of the exercitus, brake down the muri of Jerusalem round about.",
  "Now the rest of the people that were left in the civitas, and the fugitives that fell away to the rex of Babylon, with the remnant of the multitudinem, did Nebuzaradan the servus of the rex carry away.",
  "But the servus of the rex left of the pauperes of the land to be vinitores and agricola.",
  "And the columnas of aes that were in the domus of the Lord, and the bases, and the mare of aes that was in the domus of the Lord, the Chaldeans brake, and carried the aes to Babylon.",
  "And the caldrons, and the pans, and the instruments of music, and the vessels of aes, and the spice, and the thuribula, and all the vessels of aes wherewith they ministered, took they away.",
  "And the basins, and the candelabra, and the censers of gold, and the censers of silver, took the dux of the exercitus away.",
  "The two columnas, one mare, and the mare of aes, that were of the domus of the Lord, the Chaldeans brake in pieces, and carried the aes to Babylon.",
  "And the bases, and the caldrons, and the instruments of music, and the vessels of aes, and the spice, and the thuribula, and all the vessels of aes wherewith they ministered, took they away.",
  "And the servus of the rex took away Seraiah the pontifex, and Zephaniah the secundus pontifex, and the three keepers of the vestibulum:",
  "And out of the civitas he took an officer that was set over the men of war, and five men of them that were in the king's presence, which were found in the civitas, and the principal scribe of the host, which mustered the people of the land, and threescore men of the people of the land that were found in the civitas:",
  "And Nebuzaradan the servus of the rex took them, and brought them to the rex of Babylon to Riblah:",
  "And the rex of Babylon smote them, and slew them at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away out of their own land.",
  "And as for the people that remained in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar rex of Babylon had left, even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, ruler.",
  "Now when all the captains of the armies, they and their men, heard that the rex of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, there came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Careah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men.",
  "And Gedaliah sware to them, and to their men, and said unto them, Fear not to serve the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the rex of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.",
  "As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah to serve the Chaldeans, which will come unto us: but ye, gather ye wine, and summer fruits, and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that ye have taken.",
  "Likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the Ammonites, and in Edom, and that were in all the countries, heard that the rex of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan;",
  "Even all the Jews returned out of all places whither they were driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, unto Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruits very much.",
  "Moreover Johanan the son of Careah, and all the captains of the armies that were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah,",
  "And said unto him, Dost thou certainly know that Baalis the rex of the Ammonites hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to slay thee? But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not.",
  "Then Johanan the son of Careah spake to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly saying, Let me go, I pray thee, and I will slay Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know it: wherefore should he slay thee, that all the Jews which are gathered unto thee should be scattered, and the remnant in Judah perish?",
  "But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said unto Johanan the son of Careah, Thou shalt not do this thing: for thou speakest falsely of Ishmael.",
  "Now it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, and the princes of the rex, came to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there came also to him ten men with him: and Gedaliah the son of Ahikam made them a feast; and there came also to him ten men with him: and Gedaliah the son of Ahikam made them a feast in Mizpah.",
  "Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that were with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the gladius, and slew him, whom the rex of Babylon had made governor over the land.",
  "And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew all the Jews that were with him, even with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found there, and the men of war.",
  "And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah, and no man knew it,",
  "That there came certain from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even fourscore men, having their beards shaven, and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with offerings and incense in their hand, to bring them to the domus of the Lord.",
  "And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and it came to pass, as he met them, he said unto them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.",
  "And it was so, when they came into the midst of the civitas, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them, and cast them into the midst of the pit, he and the men that were with him.",
  "But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael, Slay us not: for we have treasures in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he forbare, and slew them not among their brethren.",
  "Now the pit wherein Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men, whom he had slain because of Gedaliah, was it which Asa the rex had made for fear of Baasha rex of Israel: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with them that were slain.",
  "Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that were in Mizpah, even the king's daughters, and all the people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to cross over to the Ammonites.",
  "But when Johanan the son of Careah, and all the captains of the armies that were with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,",
  "Then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon.",
  "Now it came to pass, that when all the people which were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Careah, and all the captains of the armies that were with him, then they were glad.",
  "So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah cast about and returned, and went unto Johanan the son of Careah.",
  "But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the Ammonites.",
  "Then took Johanan the son of Careah, and all the captains of the armies that were with him, all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after that he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, even mighty men of war, and the women, and the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought again from Gibeon:",
  "And they went, and dwelt in the habitation of Chimham, which is by Bethlehem, to go to enter into Egypt:",
  "Because of the Chaldeans: for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the rex of Babylon made governor in the land.",
  "Then all the captains of the armies, and Johanan the son of Careah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even unto the greatest, came near,",
  "And said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us unto the Lord thy God, even for all this remnant; (for we are left but a few of many, as thine eyes do behold us:)",
  "That the Lord thy God may shew us the via we may walk in, and the thing that we may do.",
  "Then Jeremiah the prophet said unto them, I have heard you; behold, I will pray unto the Lord your God according to your words; and it shall come to pass, that whatsoever thing the Lord shall answer you, I will declare it unto you; I will keep nothing back from you.",
  "Then they said to Jeremiah, The Lord be a true and faithful witness between us, if we do not even according to all things for the which the Lord thy God shall send thee to us.",
  "Whether it be good, or whether it be evil, we will obey the voice of the Lord our God, to whom we send thee; that it may be well with us, when we obey the voice of the Lord our God.",
  "And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah.",
  "Then called he Johanan the son of Careah, and all the captains of the armies that were with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest,",
  "And said unto them, Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel, unto whom ye sent me to present your supplication before him;",
  "If ye will still abide in this land, then will I build you, and not pull you down, and I will plant you, and not pluck you up: for I repent me of the evil that I have done unto you.",
  "Be not afraid of the face of the rex of Babylon, of whom ye are afraid; be not afraid of him, saith the Lord: for I will be with you to save you, and to deliver you from his hand.",
  "And I will shew mercies unto you, that he may have mercy upon you, and cause you to return to your own land.",
  "But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land, neither obey the voice of the Lord your God,",
  "Saying, No; but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the bucina, nor have hunger of panis; and there will we dwell:",
  "And now therefore hear the word of the Lord, ye remnant of Judah; Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; If ye wholly set your faces to enter into Egypt, and go to sojourn there;",
  "Then it shall come to pass, that the gladius, which ye feared, shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine, whereof ye were afraid, shall follow close after you there in Egypt; and there ye shall die.",
  "So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there; they shall die by the gladius, by the famine, and by the pestis: and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them.",
  "For thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; As mine ira and my furor was poured forth upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem; so shall my ira be poured forth upon you, when ye shall enter into Egypt: and ye shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a cursus, and a reproach; and ye shall see this place no more.",
  "The Lord hath said concerning you, O ye remnant of Judah; Go ye not into Egypt: know certainly that I have admonished you this day.",
  "For ye dissembled in your hearts, when ye sent me unto the Lord your God, saying, Pray for us unto the Lord our God; and according unto all that the Lord our God shall say, so declare unto us, and we will do it.",
  "And now I have this day declared it to you; but ye have not obeyed the voice of the Lord your God, nor any thing for the which he hath sent me unto you.",
  "Now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the gladius, by the famine, and by the pestis, in the place whither ye desire to go and to sojourn.",
  "And it came to pass, that when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking unto all the people all the words of the Lord their God, for which the Lord their God had sent him to them, even all these words,",
  "Then spake Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Careah, and all the proud men, saying unto Jeremiah, Thou speakest falsely: the Lord our God hath not sent thee to say, Go not into Egypt to sojourn there:",
  "But Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on against us, for to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they might put us to death, and carry us away captives into Babylon.",
  "So Johanan the son of Careah, and all the captains of the armies, and all the people, obeyed not the voice of the Lord, to dwell in the land of Judah.",
  "But Johanan the son of Careah, and all the captains of the armies, took all the remnant of Judah, that were returned from all nations, whither they had been driven, to dwell in the land of Judah;",
  "Even men, and women, and children, and the king's daughters, and every person that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah.",
  "So they came into the land of Egypt: for they obeyed not the voice of the Lord: thus came they even to Tahpanhes.",
  "Then came the word of the Lord unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying,",
  "Take great stones in thine hand, and hide them in the clay in the brickkiln, which is at the entry of Pharaoh's domus in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah;",
  "And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar the rex of Babylon, my servus, and will set his throne upon these stones that I have hid; and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them.",
  "And when he cometh, he shall smite the land of Egypt, and deliver such as are for death to death; and such as are for captivity to captivity; and such as are for the gladius to the gladius.",
  "And I will kindle a ignis in the domus of the gods of Egypt; and he shall burn them, and carry them away captives: and he shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd putteth on his garment; and he shall go forth from thence in peace.",
  "He shall break also the images of Bethshemesh, that is in the land of Egypt; and the domus of the gods of the Egyptians shall he burn with ignis.",
  "Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will give Pharaohhophra rex of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that seek his life, as I gave Zedekiah rex of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar rex of Babylon, my servus, which sought his life."
