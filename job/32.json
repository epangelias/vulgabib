  "So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.",
  "Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.",
  "Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.",
  "Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder than he.",
  "When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, then his wrath was kindled.",
  "And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am veritas, and this is my first dies to speak, and therefore I was timidae to shew you my scientia.",
  "I said, Days shall speak, and multitude of annus shall teach sapientia.",
  "But there is spiritus in man: and the inspiratio of the Omnipotens giveth them intellectus.",
  "It is not the magnus of age, that are sapiens, nor the seniores that understand iudicium.",
  "Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew my scientia.",
  "For I have waited for your verba, I have given ear to your rationes, whilst ye searched out what to say.",
  "Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you that reprehended Job, or that answered his verba:",
  "Lest ye should say, We have found scientia; God thrusteth him down, not man.",
  "Now he hath not directed his verba against me: neither will I answer him with your rationes.",
  "They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off to speak.",
  "When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, and answered no more;)",
  "I said, I will answer also my part, I also will shew my scientia.",
  "For I am full of verba, the spiritus of my belly constraineth me.",
  "Behold, my belly is as vinum which hath no cibus to break it, like a new orbe which hath not received the press.",
  "Let me not, I pray you, keep silent: for if I do, I shall burst like a new vinum bottle.",
  "Let me speak, that I may obtain refrigerium: let me open my lips, and answer.",
  "For I will not accept the person of man, nor will I give flattering titulos to man.",
  "For I know not to give flattering titulos; in so doing my Maker would soon take me away.",
  "Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my verba, and hearken to all my dicta.",
  "Behold, now I have opened my os, my lingua hath spoken in my os.",
  "My verba shall be of the simplicitas of my cor, and my labia shall utter scientia clearly.",
  "The spiritus of God hath made me, and the inspiratio of the Omnipotens hath given me vita.",
  "If thou canst answer me, set thy verba in order before me, stand up.",
  "Behold, I am according to thy wish in God's stead: I also am formed out of the limus.",
  "Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my manus be heavy upon thee.",
  "Surely thou hast spoken in mine aures, and I have heard the sonus of thy verba, saying,",
  "I am purus, without peccatum; I am innocent; neither is there iniquitas in me.",
  "Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his inimicus,",
  "He putteth my pedes in the neck collar, and watcheth all my vias; he carveth my steps.",
  "Behold, in this thou art not iustus, I will answer thee, that God is maior than man.",
  "Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his actiones.",
  "For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not.",
  "In somnus, in a visio of noctis, when somnus falleth upon men, and they are asleep in their lectus,",
  "Then he openeth the aures of men, and sealeth their instructio;",
  "That he may withdraw man from his actio, and hide pride from man.",
  "He keepeth back his anima from the fossa, and his vita from the gladius.",
  "He is chastised also with dolor on his lectus, and the multitude of his ossa is made to rot.",
  "His anima draweth near to the fossa, and his vita to the interficere.",
  "If there be an angelus over him, and an intercessor, one among a thousand, to shew unto man what is iustum for him;",
  "Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from descending to the fossa: I have found a cautionarium.",
  "His carne shall be fresher than a puer's: he shall return to the dies of his iuventus:",
  "He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his facies with iubilatio: for he rendereth unto man his iustitia.",
  "He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and perverted that which was iustum, and it profited me not;",
  "He will deliver his anima from the fossa, and his vita shall see the lumen.",
  "Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man,",
  "To bring back his anima from the fossa, that he may be enlightened with the lumen of the viventes."
