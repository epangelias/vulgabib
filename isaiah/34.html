                    <p>Come near, ye gentes, and hear; yea, heathen, hearken: and know that the terra is at thy command.</p>
<p>Who hath raised up one from the orient, whom he hath called in righteousness to his arm? He hath given the gentes before him, and made him ruler over reges.</p>
<p>At his presence the gentes are shaken, he shall scatter the insulae of the terra, and shall make the montes and the colles plain.</p>
<p>And the flumen shall be turned into crooked rivuli, and the pisciculi shall be dried up, because the flumen is dried up, and gone away.</p>
<p>And the beast of the campo shall honour him, the sirpentes, and the flying avis of the caelum; for he hath given them to esca, and nourishment to every carne.</p>
<p>They shall make war with thee, even from the tecta of the rocks, and of the hills; and with him shall make war from the montes of the terra.</p>
<p>His weapon shall be prepared to devour them with venenum: and all the impii shall be dissolved: yea, as wax melteth before the ignis.</p>
<p>And he shall consume with radice, and with folium, all the gentes.</p>
<p>And this is known unto all the inhabitantes of the terra, and the inhabitants of the mundo: for he is a fortis Deus, and not a mendax Deus.</p>
