                    <p>But it came to pass, that when Sanballat heard that we builded the murus, he was wroth, and took great indignation, and mocked the Jews.</p>
<p>And he spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, What do these Iudaei? shall they be let alone? will they offer sacrificia? will they make an end in a die?</p>
<p>Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that which they build, if a vulpes go up, he shall even break down their murus of stone.</p>
<p>Hear, O our Deus, for we are despised: turn their contempt into their own caput, and give them for a spoil in the terra of captivitas:</p>
<p>And cover not their iniquitas, and let not their peccatum be blotted out from before thee: for they have provoked thee to anger before the builders.</p>
<p>So built we the murus; and all the murus was joined together unto the half thereof: for the people had a voluntas to work.</p>
<p>But it came to pass, that when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabes, and the Ammonites, and the Azotii heard that the walls of Ierusalem were made up, and that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth;</p>
<p>And conspired all of them together to come and to fight against Ierusalem, and to hinder it.</p>
<p>Nevertheless we made our prayer unto our Deus, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them.</p>
<p>And Iudaea said, The strength of the porters decayeth, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to build.</p>
<p>And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till we come in the midst among them, and slay them, and cause the work to cease.</p>
<p>And it came to pass, that when the Jews which dwelt by them came, they said unto us ten times, From all places whence ye shall return unto us they will be upon you.</p>
<p>Therefore set I in the lower places behind the murus, and on the rivers, I even set the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their arcus.</p>
<p>And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of them: remember the Deus great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your filii, your uxor, and your houses.</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known unto us, and Deus had brought their counsel to nought, that we returned all of us to the murus, every one unto his work.</p>
<p>And it came to pass from that time forth, that the half of my servants wrought in the work, and the other half of them held both the lancea, and the clypeus, and the arcus, and the corset, and the rulers were behind all the house of Iudaea.</p>
<p>They which builded on the murus, and they that bare burdens, with those that laded, every one with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the other hand held a clypeus.</p>
<p>For the builders, every one had his gladius girt by his side, and so builded. And he that sounded the bucina was by me.</p>
<p>And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, The work is great and large, and we are separated upon the murus, one far from another:</p>
<p>In what place therefore ye hear the sound of the bucina, resort ye thither unto us: our Deus shall fight for us.</p>
<p>So we wrought in the work: and half of them held the lancea, and the clypeus, and the arcus, and the corset, from the rising of the sol, until the stars appeared.</p>
<p>Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every one with his servus lodge within Ierusalem, that they may be a watch for us in the nocte.</p>
<p>So there was I and my brethren, and my servus, they that followed me, we did not put off our vestes, saving every one put them off for washing.</p>
