                    <p>1 The words of Amos, who was among the herdmen of Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel, two years before the terraemotus.</p>
<p>2 And he said, The Dominus will roar from Zion, and utter his vox from Jerusalem; and the habitacula of the pastores shall mourn, and the vertex of Carmel shall wither.</p>
<p>3 Thus saith the Dominus; For three transgressiones of Damascus, and for four, I will not convert it, because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of ferrum.</p>
<p>4 But I will send a ignis into the domus of Hazael, which shall devour the palatia of Benhadad.</p>
<p>5 I will break also the barra of Damascus, and cut off the habitantem out of the valle of Aven, and him that holdeth the scepter out of the domus of Eden: and the people of Syria shall be carried away into captivity to Kir, saith the Dominus.</p>
<p>6 Thus saith the Dominus; For three transgressiones of Gaza, and for four, I will not convert it, because they carried away captive the whole captivity, to deliver them up to Edom:</p>
<p>7 But I will send a ignis on the wall of Gaza, which shall devour the palatia thereof:</p>
<p>8 And I will cut off the habitantem from Ashdod, and him that holdeth the scepter from Ashkelon, and I will turn mine hand against Ekron: and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish, saith the Dominus Deus.</p>
<p>9 Thus saith the Dominus; For three transgressiones of Tyrus, and for four, I will not convert it, because they delivered up the whole captivity to Edom, and remembered not the foedus of fratres:</p>
<p>10 But I will send a ignis on the wall of Tyrus, which shall devour the palatia thereof.</p>
<p>11 Thus saith the Dominus; For three transgressiones of Edom, and for four, I will not convert it, because he did pursue his frater with gladius, and did cast off all pitie, and his ira did tear perpetually, and he kept his indignation for ever:</p>
<p>12 But I will send a ignis upon Teman, which shall devour the palatia of Bozrah.</p>
<p>13 Thus saith the Dominus; For three transgressiones of the filii Ammon, and for four, I will not convert it, because they have ripped up the mulieres with child of Gilead, that they might enlarge their terminus:</p>
<p>14 But I will kindle a ignis in the wall of Rabbah, and it shall devour the palatia thereof, with clamor in the die of proelium, with tempest in the die of ventus.</p>
<p>15 And their king shall go into captivity, he and his principes together, saith the Dominus.</p>
