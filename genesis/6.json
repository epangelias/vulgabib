  "And it came to pass, when homines began to multiplicare on the terra, and filii of God saw the filiae of homines, that they were pulchrae: they took them wives of all which they chose.",
  "And the Dominus said, My spiritus shall not always contend with homo, for that he also is caro: yet his dies shall be centum viginti annos.",
  "There were gigantes in the terra in those dies; and also after that, when the filii of God came in unto the filiae of homines, and they bare filii to them, the same became potentes of the terra, qui were of old, hommes of fama.",
  "And the Dominus saw that the malitia of homo was multa upon the terra, and that every imaginatio of the thoughts of his cor was only malum continually.",
  "And it repented the Dominus that he had made homo on the terra, and it grieved him at cor.",
  "And the Dominus said, I will destroy homo whom I have created from the superficies of the terra; both homo, and beast, and the reptilia, and the fowl of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.",
  "But Noe found gratia in the oculi of the Dominus.",
  "These are the generations of Noe: Noe was a iustus homo and perfectus in his generations, and Noe walked with Deo.",
  "And Noe begat tres filii, Sem, Cham, and Japheth.",
  "The terra also was corrupta before Deo; and the terra was repleta with violentia.",
  "And Deo saw the terra, that it was corrupta; for all caro had corrupted his via upon the terra.",
  "And Deo said unto Noe, The finis of all caro is come before me; for the terra is repleta with violentia through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the terra.",
  "Make thee an arca of lignum of gopher; roomes shalt thou make in the arca, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.",
  "And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the arca shall be trecentos cubits, the breadth of it quinquaginta cubits, and the altitude of it triginta cubits.",
  "A fenestra shalt thou make to the arca, and in one cubito shalt thou finish it above; and the ostium of the arca shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, secundus, and tertius stories shalt thou make it.",
  "And, behold, I, even I, do bring a diluvium of aqua upon the terra, to destroy all caro, wherein is the spiritus of vita, from under caelum; and every thing that is in the terra shall perish.",
  "But with thee will I establish my foedus; and thou shalt enter into the arca, thou, and filii tui, and uxor tua, and filiae tuae with thee.",
  "And of every bestia, and of every reptile, and of every avis of the air, shalt thou take to thee by septenos, the male and the female, to keep semina vivum upon the superficies of the terra.",
  "For yet septem dies, and I will send pluviam upon the terra xl dies and xl noctes; and every substance that I have made will I destroy from the superficies of the terra.",
  "And Noe did according unto all that the Dominus commanded him.",
  "And Noe was quingentorum annos old: and Noe entered into the arca, he and filii tui, and uxor tua, and filiae tuae with him, because of the aqua of the diluvium."
