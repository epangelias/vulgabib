  "And Samson went to Gaza, and saw there an harlot, and went in unto her, and it came to pass after this, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah, and the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said unto her, Entice him, and see wherein his great fortitudo lies, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him: and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces of argentum.",
  "And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great fortitudo lies, and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee, and Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green cords that were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.",
  "Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green cords which had not been dried, and she bound him with them, and Now there were men lying in wait, abscconditi in the chamber, and she said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he brake the cords, as a filum of tow is broken when it toucheth the ignis: so his fortitudo was not known.",
  "And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound, and Samson said unto her, If they bind me fast with two new cords that never were occupied, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.",
  "Delilah therefore took two new cords, and bound him therewith, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And there were liers in wait abscconditi in the chamber. And he brake them from off his arms like a filum.",
  "And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound. And he said unto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web, and fastenest it with the pin, then I shall be weak, and be as another man.",
  "And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his fortitudo went from him.",
  "And she said, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times before, and shake myself. And he wist not that the Lord was departed from him.",
  "But the Philistines took him, and put out his oculi, and brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of aer: and he did grind in the prison house.",
  "Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaved.",
  "Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their deus, and to rejoice: for they said, Our deus hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.",
  "And when the people saw him, they praised their deus: for they said, Our deus hath delivered into our hands our enemy, and the destroyer of our terra, which slew many of us.",
  "And it came to pass, as soon as they had made an end of offering the sacrifice, that they brought Samson forth out of the prison house, that he might make them sport: and they set him between the columns.",
  "And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me that I may feel the columns whereupon the domus standeth, that I may lean upon them.",
  "Now the domus was full of men and women; and there were all the lords of the Philistines; and there were upon the roof about three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport.",
  "And Samson called unto the Lord, and said, O Lord God, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two oculi.",
  "And Samson took hold of the two middle columns upon which the domus stood, and on which it was borne up, of the one with his right hand, and of the other with his left.",
  "And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed himself with all his might; and the domus fell upon the lords, and upon all the people that were therein. So the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his vita.",
  "Then his brethren and all the domus of his pater came down, and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the sepulchre of Manoah his pater. And he judged Israel twenty years."
