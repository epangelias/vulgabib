  "Then said the Lord unto me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of her friend, and an adulteress, according to the love of the Lord toward the filii Israel, who look to other deos, and love flagitia, and grapes.",
  "So I bought her to me for quindecim pieces of argentum, and for an homer of hordeum, and an half homer of hordeum.",
  "And I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many dies; thou shalt not be meretrix, thou shalt not be uxor to any other homo.",
  "For the filii Israel shall abide many dies without rex, and without prince, and without sacrificium, and without ephod, and without teraphim:",
  "Afterward shall the filii Israel return, and seek the Lord their Deus, and David their rex; and shall fear the Lord and his bonitas in the novissimum dies."
