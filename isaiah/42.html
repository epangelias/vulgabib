                    <p>Behold my servus, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my animus delighteth; I have put my Spiritus upon him: he shall bring forth iudicium to the Gentiles.</p>
<p>He shall not clamare, nor lift up, nor cause his vox to be heard in the plateae.</p>
<p>A bruised reed shall he not contrivare, and the smoking flax shall he not extinguere: he shall bring forth iudicium unto veritas.</p>
<p>He shall not faillere, nor be discussum, till he have set iudicium in terra: and the isles shall wait for his legem.</p>
<p>Thus saith Deus the Lord, he that createth the caelum, and stretcheth it out; he that spreadeth abroad the terram, and the things that procedunt out of it; he that giveth animam to the populus upon it, and spiritum to them that walk upon it:</p>
<p>I the Lord have called thee in iustitia, and will hold thine manus, and will keep thee, and give thee for a foedus of the populus, for a lumen of the Gentiles;</p>
<p>To open the oculos that are caeci, to bring out the vinculis, and from the domus of prison those that sit in tenebris.</p>
<p>I am the Lord: that is my nomen: and my gloriam will I not give to another, neither my laudem to graven imagines.</p>
<p>Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do I declare: before they spring forth I tell you of them.</p>
<p>Sing unto the Lord a novum canticum, and his laudem from the end of the terra, ye that go down to the mare, and all that is therein, the isles and the inhabitants thereof.</p>
<p>Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their vox, the villages that Kedar doth inhabit: let the inhabitants of the petra sing, let them shout from the top of the montes.</p>
<p>Let them give gloriam unto the Lord, and declare his laudem in the insulas.</p>
<p>The Lord shall go forth as a fortis, he shall stir up zelus like a miles: he shall cry, yea, roar; he shall prevail against his inimici.</p>
<p>I have long time holden my pacem; I have been still, and refrained myself: now will I cry like a parturient, I will destroy and devour at once.</p>
<p>I will make waste montes and hills, and dry up all their herba: and I will make the flumina islands, and I will dry up the stagna.</p>
<p>And I will bring the caeci by a way that they knew not; I will lead them in semitis that they have not known: I will make tenebrae light before them, and crooked things straight. These things will I do unto them, and not forsake them.</p>
<p>They shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed, that trust in graven imagines, that say to the molten imagines, Ye are our dei:</p>
<p>Hear, ye that are caeci, and look, ye that are sordidi, that ye may see.</p>
<p>Who is sordid, but my servus? or caecus, as my angel whom I sent? or caecus as he that is perfectus in viis my dei?</p>
<p>Seeing many things, but thou observest not; opening the aures, but he heareth not.</p>
<p>The Lord is well pleased for his iustitia' sake; he will magnify the legem, and make it honorable.</p>
<p>But this is a populus spoiled and robbed; they are all of them in fossa, and they are hid in munitiones: they are for a praeda, and none delivereth; for a spolium, and none saith, Restore.</p>
<p>Who among you will give ear to this? who will hearken and hear for the tempus to come?</p>
<p>Who gave Iacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robatores? was it not the Lord, he against whom we have peccatum? for they would not walk in his viis, neither were they obediens to his legem.</p>
<p>Therefore he hath poured upon him the furor of his ira, and the robigo of warfare: it hath set him on fire round about, yet he knew not; and it burned him, yet he laqueus not in corde.</p>
<p>But now thus saith the Lord that created thee, O Iacob, and he that formed thee, O Israel, Fear not: for I have redemptus thee, I have called thee by thy nomine; thou art meus.</p>
<p>When thou passest through the aquas, I will be with thee; and through the flumina, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the ignem, thou shalt not be combustionis, neither shall the flamma kindle upon thee.</p>
<p>For I am the Lord thy Deus, the Sanctus of Israel, thy Salvator: I gave Egypt for thy redemptio, Ethiopia and Seba for thee.</p>
<p>Since thou wast precious in my oculus, thou hast been honorabilis, and I have loved thee: therefore will I give homines for thee, and peoples for thy vita.</p>
<p>Fear not: for I am with thee: I will bring thy semen from the Orient, and from the Occident I will gather thee.</p>
<p>I will say to the Aquilon, Give up; and to the Austrum, Keep not back: bring my filios from far, and my filias from the end of terra;</p>
<p>Even every one that calleth on the nomine of the Lord shall be salvus.</p>
