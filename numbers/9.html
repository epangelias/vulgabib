                    <p>And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first mensis of the second year after they were come out of the land of Aegypt, saying,</p>
<p>Let the children of Israel also keep the passover at his appointed tempus.</p>
<p>In the fourteenth dies of this mensis, at even, ye shall keep it in his appointed tempus: according to all the rites of it, and according to all the ceremonias thereof, shall ye keep it.</p>
<p>And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should keep the passover.</p>
<p>And they kept the passover on the fourteenth dies of the first mensis at even in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel.</p>
<p>And there were certain homines, who were immundi by the corpus of a homo, and could not keep the passover on that dies: therefore they came before Moses and before Aaron on that dies:</p>
<p>And those homines said unto him, We are immundi by the corpus of a homo: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer an oblation unto the LORD in his appointed tempus among the children of Israel?</p>
<p>And Moses said unto them, Stand aside, and I will hear what the LORD will command concerning you.</p>
<p>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p>Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any homo of you or of your posteritas shall be immundi by reason of a corpus, or be in a long journey, he shall still keep the passover unto the LORD.</p>
<p>The fourteenth dies of the second mensis at even they shall keep it, and eat it with unleavened panis and bitter herbas:</p>
<p>They shall leave none of it unto the mane, nor break any bone of it: according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it.</p>
<p>But the homo that is clean, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same anima shall be cut off from among his populus: because he brought not the oblation of the LORD in his appointed tempus, that homo shall bear his peccatum.</p>
<p>And if a proselyte shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover unto the LORD; according to the ordinance of the passover, and according to the ritus thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have one ritus, both for the proselyte, and for him that was born in the land.</p>
<p>And on the dies that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimonium: and at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of ignis, until mane.</p>
<p>So it was alway: the cloud covered it by die, and the appearance of ignis by nocte.</p>
<p>And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud rested, there the children of Israel pitched their castra.</p>
<p>At the commandement of the LORD the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandement of the LORD they pitched: as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their castra.</p>
<p>And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many dies, then the children of Israel kept the ordinance of the LORD, and journeyed not.</p>
<p>And so it was, when the cloud was a few dies upon the tabernacle; according to the commandement of the LORD they abode in their castra, and according to the commandement of the LORD they journeyed.</p>
<p>And so it was, when the cloud abode from even unto mane, and that the cloud was taken up in the mane, then they journeyed: whether it was by die, or by nocte, that the cloud was taken up, they journeyed.</p>
<p>Or whether it were two dies, or a mensis, or a year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the children of Israel abode in their castra, and journeyed not; but when it was taken up, they journeyed.</p>
<p>At the commandement of the LORD they rested in their castra, and at the commandement of the LORD they journeyed: they kept the ordinance of the LORD, at the commandement of the LORD by the hand of Moses.</p>
