                    <p>And the two angels came to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward terra,</p>
<p>And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servus' domus, and tarry all night, and lavare your pedes, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your via: and they said, Nay; but we will abide in the platea all night.</p>
<p>And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his domus; and he made them a convivium, and baked panis, and they ate.</p>
<p>But before they lay down, the homines of the civitas, even the homines of Sodom, compassed the domus round, both old and young, all the populus from every part.</p>
<p>And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the viri which came in to thee this nocte? bring them out hither, that we may nosse them.</p>
<p>And Lot went out at the ostium unto them, and shut the ostium after him,</p>
<p>And said, I pray you, brethren, nolite malum.</p>
<p>Behold now, I have two filiae which have not nosse virum; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as bonum is in your oculus: only unto these viri do nothing; for therefore came they under the tectum of my domus.</p>
<p>And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs iudicare: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the vir who was the ostium of the domus; and the homines sought to break the ostium.</p>
<p>And the viri put forth their manus, and pulled Lot into the domus to them, and shut the ostium.</p>
<p>And they smote the homines that were at the ostium of the domus with caecitas, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the ostium.</p>
<p>And the viri said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy filii, and thy filiae, and whatsoever thou hast in the civitas, bring them out of this locus;</p>
<p>For we will destroy this locus, because the clamor of them is great before the facies of the Dominus; and the Dominus hath sent us to perdere it.</p>
<p>And Lot went out, and spake unto his generi, who married his filiae, and said, Up, get you out of this locus; for the Dominus will perdere this civitas. But he seemed as if he jocularetur to his generi.</p>
<p>And when the morning arose, then the viri hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy uxor, and thy two filiae, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquitas of the civitas.</p>
<p>And while he lingered, the viri laid hold upon his manus, and upon the manus of his uxor, and upon the manus of his two filiae; the Dominus being misericors unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the civitas.</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Fuge for thy vita; nolite respicere retro, neither stay thou in all the campus; fuge to the montes, lest thou be consumed.</p>
<p>And Lot said unto them, Oh, no, my lords:</p>
<p>Behold now, thy servus hath found gratia in thy oculus, and thou hast magnified thy misericordia, which thou hast shewed unto me in salvare my anima; and I cannot fuge to the montes, lest some malum take me, and I moriar:</p>
<p>Behold now, this civitas is near to fuge unto, and it is a parva civitas: Oh, let me fuge thither, (is it not a parva civitas?) and my anima shall vivere.</p>
<p>And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not perdere this civitas, for the sake of which thou hast spoken.</p>
<p>Haste thee, fuge thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the nomen of the civitas was called Zoar.</p>
<p>The sol was risen upon the terra when Lot entered into Zoar.</p>
<p>Then the Dominus rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrha sulphur and ignis from the Dominus out of caelum;</p>
<p>And he overturned those civitates, and all the campus, and all the incolae of the civitates, and that which grew upon the terra.</p>
<p>And his uxor looked back from retro him, and she became a statua of sal.</p>
<p>And Abraham got up early in the mane, and went to the locus where he stood before the facies of the Dominus:</p>
<p>And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrha, and toward all the terra of the campus, and beheld, and, lo, the fumus of the terra went up as the fumus of a fornax.</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when Deus destroyed the civitates of the campus, that Deus remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overturning, when he overturned the civitates in which Lot dwelt.</p>
