                    <p>And Abram went up out of Egypt, he and his uxorem and all that he had, and he went to the land of Canaan unto the place, ubi his tent was before at the valley of Mamre which is at Hebron: the site where he had genium sacrificed.</p>
<p>Then Abram took Sara, his sponsam and went forth by night for an inn so as not to fear persecution; ubi lot quivered exceedingly his mouth dry  till behold of in a moment he the voice of an angel thus saying: 'Fear not Abram for I am your scutum, thy reward shall be exceeding great.</p>
<p>And he built there an arca unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord, qui apparuit ei, saying: 'Unto thy semen and to the semen of thy semen will I give this land' and there he erected an arca and called upon the name of the Lord.</p>
<p>And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the meridiem, and the land was strait for them, so that they could not dwell together.</p>
