                    <p>Then came near the heads of the fathers of the Levites unto Eleazar the sacerdos and unto Joshua filius Nun, and unto the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the filii Israel;</p>
<p>And they spake unto them at Shiloh in the terra of Canaan, saying, The Lord commanded by the hand of Moses to give us civitates to dwell in, with the suburbia for our cattle.</p>
<p>And the filii Israel gave unto the Levites out of their hereditas, according to the word of the Lord, these civitates and their suburbia.</p>
<p>And the lot came out for the familia of Kohath: and the filii Aaron the sacerdos, which were of the Levites, had by lot out of the tribus of Judah, and out of the tribus of Simeon, and out of the tribus of Benjamin, thirteen civitates.</p>
<p>And the rest of the filii Kohath had by lot out of the familia of the tribus, out of the half tribus of Manasseh, ten civitates.</p>
<p>And the filii Gershon had by lot out of the familia of the tribus of Issachar, and out of the tribus of Asher, and out of the tribus of Naphtali, and out of the half tribus of Manasseh in Bashan, thirteen civitates.</p>
<p>The filii Merari by their familia had out of the tribus of Reuben, and out of the tribus of Gad, and out of the tribus of Zebulun, twelve civitates.</p>
<p>And the filii Israel gave unto the Levites these civitates with their suburbia, as the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses, in giving them by lot.</p>
<p>Thus they gave out of the tribus of the filii Judah, and out of the tribus of the filii Simeon, these civitates which are here mentioned by name.</p>
<p>Which the filii Aaron, being of the familia of the Kohathites, who were of the filii Levi, had: for theirs was the first lot.</p>
<p>And they gave them the civitas Arba of the pater of Anak, which is Hebron, in the montes of Judah, with the suburbia round about it.</p>
<p>But the fields of the civitas, and the villae thereof, gave they to Caleb filius Jephunneh for his possessio.</p>
<p>Thus they gave to the filii Aaron the sacerdos Hebron with her suburbia, to be a civitas of refuge for the homicide, and Libnah with her suburbia,</p>
<p>And Jattir with her suburbia, and Eshtemoa with her suburbia,</p>
<p>And Holon with her suburbia, and Debir with her suburbia,</p>
<p>And Ain with her suburbia, and Juttah with her suburbia, and Bethshemesh with her suburbia; nine civitates out of those two tribes.</p>
<p>And out of the tribus of Benjamin, Gibeon with her suburbia, and Geba with her suburbia,</p>
<p>Anathoth with her suburbia, and Almon with her suburbia; four civitates.</p>
<p>All the civitates of the filii Aaron, the sacerdotes, were thirteen civitates with their suburbia.</p>
<p>And the rest of the filii Kohath had by lot out of the familia of the tribus of Ephraim, and out of the tribus of Dan, and out of the half tribus of Manasseh, ten civitates.</p>
<p>And the filii Gershon had by lot out of the familia of the tribus of Issachar, and out of the tribus of Asher, and out of the tribus of Naphtali, and out of the half tribus of Manasseh in Bashan, thirteen civitates.</p>
<p>The filii Merari by their familia had twelve civitates out of the tribus of Reuben, and out of the tribus of Gad, and out of the tribus of Zebulun.</p>
<p>Thus the filii Israel gave to the Levites these civitates with their suburbia.</p>
<p>And they gave by lot out of the tribus of the filii Judah, and out of the tribus of the filii Simeon, and out of the tribus of Benjamin, these civitates, which are called by their names.</p>
<p>And the suburbia of some of the civitates of the filii of Judah fell to the filii Benjamin.</p>
<p>The second lot came forth to Simeon, even for the tribus of the filii Simeon of the hereditas of the filii Judah.</p>
<p>Their hereditas was toward the south, and the uttermost parts thereof were toward the south.</p>
<p>And it went out to the south side to Maalehacrabbim, and passed along to Zin, and ascended up on the south side unto Kadeshbarnea, and passed along to Hezron, and went up to Adar, and fetched a compass to Karkaa:</p>
<p>From thence it passed toward Azmon, and went out unto the river of Egypt; and the goings out of that coast were at the sea: this shall be your south coast.</p>

<p>And the border went up toward Debir from the valley of Achor, and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that is before the going up to Adummim, which is on the south side of the river: and the border passed toward the waters of Enshemesh, and the goings out thereof were at Enrogel:</p>
<p>And the border went up by the valley of the filii of Hinnom unto the south side of the Jebusite; the same is Jerusalem: and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lieth before the valley of Hinnom westward, which is by the valley of the giants northward:</p>
<p>And the border was from the top of the mountain unto the fountain of the water of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities of mount Ephron; and the border was to Baalah, which is Kirjathjearim:</p>
<p>And the border compassed from Baalah westward unto mount Seir, and passed along unto the side of mount Jearim, which is Chesalon, on the north side, and went down to Bethshemesh, and passed on to Timnah:</p>
<p>And the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward: and the border was drawn to Shicron, and passed along to mount Baalah, and went out unto Jabneel; and the goings out of the border were at the sea.</p>
<p>And the west coast was to the great sea, and the coast thereof. This is the coast of the filii of Judah round about according to their families.</p>
<p>And unto Caleb the filius of Jephunneh he gave a part among the filii of Judah, according to the commandment of the Lord to Joshua, even the city of Arba of the pater of Anak, which city is Hebron.</p>
<p>And Caleb drove thence the three filii of Anak, Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, the filii of Anak.</p>
<p>And he went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher.</p>
<p>And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my filia to wife.</p>
<p>And Othniel the filius of Kenaz, the frater of Caleb, took it: and he gave him Achsah his filia to wife.</p>
<p>And it came to pass, as she came unto him, that she moved him to ask of her pater a field: and she lighted off her ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wouldest thou?</p>
<p>Who answered, Give me a blessing; for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And he gave her the upper springs, and the nether springs.</p>
<p>This is the hereditas of the tribus of the filii of Judah according to their families.</p>

<p>And they went from Geba to Michmash eastward, then northward, and went to Geba of the valley, and the coast of Ittahkazin, and so went to the well of the waters of Nephtoah:</p>
<p>And the border went from the top of the mountain unto the fountain of the water of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities of mount Ephron; and the border was to Baalah, which is Kirjathjearim:</p>

<p>Out of the part of the filii of Judah was the hereditas of the filii of Simeon: for the part of the filii of Judah was too much for them: therefore the filii of Simeon had their hereditas within the hereditas of them.</p>
<p>And the third lot came up for the filii of Zebulun according to their families: and the border of their hereditas was unto Sarid:</p>
<p>And their border went up toward the sea, and Maralah, and reached to Dabbasheth, and reached to the river that is before Jokneam;</p>

<p>And then the border turneth to Ramah, and to the strong city Tyre; and the border turneth to Hosah; and the outgoings thereof are at the sea from the coast to Achzib:</p>

<p>This is the hereditas of the tribus of the filii of Dan according to their families, these cities with their villae.</p>
<p>So they made an end of dividing the terra for hereditas by their coasts; and the filii of Israel gave an hereditas to Joshua the filius of Nun among them:</p>
<p>According to the word of the Lord they gave him the city which he asked, even Timnathserah in mount Ephraim: and he built the city, and dwelt therein.</p>
<p>These are the hereditates, which Eleazar the sacerdos, and Joshua the filius of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of the filii Israel, divided for an hereditas by lot in Shiloh before the Lord, at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. So they made an end of dividing the terra.</p>
