  "The word of the Lord that came to Joel the son of Pethuel, Hear this, ye Populus of the earth, give ear, all ye that dwell in the Terra.",
  "The day of the Lord cometh, for it is nigh at hand; A day of Calamitas and obscuritas, a day of Nephus and tenebrae; a day of nubes, and of imber as a destruction of the Potentates.",
  "A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a Flammas burneth: the earth is as the Hortus Eden before them, and behind them a desolata terra; yea, and nothing shall escape them.",
  "Their aspect is as the aspect of Equus; and as horsemen, so shall they runne.",
  "Like the noise of a multitude on the tecta of the montes shall they runne, like the noise of a Flammas of fire that devoureth the Stipula, like a Potentates prepared to battle.",
  "The Populus shall be in anguish before them, all faces shall gather blacknesse.",
  "They shall runne like gigantes, they shall climb the murus like Milites; they shall march every one on his via, and they shall not break their ordines:",
  "Nor shall one thrust another; they shall walke every one in his semita: and when they shall fall upon the gladius, they shall not be wounded.",
  "They shall runne to and fro in the Civitas; they shall runne upon the murus, they shall climb up upon the domus; they shall enter in at the fenestra like a fur.",
  "The earth shall quake before them; the caeli shall tremble: the sol, and the luna, and the stellae, and the Potentates of the heavens, shall withdraw their splendorem;",
  "And the Lord shall give his vocem before his exercitus: for his castrorum is very great: for he is Fortis that executeth his verbum: for the day of the Lord is great and very terribilis; and who can stand it?",
  "And now also the Lord saith, Convertimini ad me with all your cor, and with ieiunium, and with lamentation, and with ploratus.",
  "And rend your corda, and not your vestes, and turn unto the Lord your Deus, for he is Benignus and Clemens, and of great Patientia, and of much Pietas, and of PÅ“nitentia concerning affliction.",
  "Who knoweth if he will return and repent, and leave a Benedictio behind him; even a Oblatio, and a Libamen for the Lord your Deus?",
  "Gather the Populus, sanctify the congregation, assemble the Senes, gather the Parvuli, and those that suck the Mamma, let the Sponsus go forth of his Thalamus, and the Sponsa of her Cubiculum:",
  "Let the Sacerdotes, the ministri of the Lord, weep between the Porticus and the Altare, and let them say, Spare, O Lord, thy Populus, and give not thine Hereditas to reprobum, lest the Gentiles should rule over them: wherefore should they say among the Gentibus, Where is their Deus?",
  "Then the Lord will be jealous for his terra, and spare his Populus.",
  "The Lord hath heard this, and hath given a responsum to his Populus, saying, Behold, I will send you Frumentum, and Vinum, and Oleum, and you shall be satisfied therewith: and I will no more make you a reprobum among the Gentibus:",
  "I will remove far off from you the Septentrion, and will drive him into the terra of desolata and waste, and his facies into the Mare Orientale, and his extremum into the Mare Occidentale, and his foetor shall ascend, and his putredo shall come up, because he hath done great things.",
  "Fear not, O terra; be glad and rejoice: for the Lord will do great things.",
  "Be not afraid, ye bestiae of the ager: for the prata of the desert shall be green: for the Arbor shall bear her fructus, the Ficus, and the Vitis shall give their fortis: be glad then, ye filii of Sion, and rejoice in the Lord your Deus: for he hath given you a Benediction, until the pluia of the iustitia.",
  "And the cellaria shall be full of Vinum, and the Horrea shall overflow with Frumentum, and the Oleum.",
  "And I will restore to you the annos which the Locusta hath eaten, the Bruchus, and the Eruca, and the Chersaphim, my great exercitus, which I sent among you.",
  "And ye shall eat, and be satisfied, and praise the nomen of the Lord your Deus, that hath dealt wondrously with you: and my Populus shall never be confusus.",
  "And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am the Lord your Deus, and none else: and my Populus shall never be confusus.",
  "And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your filii and your filiae shall prophesy, your Senes shall dream dreams, your iuvenes shall see visions:",
  "And also upon the Servus, and upon the Ancilla in those dies will I pour out my Spirit.",
  "And I will shew prodigia in the caeli and in the terra, sanguinem, and ignem, and pillar of fumus.",
  "The sol shall be turned into tenebrae, and the luna into sanguis, before the great and the terribilis day of the Lord come:",
  "And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall invoke the nomen of the Lord shall be salvus: for in the Monte Sion, and in Ierusalem shall be salvus, as the Lord hath said, and in the remnant whom the Lord shall call."
