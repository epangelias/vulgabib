                    <p>1 If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and giveth thee a signe or a miraculum, and the signe or the miraculum come to pass, wherof he spake unto thee, saying, Let us goe after other deitates, which thou hast not knowne, and let us serve them;</p>
<p>2 Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams: for the Dominus your Deus proveth you, to know whether ye love the Dominus your Deus with all your heart and with all your soul.</p>
<p>3 Ye shall walke after the Dominus your Deus, and feare him, and keepe his Commandamenta, and obey his voyce, and ye shall serve him, and cleave unto him.</p>
<p>4 And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death; because he hath spoken to turne you away from the Dominus your Deus, which brought you out of the land of Aegyptus, and redeemed you out of the house of servitudo, to thrust thee out of the way which the Dominus thy Deus commanded thee to walke in. So shalt thou put the evil away from the midst of thee.</p>
<p>5 If thy brother, the sonne of thy mother, or thy sonne, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which is as thine own soul, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us goe and serve other deitates, which thou hast not knowne, thou nor thy fathers;</p>
<p>6 Namely, of the deitates of the people which are round about you, nigh unto thee, or farre off from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth;</p>
<p>7 Thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither shall thine eye pitie him, neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt thou conceale him:</p>
<p>8 But thou shalt surely kill him; thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people.</p>
<p>9 And thou shalt stone him with stones, that he die; because he hath sought to thrust thee away from the Dominus thy Deus, which brought thee out of the land of Aegyptus, from the house of servitudo.</p>
<p>10 And all Israel shall heare, and feare, and shall doe no more any such wickednesse as this is among you.</p>
<p>11 If thou shalt heare say in one of thy cities, which the Dominus thy Deus hath given thee to dwel in, saying,</p>
<p>12 Certaine children of Belial are gone out from among you, and have withdrawen the inhabitants of their citie, saying, Let us goe and serve other deitates, which ye have not knowne;</p>
<p>13 Thou shalt enquire, and make search, and aske diligently; and behold, if it be trueth, and the thing certaine, that such abomination is wrought among you;</p>
<p>14 Thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that citie with the edge of the sword, destroying it utterly, and all that is therein, and the cattell thereof, with the edge of the sword.</p>
<p>15 And thou shalt gather all the spoile of it into the midst of the street thereof, and shalt burne with fire the citie, and all the spoile thereof every whit, for the Dominus thy Deus: and it shall be an heape for ever; it shall not be built againe.</p>
<p>16 And there shall cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine hand: that the Dominus may turne from the fiercenesse of his anger, and shew thee mercy, and have compassion upon thee, and multiply thee, as he hath sworne unto thy fathers;</p>
<p>17 When thou shalt hearken to the voyce of the Dominus thy Deus, to keepe all his Commandamenta, which I commande thee this day, to doe that which is right in the eyes of the Dominus thy Deus.</p>
