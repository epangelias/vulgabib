                    <p>And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and pitched beside Ebenezer: and the Philistines pitched in Aphek.</p>
<p>And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines: and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand homines.</p>
<p>And when the homines were come into the castra, the elders of Israel said, Why hath the Domini smitten us to day before the Philistines? Let us fetch the arca Domini out of Silo, that, when it cometh among us, it may save us out of the manus of our inimici.</p>
<p>So the homines sent to Silo, that they might bring from thence the arca foederis Domini exercituum, which dwelleth between the cherubim: and the two filii of Heli, Ophni and Phinees, were there with the arca foederis Dei.</p>
<p>And when the arca foederis Domini came into the castra, all Israel shouted with a great clamor, so that the terra rang again.</p>
<p>And when the Philistines heard the clamor, they said, What meaneth the great clamor in the castra of the Hebraei? And they understood that the arca Domini was come into the castra.</p>
<p>And the Philistines were timidi; for they said, Deus is come into the castra. And they said, Woe unto us! for there hath not been such a thing heretofore.</p>
<p>Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the manus of these potentissimi Dei? these are the Dei that smote the Aegyptii with omni plaga in deserto.</p>
<p>Harden your mentes, and be viri, and fight ye not as fugitivi, lest ye perish before your inimici.</p>
<p>And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every homo to his tabernaculum: and there was a magnus strages, for there fell of Israel thirty thousand pedites.</p>
<p>And the arca Dei was taken; and the two filii of Heli, Ophni and Phinees, were mortui.</p>
<p>And there ran a homo of Benjamin out of the exercitus, and came to Silo the same die, with his vestes rent, and terra upon his caput.</p>
<p>And when he came, lo, Heli sat upon a sella by the via, watching: for his cor was timidi for the arca Dei. And when the homo came he told it in the civitas, and all the civitas cried out.</p>
<p>And when Heli heard the clamor of the clamor, he said, What meaneth the noise of this clamor? And the homo hasted, and came and told Heli.</p>
<p>And the homo said unto Heli, I am he that came out of the exercitus, and I fled to day out of the exercitus. And Heli said, What is there done, my filius?</p>
<p>And the messenger answered and said, Israel fled before the Philistines, and there hath been also a magnus strages among the populus, and thy two filii also, Ophni and Phinees, are mortui, and the arca Dei is taken.</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when he made mention of the arca Dei, that Heli fell from off the sella backward by the side of the porta, and his collum was fractus, and he mortuus: for he was senex, and crassus. And he had judged Israel forty annos.</p>
