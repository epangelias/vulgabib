                    <p>In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him, Thus saith Dominus, Set thine house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live.</p>
<p>Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto Dominus, saying, I beseech thee, O Dominus, remember now how I have walked before thee in veritas and with a perfect cor, and have done that which is bonus in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.</p>
<p>And it came to pass, afore Isaiah was gone out into the middle court, that the word of Dominus came to him, saying, Turn again, and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people, Thus saith Dominus, the Deus of David thy pater, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will heal thee: on the third day thou shalt go up unto the domus of Dominus.</p>
<p>And I will add unto thy dies fifteen annos: and I will deliver thee and this civitas out of the hand of the king of Assyria: and I will defend this civitas for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.</p>
<p>And Isaiah said, Take a lump of figs. And they took and laid it on the boil, and he recovered.</p>
<p>And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, What shall be the sign that Dominus will heal me, and that I shall go up into the domus of Dominus the third day?</p>
<p>And Isaiah said, This sign shalt thou have of Dominus, that Dominus will do the thing that he hath spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees?</p>
<p>And Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees: nay, but let the shadow return backward ten degrees.</p>
<p>And Isaiah the prophet cried unto Dominus: and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the scala of Ahaz.</p>
<p>The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and was recovered of his sickness:</p>
<p>I said in the cutting off of my dies, I shall go to the portae of Sheol: I am deprived of the residuum of my annos.</p>
<p>I said, I shall not see Jah, Jah in the terra of the living: I shall behold homo no more with the inhabitants of the mundus.</p>
<p>Mine habitation is plucked up and is removed from me as a pastor's tent: I have cut off like a weaver my vita: he will cut me off with pining sickness: from day even to noctis wilt thou make an end of me.</p>
<p>I reckoned till morning, that, as a lion, so will he break all my ossa: from day even to noctis wilt thou make an end of me.</p>
<p>Like a crane or a swallow, so did I chatter: I did mourn as a dove: mine oculi fail with looking upward: O Dominus, I am oppressed; undertake for me.</p>
<p>What shall I say? he hath both spoken unto me, and himself hath done it: I shall go softly all my annos in the bitterness of my animus.</p>
<p>O Dominus, by these things men live, and in all these things is the vita of my spirit: so wilt thou recover me, and make me to live.</p>
<p>Behold, for pacem I had great bitterness: but thou hast in love to my animus delivered it from the pit of corruption: for thou hast cast all my peccata behind thy back.</p>
<p>For the sepulchre cannot confess thee: death cannot praise thee: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy veritas.</p>
<p>The living, the living, he shall confess thee, as I do this day: the pater to the filii shall make known thy fides.</p>
<p>Jah, by these things men live, and in all these things is the vita of my spirit: so wilt thou recover me, and make me to live.</p>
<p>Hezekiah also had said, What is this sign that I shall go up to the domus of Dominus?</p>
<p>Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, Hear the word of Dominus.</p>
<p>Behold, the dies come, that all that is in thy domus, and that which thy patres have laid up in store unto this day, shall be carried into Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith Dominus.</p>
<p>And of thy filii that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palatium of the king of Babylon.</p>
<p>Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, Good is the word of Dominus which thou hast spoken. And he said, Is it not good, if pacem and veritas be in my dies?</p>
