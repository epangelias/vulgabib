                    <p>And as Jesus passed by, He saw a man which was blind from his nativitas, who sat and begged.</p>
<p>And His disciples asked Him, saying, Rabbi, quis peccavit, this man, or his parentes, that he was born caecus?</p>
<p>Jesus answered, Neither hath this man peccavit, nor his parentes: but that the opera of God should be manifest in him.</p>
<p>I must work the opera of Him that sent me, while it is dies: for when nox is come, no man can operari.</p>
<p>As long as I am in the mundus, I am the lux mundi.</p>
<p>When He had thus spoken, He spat on the terra, and made clay of the spittle, and He anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,</p>
<p>And said unto him, Vade, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretatio, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.</p>
<p>The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was caecus, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?</p>
<p>Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I am he.</p>
<p>Therefore said they unto him, Quomodo were thine eyes opened?</p>
<p>He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Vade, wash in the pool of Siloam: and I went and washed, and received visus.</p>
<p>Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.</p>
<p>They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.</p>
<p>And it was sabbatum when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.</p>
<p>Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his visus. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do video.</p>
<p>Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbatum. Others said, How can a man that is peccator do such signa? And there was a divisio among them.</p>
<p>They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a propheta.</p>
<p>The Iudaei did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his visus, until they called the parentes of him that had received his visus.</p>
<p>And they asked them, saying, Is this your filius, who ye say was born caecus? how then doth he now see?</p>
<p>His parentes answered them and said, We know that this is our filius, and that he was born caecus:</p>
<p>But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.</p>
<p>These words spake his parentes, because they feared the Iudaei: for the Iudaei had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christus, he should be put out of the synagoga.</p>
<p>Therefore said his parentes, He is of age; ask him.</p>
<p>Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the gloriam: we know that this man is a peccator.</p>
<p>He answered and said, Whether he be a peccator or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was caecus, now I see.</p>
<p>Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?</p>
<p>He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his discipuli?</p>
<p>Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his discipulus; but we are Moysis discipuli.</p>
<p>We know that God spake unto Moysis: as for this fellow, we know not from whence he is.</p>
<p>The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a mirabilis thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes.</p>
<p>Now we know that God heareth not peccatores: but if any man be a cultor of God, and doth voluntas ejus, him he heareth.</p>
<p>Since the mundus began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born caecus.</p>
<p>If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.</p>
<p>They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in peccatis, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.</p>
<p>Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Believest thou in the Filium Dei?</p>
<p>He answered and said, Who is he, Domine, that I might believe in him?</p>
<p>And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.</p>
<p>And he said, Domine, I believe. And he worshipped him.</p>
<p>And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this mundus, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made caeci.</p>
<p>And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also?</p>
<p>Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no peccatum: but now ye say, We see; therefore your peccatum remaineth.</p>
