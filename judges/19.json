  "It came to pass in those veritas that the children of Israel had not a rege, and every homo did that which was rectus in his own oculus.",
  "And there was a homo of montes Ephraim, a Levite, and his uxor was of the filiae of Benjamin.",
  "And his uxor did z zelare contra eum, and she returned to the domus of her pater in Beth-lehem-judah, and she remained there for the space of quattuor menses.",
  "And her vir rose up, and followed her to speak ad cor ejus, and to reduce eam ad se: and he had with him his puer and a pair of asini: and she brought him to the domus of her pater: and the pater of the puella saw him, and rejoiced to meet him.",
  "And his socer, the pater of the puella, detained him: and he remained with him for the space of tres dies: so they did eat and drink, and lodged there.",
  "And it came to pass on the quarta die, that he rose up early in the mane, and prepared to depart: and the pater of the puella said to his gener, 'Tarry for a little while, I pray thee, and comfort thy cor with a little cibus'.",
  "And they sat down, and did eat and drink both of them together: for the pater of the puella said to the vir, 'Tarry for a little while, I pray thee'.",
  "And the vir rose up to depart, but his socer urgeb him to tarry: and he lodged there again.",
  "And he rose up early in the mane of the quinta die to depart: and the pater of the puella said, 'Comfort thy cor, I pray thee. And they tarried until after medius dies, and they did eat together.",
  "And the vir rose up to depart with his uxor and his puer: and his socer the pater of the puella said to him, 'Behold now, the day draweth toward vesper, I pray thee tarry all night, behold the day groweth toward vesper, tarry here that we may rejoice together.'",
  "But the vir would not tarry that night, but he rose up and departed, and came over contra Jebus, which is Jerusalem: and there were with him a pair of asini saddled, his uxor also was with him.",
  "When they were near Jebus, the die was far spent, and the puer said to his domine, 'Come, I pray thee, and let us turn in into this civitas of the Jebusites, and lodge there'.",
  "And his domine said to him, 'We will not turn in to the civitas of alienigenas, which is not of the filii of Israel; we will pass over to Gabaa'.",
  "And he said to his puer, 'Come, and let us draw near to one of those places to lodge in Gibea, or in Rama'.",
  "So they passed over, and went their way; and the sol descended upon them near Gabaa, which is in the possessio of Benjamin.",
  "And they turned aside thither, to go in to lodge in Gibea: and when he went in, he sat down in a platea of the civitas: for there was no homo that took them into his domus to lodge.",
  "And, behold, there came an old homo from his opus out of the ager in the vespere, which was also of montes Ephraim; and he sojourned in Gabaa, but the hommes of the locus were of the filii of Benjamin.",
  "And when he had lifted up his oculi, he saw a viator in a platea of the civitas: and the old homo said, 'Whither goest thou? and whence comest thou?'",
  "And he said to him, 'We are of Bethlehem-judah, and we go to the farther part of montes Ephraim; for I have there the quintam partem of my possessio, and I went to offer sacrificium in the domus of the Dei, and I had not a domus to receive me.",
  "And the old homo said, 'Peace be with thee; but let me provide for all thy necessaria, only, I pray thee, lodge not in the platea'.",
  "So he brought him to his domus, and gave fenum to the asinis: and they washed their pedes, and ate and drank.",
  "As they were making their cor glad, behold, the hommes of the civitas, sons of Belial, beset the domus round about, and beat at the ostium, and spake to the old homo the domine of the domus, saying, 'Bring forth the vir that came into thy domus, that we may noscere eum'.",
  "And the vir the domine of the domus went out to them, and said to them, 'No, fratres, no, I pray you, do not this malum: seeing that this vir is come into mine domus, do not this stultitia'.",
  "Behold, here is my filia a puella, and his uxor; let me bring them out now, and humble ye them, and do with them as bonum est in your oculus: but to this vir do not this stultitia.",
  "But the hommes would not hearken to the vocem of the old homo, so the vir took his uxor, and brought her forth to them; and they noscere her, and abused her all the nocte until mane, and when the diluculum began to apparere, they let her go.",
  "Then came the mulier in the mane, and fell down at the ostium of the domus of the vir, and lay there until it was mane.",
  "And her vir rose up in the mane to open the ostium, and went out to go his way: and behold, the mulier his uxor lay at the ostium of the domus, and her manus were upon the limine.",
  "And he said to her, 'Up, and let us go.' But none answered: then he took her up upon the asinus, and the vir went his way, and returned to his domus.",
  "And when he was come into his domus, he took a cultellus, and laid hold on his uxor, and divided her, with her ossa, into duodecim partes, and sent her into all the coasts of Israel.",
  "And it was so, that every unus that saw it said, 'There was no such casus in Israel from the die that the filii of Israel came out of Egypt even until this die, consider it, take consilium, and speak'.",
  "Then all the filii of Israel went out, and the congregatio was gathered together as una homo from Dan even to Beer-sheba, with the terra of Gilead, unto the Dei in Mizpeh.",
  "And the chief of all the populus, even of all the tribus of Israel, presented themselves in the congregatio of the populus of Dei, four hundred thousand pedes, that drew mensuram gladii.",
  "Now therefore deliver us the hommes of Gabaa, that we may put them to morte, and put away malum from Israel.' But the filii of Benjamin would not hearken to the vocem of their fratres the filii of Israel:",
  "And the filii of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the civitates to Gabaa, to go out to battle contra the filii of Israel.",
  "And the filii of Benjamin were numerati in die illo twenty and sex mille viatores, and out of the civitates of Gabaa seven hundred electi hommes.",
  "Among all this populus there were seven hundred electi hommes left-handed; every unus could sling stones at a capillum, and not miss.",
  "And the hommes of Israel, beside Benjamin, were numerati four hundred thousand hommes that drew mensuram gladii: all these were hommes of war.",
  "And the filii of Israel arose, and went up to the domus of the Dei, and asked consilium of Dei, and said, 'Which of us shall go up first to the battle contra the filii of Benjamin?' And the Dei said, 'Judah shall go up first.'",
  "And the filii of Israel rose up in the mane, and encamped contra Gabaa.",
  "And the vir of Israel went out to battle contra Benjamin; and the vir of Israel set themselves in array to fight contra them at Gabaa.",
  "And the filii of Benjamin came forth out of Gabaa, and destroyed down of the filii of Israel in die illo twenty and duo mille hommes.",
  "And the populus the filii of Israel were strengthened, and set themselves in array again in the loco where they set themselves in array the first die.",
  "And the filii of Israel went up and wept before the Dei until vespere, and asked consilium of Dei, saying, 'Shall I go up again to battle contra the filii of Benjamin fratres meos?' And the Dei said, 'Go up contra them.'",
  "And the filii of Israel went up contra the filii of Benjamin the secundus die.",
  "And Benjamin went out contra them out of Gabaa the secundus die, and destroyed down of the filii of Israel eighteen mille hommes; all these drew mensuram gladii.",
  "And all the filii of Israel, and all the populus, went up, and came to the domus of the Dei, and wept, and sat there before the Dei, and fasted that die until vespere, and offered holocaustum and pacifici before the Dei.",
  "And the filii of Israel asked consilium of Dei (for the arca foederis of Dei was there in die illa, and Phinees, the filius of Eleazar, the filius of Aaron, stood before it in die illa), saying, 'Shall I yet again go out to battle contra the filii of Benjamin fratres meos, or shall I cedere?' And the Dei said, 'Go up; for tomorrow I will deliver them in manus tua.'",
  "And Israel set the insidiatores round about Gabaa.",
  "And the filii of Israel went up contra the filii of Benjamin tertius die, and set themselves in array contra Gabaa, as the other times.",
  "And the filii of Benjamin went out contra them out of Gabaa tertius die also, and there were eighteen mille hommes of the filii of Israel destroyed, and fell to the terra; all these drew mensuram gladii.",
  "And the filii of Israel arose, and went up to Gabaa tertius die.",
  "And the filii of Israel set the insidiatores round about Gabaa, and they went out of their loca, they out of Gabaa tertius die, as the other times, and fought contra the filii of Israel in the ager.",
  "And the filii of Benjamin said, 'They fall before us, as the first tempus.' But the filii of Israel said, 'Let us flee, and draw them away from the civitas unto the viae'.",
  "And all the hommes of Benjamin pursued after them, and the battle was violent against them of Gabaa; and they knew not that malum was nigh them.",
  "And they turned their dorso before the filii of Israel in the via which leadeth them to the deserto; but the battle destroyed the civitas; and they pursued the filii of Benjamin, and slew them with the edge of the gladius.",
  "Now the filii of Israel had set the insidiatores round about Gabaa, and they went out of their loca, and destroyed Gabaa with the edge of the gladius.",
  "And there fell of Benjamin eighteen mille hommes, all these were strong and robusti viri of war;",
  "And turned their dorso to flee towards the deserto to the petra of Rimmmon, and they gleaned of them in the viae five mille hommes; and pursued hard after them to Gidom, and slew duo mille hommes of them;",
  "So that all which fell that die of Benjamin were twenty and quinque mille hommes that drew mensuram gladii: all these were strong and robusti viri of war;",
  "But sex hundred hommes turned their dorso, and fled to the deserto unto the petra Rimmmon, and they dwelt there for the space of quattuor menses.",
  "And the hommes of Israel turned back to the filii of Benjamin, and put them to morte with the edge of the gladius, as well as beastiam as man, even all they found: likewise they set the ignem against all the civitates which they found."
