  "And I saw an angel descending from caelum, having the clavem of the abyss and a great chain in his hand.",
  "He laid hold on the draconem, that old serpent, qui est Diabolus et Satanas, and bound him a thousand anni.",
  "And cast him into the abyss, and shut him up, and set a sigillum upon him, that he should deceive the gentes no more, till the thousand anni should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.",
  "And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and iudicium was given unto them: and I saw the animae of them that were beheaded for the testimonium of Iesus, and for the word of Deus, and which had not worshipped the bestiam, neither his imago, nor had received his character upon their foreheads or in their manus.",
  "And they lived and regnaverunt with Christ a thousand anni.",
  "But the rest of the mortui lived not again until the thousand anni were finished. This is the prima resurrectio.",
  "Blessed and sanctus is he that hath part in the prima resurrectio: on such the secunda mors hath no potestas, but they shall be sacerdotes of Deus and of Christ, and shall regnare with him a thousand anni.",
  "And when the thousand anni shall be complete, Satanas shall be loosed out of his carcer.",
  "And shall go out to deceive the gentes which are in the quattuor anguli of the terra, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battles, whose numerus is as the arena of the mari.",
  "And they went up on the breadth of the terra, and compassed the castra of the sancti, and the beloved civitas: and fire came down from Deus out of caelum, and devoured them.",
  "And the diabolus that deceived them was cast into the stagnum of ignis and sulphur, where the bestia and the false propheta are, and shall be tormented die ac nocte in saecula saeculorum.",
  "And I saw a novum caelum and a nova terra: for the prima caelum and the prima terra were passed away; and there was no more mari.",
  "And I, Iohn, saw the sancta civitas, novam Ierusalem, coming down from Deus out of caelum, prepared as a sponsa adorned for her sponsus.",
  "And I heard a great voice out of the throne, saying, Behold, the tabernaculum of Deus is with homines, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his populus, and Deus himself shall be with them, and be their Deus.",
  "And Deus shall wipe away all lacrimae from their oculi; and there shall be no more mors, neither sorrow, nor clamor, nor dolor anymore: for the former things are passed away.",
  "And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things nova. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are fideles and veraces.",
  "And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the principium and the finis. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fons aquae vitae freely.",
  "He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his Deus, and he shall be my filius.",
  "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the stagnum of ignis and sulphur, which is the secunda mors.",
  "And I saw no templum therein: for the Lord Deus Omnipotens is the templum thereof, and the Agnus.",
  "And the civitas had no need of the sol, neither of the luna, to shine in it: for the claritas of Deus did lighten it, and the Agnus is the lamp thereof.",
  "And the gentes of them that are saved shall walk in the lumine of it: and the reges of the terra bring their gloria and honor into it.",
  "And the portae of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall be no night there.",
  "And they shall bring the gloria and honor of the gentes into it.",
  "And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a mendacium: but they which are written in the liber vitae of the Agnus."
