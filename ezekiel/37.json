  "The hand of the Lord was upon me, and carried me out in the spirit of the Lord, and set me down in the midst of the valles, which was full of magnificus ossa.",
  "And caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, there were very many in the aperta valles; and, lo, they were very dry.",
  "And he said unto me, Son of homo, can these ossa live? And I answered, O Lord God, thou knowest.",
  "Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon these ossa, and say unto them, O ye ossa, hear the word of the Lord.",
  "Thus saith the Lord God unto these ossa; Behold, I will cause spiritus to enter into you, and ye shall live:",
  "And I will put nervus upon you, and will bring up caro upon you, and cover you with cutis, and put spiritus in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I am the Lord.",
  "So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a commotio, and the ossa came together, ossum to ossum.",
  "And when I beheld, lo, the nervus and the caro came up upon them, and the cutis covered them above: but there was no spiritus in them.",
  "Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the spiritus, prophesy, son of homo, and say to the spiritus, Thus saith the Lord God; Come from the quattuor venti, O spiritus, and breathe upon these interfecti, that they may live.",
  "So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the spiritus entered into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their pedes, an exceeding great exercitus.",
  "Then he said unto me, Son of homo, these ossa are the whole domus of Israel: behold, they say, Our ossa are dry, and our spes is lost: we are cut off for ourselve.",
  "Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God; Behold, O my populus, I will open your sepulchra, and cause you to come up out of your sepulchra, and bring you into the terra of Israel.",
  "And ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I have opened your sepulchra, and brought you up out of your sepulchra, O my populus.",
  "And shall put my spiritus in you, and ye shall live, and I shall place you in your own terra: then shall ye know that I the Lord have spoken it, and performed it, saith the Lord.",
  "The word of the Lord came again unto me, saying, Moreover, thou son of homo, take thee one lignum, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the filii of Israel his socii:",
  "then take another lignum, and write upon it, For Joseph, the lignum of Ephraim, and for all the domus of Israel his socii:",
  "and join them one to another into one lignum; and they shall become one in thine manus.",
  "And when the filii of thy populus shall speak unto thee, saying, Wilt thou not shew us what thou meanest by these?",
  "Say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I will take the lignum of Joseph, which is in the manus of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his socii, and will put them with him, even with the lignum of Judah, and make them one lignum, and they shall be one in mine manus.",
  "And the ligna upon which thou writest shall be in thine manus before their oculi.",
  "Say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I will take the filii of Israel from among the gentes, whither they be gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own terra:",
  "and I will make them one gens in the terra upon the montes of Israel; and one rex shall be rex to them all: and they shall be no more two gentes, neither shall they be divided into two regna any more at all.",
  "Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idola, nor with their abominationes, nor with any of their transgressiones: but I will save them out of all their habitationes, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my populus, and I will be their Deus.",
  "And David my servus shall be their rex; and they all shall have one pastor: they shall also walk in my judicia, and observe my statuta, and do them.",
  "And they shall dwell in the terra that I have given unto Jacob my servus, wherein your patres have dwelt; and they shall dwell therein, even they, and their filii, and their filiorum filii for ever: and my servus David shall be their prince for ever.",
  "Moreover I will make a foedus of pacem with them; it shall be an aeternum foedus with them: and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuarium in the midst of them for evermore.",
  "My tabernaculum also shall be with them: yea, I will be their Deus, and they shall be my populus.",
  "And the gentes shall know that I the Lord do sanctify Israel, when my sanctuarium shall be in the midst of them for evermore."
