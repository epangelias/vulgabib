  "When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron, ubi erat hortus, where he entered into, and his disciples.",
  "And Judas also, qui tradidit eum, knew the place: because Jesus ofttimes resorted thither cum suis discipulis.",
  "Judas then, having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, venit illuc cum lanternis, and torches, and weapons.",
  "Jesus therefore, knowing all things that were to come to him, exiit in occursum eorum, and said to them, Quem quaeritis?",
  "They answered him, Jesum Nazarenum. Jesus saith to them, Ego sum. And Judas also, qui tradidit eum, stood with them.",
  "As soon then as he had said to them, Ego sum, they went backward, and fell to the ground.",
  "Then asked he them again, Quem quaeritis? And they said, Jesum Nazarenum.",
  "Jesus answered, Dixi vobis, quia Ego sum: if therefore ye seek me, sinite hos abire: that the word might be fulfilled, which he spake, Of those whom thou gavest me have I lost none.",
  "Then Simon Petrus, having a gladius, drew it, and struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his dexteram auriculam: and the servant's name was Malchus.",
  "Then said Jesus to Petrus, Mitte gladium in vaginam. Calicem, quem dedit mihi Pater, non bibam illum?",
  "Then the band and the tribune, and the servants of the Jews, took Jesus, and bound him,",
  "And led him away to Annas first; for he was socius sacerdotis magni, and father in law to Caiaphas, qui erat pontifex of that year.",
  "Now Caiaphas was he, qui consilium dedit Judaeis, quia expedit, ut unus homo moriatur pro populo.",
  "And Simon Petrus followed Jesus, and so did another discipulus. Discipulus autem ille erat notus pontifici, and went in with Jesus into the atrium of the high priest.",
  "But Petrus stood at the door without. Then went out the other discipulus, qui erat notus pontifici, and spake to the porteria, and brought in Petrum.",
  "Then saith the porteria unto Petrus, Nonne et tu ex discipulis es hominis istius? He saith, Non.",
  "Now the servants and officers stood there, habentes prunas, quia frigus erat, and warmed themselves: and Petrus stood with them, and warmed himself.",
  "The pontifex magnus then asked Jesus of his discipuli, and of his doctrina.",
  "Jesus answered him, Ego palam locutus sum mundo: ego semper docui in synagoga, et in templo, quo omnes Judaei conveniunt: et in occulto locutus sum nihil.",
  "Why askest thou me? interroga eos, qui audierunt, quid locutus sum ipsis: ecce, hi sciunt, quae dixerim ego.",
  "Ut autem dixit hoc, unus assistens minister dedit alapam Jesu, dicens, Sic respondes pontifici?",
  "Jesus answered him, Si male locutus sum, testimonium perhibe de malo: si autem bene, quid me caedis?",
  "Annas then sent him bound unto Caiapha pontificem.",
  "And Simon Petrus stood and warmed himself. They said therefore to him, Nonne et tu ex discipulis es hominis istius? He denied it, and said, Non sum.",
  "One of the servants of the pontifex magni, cognatus ejus, cui abscidit Petrus auriculam, dicit Petro, Nonne te vidimus in horto cum eo?",
  "Then Petrus denied again: and immediately the gallus cantavit.",
  "Then led they Jesus from Caiapha to the praetorium: and it was mane. And they themselves went not into the praetorium, that they might not be defiled; but that they might eat the pascha.",
  "Pilatus then went out unto them, and said, Quam accusationem affertis adversus hominem hunc?",
  "They answered, and said to him, Si non esset hic malefactor, non tradidissemus eum tibi.",
  "Then said Pilatus to them, Take ye him, and judicate secundum legem vestram. The Jews then said to him, Nobis non est licitum interficere quemquam:",
  "That the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying, qua morte esset moriturus.",
  "Then Pilatus entered into the praetorium again, and called Jesus, and said to him, Tu es Rex Judaeorum?",
  "Jesus answered him, Dixisti tu: ego autem regnum meum non est de mundo hoc.",
  "Pilatus then said to him, Ergo Rex es tu? Jesus answered, Tu dicis, quia Rex sum. Ego in hoc natus sum, et ad hoc veni in mundum, ut testimonium perhibeam veritati: omnis, qui est ex veritate, audit vocem meam.",
  "Pilatus saith to him, Quae est veritas? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Judaeos, and saith to them, Ego nullam invenio in eo causam.",
  "At the festival the governor was wont to release unto the multitude one prisoner, quem volebant.",
  "And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.",
  "They then cried out again, saying, Non hunc, sed Barabbam. Now Barabbas was a latro.",
  "Pilatus then said to them, But whom will ye that I release unto you? Jesum, qui dicitur Christus, or Barabbam?",
  "For Pilatus knew that for invidia they had delivered him.",
  "When he was set down on the tribunal, his uxor sent to him, saying, Nihil tibi et justo illi: multa enim passa sum per visum propter eum.",
  "But the chief priests and the magistrates persuaded the multitude, ut magis Barabbam peterent.",
  "Pilatus saith to them, Quid igitur faciam vobis Jesum, qui dicitur Christus? They all say to him, Crucifige eum.",
  "Pilatus saith to them, Quid enim mali fecit? They cried out the more, Crucifige eum.",
  "And Pilatus, volens populo satisfacere, dimisit eis Barabbam, and delivered Jesus, postquam flagellasset, ut crucifigeretur.",
  "Then the soldiers, when they had taken Jesus, led him into the praetorium, and called together the whole band.",
  "And they clothed him with a purple garment, and platuerunt coronam de spinis, and put it on his caput.",
  "And began to salute him, Ave Rex Judaeorum.",
  "And they gave him alapas.",
  "Then came Jesus forth, wearing the corona de spinis, and the purple garment. And Pilatus saith to them, Ecce Homo.",
  "When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucifige, crucifige. Pilatus saith to them, Take ye him, and crucifige: ego enim non invenio in eo causam.",
  "The Judaei then answered him, Nos legem habemus, et secundum legem debet mori, quia se Filium Dei fecit.",
  "When Pilatus therefore heard this word, he feared the more.",
  "And he entered into the praetorium again, and saith to Jesus, Unde es tu? But Jesus gave him no answer.",
  "Then saith Pilatus to him, Nonne mihi loqueris? non scis, quia potestatem habeo crucifigere te, et potestatem habeo dimittere te?",
  "Jesus answered him, Non haberes potestatem adversum me ullam, nisi tibi esset data a Deo: propterea, qui me tradidit tibi, majus peccatum habet.",
  "From henceforth Pilatus sought to release him: but the Judaei cried out, saying, Si hunc dimittis, non es amicus Caesaris: omnis, qui se regem facit, adversarius est Caesaris.",
  "Pilatus then heard this word, and led Jesus out, and sat down in the tribunal, in loco, qui dicitur Lithostrotos, and in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.",
  "And it was parasceve of the pascha, and about the sexta hora: and he saith to the Judaeis, Ecce Rex vester.",
  "They then cried out, Tolle, tolle, crucifige eum. Pilatus saith to them, Regem vestrum crucifigam? The chief priests answered, Non habemus regem, nisi Caesarem.",
  "Then therefore he delivered him to them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him away.",
  "And he bearing his crux, went forth into a place called Calvaria, but in the Hebrew, Golgotha:"
