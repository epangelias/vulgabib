  "There are two ways, one of life and one of death, and there is a great difference between the two ways.",
  "The way of life, then, is this: First, thou shalt love God who made thee; second, thy neighbour as thyself; and all things whatsoever thou wouldst not have befal thee, do them not to another.",
  "But the way of death is this: First, it is evil and full of a curse, murders, adulteries, lusts, fornications, thefts, idolatries, magic arts, witchcrafts, rivalries, strife, jealousy, wrath, factions, dissensions, heresies, envyings, drunkenness, carousings, and other things like these.",
  "If any one can render a greater service, he is worthy of double honour, especially if he is innocent; for he that speaketh, serveth not himself, but him that speaketh to him.",
  "But he that hath the word of knowledge, let him speak to the edification of the hearer, that he that receiveth the word may be edified thereby.",
  "Blessed is he that speaketh the word of the Lord; for he that speaketh, receiveth it; but he that heareth, doth not receive it, unless he speak in the Spirit.",
  "But the speaker in the Spirit searcheth all things, even the deep things of God."
