                    <p>1 And Moses with the elders of Israel commanded the people, saying, Keep all the commandments which I command you this day.</p>
<p>2 And it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over Iordanum, that ye shall set you up great stones, and plaster them with plaster:</p>
<p>3 That thou mayest write upon them all the verba of this legis, when thou art passed over, that thou mayest go in unto the terra, which Dominus Deus thy Deus giveth thee, a terra flowing with lac and mel, as Dominus Deus of thy patres hath promised thee.</p>
<p>4 Therefore it shall be when ye be gone over Iordanum, that ye shall set up these stones, which I command you this day, in monte Gerizim, and thou shalt plaster them with plaster.</p>
<p>5 And there thou shalt build an altare unto Dominus Deus thy Deus, an altare of lapides: thou shalt not lift up ferrum upon them.</p>
<p>6 Thou shalt build the altare of Dominus Deus thy Deus of whole lapides: and thou shalt offer upon it holocaustum to Dominus Deus thy Deus:</p>
<p>7 And thou shalt immolare pacifica sacrificia, and shalt eat there, and shalt rejoice before Dominus Deus thy Deus.</p>
<p>8 And thou shalt write upon the lapides all the verba of this legis very plainly.</p>
<p>9 And Moses with the priestes of the tribe of Levi spake unto the filii Israel, saying, Take heed and hearken, O Israel; this day thou art become populus of Dominus Deus thy Deus.</p>
<p>10 Thou shalt therefore obey the vox of Dominus Deus thy Deus, and do his mandata and statuta, which I command thee this day.</p>
<p>11 And Moses charged the people the same day, saying,</p>
<p>12 These shall stand upon monte Gerizim to bless the populus, when ye are come over Iordanum; Simeon, Levi, Iudas, Issachar, Ioseph, and Beniamin:</p>
<p>13 And these shall stand upon monte Hebal to curse; Ruben, Gad, and Aser, and Zabulon, Dan, and Nepthali.</p>
<p>14 And the Levites shall speake, and say unto all the vir of Israel with a loud vox,</p>
<p>15 Cursed be the homo that maketh any sculpture or imago, the work of the hands of the artifex, and putteth it in a secret place. And all the people shall answer and say, Amen.</p>
<p>16 Cursed be he that honoureth not his pater and his mater. And all the people shall say, Amen.</p>
<p>17 Cursed be he that removeth his neighbour's terminus. And all the people shall say, Amen.</p>
<p>18 Cursed be he that maketh the caecus to wander out of the way. And all the people shall say, Amen.</p>
<p>19 Cursed be he that perverteth the iudicium of the peregrinus, of the pupillus, and of the vidua. And all the people shall say, Amen.</p>
<p>20 Cursed be he that lieth with the uxorem of his pater. And all the people shall say, Amen.</p>
<p>21 Cursed be he that lieth with any iumentum. And all the people shall say, Amen.</p>
<p>22 Cursed be he that lieth with his soror, the filia of his pater, or the filia of his mater. And all the people shall say, Amen.</p>
<p>23 Cursed be he that lieth with his mother-in-law. And all the people shall say, Amen.</p>
<p>24 Cursed be he that smiteth his proximus secretly. And all the people shall say, Amen.</p>
<p>25 Cursed be he that taketh reward to slay the innocent sanguinem. And all the people shall say, Amen.</p>
<p>26 Cursed be he that confirmeth not the verba of this legis to do them. And all the people shall say, Amen.</p>
