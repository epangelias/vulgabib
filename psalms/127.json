[
  "A Song of degrees for Solomon. Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the Lord keep the civitas, the watchman waketh but in vain.",
  "It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of dolores, for so giveth he his beloved sleep.",
  "Lo, children are an hereditas of the Lord: and the fructus of the womb is his reward.",
  "As arrows in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the iuventus.",
  "Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with inimicis in the porta.",
  "Except the Lord build the domus, they labour in vain that build it: except the Lord keep the civitas, the watchman waketh but in vain.",
  "The Lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, and even for evermore."
