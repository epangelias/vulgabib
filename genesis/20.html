                    <p>And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.</p>
<p>And Abraham said of Sarah his uxor, She is my soror: and Abimelech rex Gerar sent, and took Sarah.</p>
<p>But Deus came to Abimelech in a somnium by night, and said to him, Behold, thou art a mortuus man, for the mulier which thou hast taken; for she is uxor to a vir.</p>
<p>Now Abimelech had not approached her: and he said, Domine, wilt thou slay also a iustus nation?</p>
<p>Said he not unto me, She is my soror? and she, even she herself said, He is my frater: in the integritas of my cor, and innocencia of my manus have I done this.</p>
<p>And Deus said unto him in a somnium, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integritas of thy cor; for I also withheld thee from peccare against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.</p>
<p>Now therefore restore the uxor to the vir; for he is propheta, and he shall orare for thee, and thou shalt vivere: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt mori, thou, and all that are thine.</p>
<p>Therefore Abimelech rose early in the mane, and called all his servos, and told all these verba in their aures: and the viri were valde timidi.</p>
<p>Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, Quid fecisti nobis? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my regnum a grande peccare? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.</p>
<p>And Abimelech said unto Abraham, Quid videbas, that thou hast done this res?</p>
<p>And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the timor Dei is not in this loco; and they will interficere me for the causa of my uxor.</p>
<p>And yet indeed she is my soror; she is the filia of my pater, but not the filia of my mater; and she became my uxor.</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when Deus caused me to wander from my patris domus, that I said unto her, This is thy pietas which thou shalt shew unto me; at every loco whither we shall come, say of me, He is my frater.</p>
<p>And Abimelech took ovem, and bovem, and servos, and ancillas, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored unto him Sarah his uxor.</p>
<p>And Abimelech said, Ecce, my terra is before thee; dwell where it pleaseth thee.</p>
<p>And unto Sarah he said, Ecce, I have given thy frater mille argenteos; behold, he is to thee as a velamen oculi, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproba.</p>
<p>So Abraham oravit unto Deus: and Deus healed Abimelech, and his uxor, and his ancillas; and they bare filios.</p>
<p>For Jehovah had clausum every vulva of the domus Abimelech, on account of Sarah uxor Abraham.</p>
