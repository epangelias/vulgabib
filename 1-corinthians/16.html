                    <p>1 Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye.</p>
<p>2 Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come.</p>
<p>3 And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Ierusalem.</p>
<p>4 And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me.</p>
<p>5 Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia.</p>
<p>6 And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go.</p>
<p>7 For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Dominus permit.</p>
<p>8 But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.</p>
<p>9 For a great and effectual porta is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries.</p>
<p>10 Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he worketh the opera Dei, as I also do.</p>
<p>11 Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in pace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren.</p>
<p>12 As touching our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren: but his voluntas was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have opportunum.</p>
<p>13 Vigilate, stand fast in the fide, quit you like viri, be fortes.</p>
<p>14 Let all your actions be done in caritas.</p>
<p>15 I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the primafructa of Achaia, and that they have addicted themselves to the ministerium of the saints,)</p>
<p>16 That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with us, and laboureth.</p>
<p>17 I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied.</p>
<p>18 For they have refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore acknowledge ye them that are such.</p>
<p>19 The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in Domino, with the ecclesia that is in their domus.</p>
<p>20 All the brethren salute you. Salute one another with a holy osculum.</p>
<p>21 The salutatio of me Paul with mine own manus.</p>
<p>22 If any man love not Dominum Iesus Christus, let him be Anathema Maranatha.</p>
<p>23 The gratia of our Dominus Iesus Christus be with you.</p>
<p>24 My caritas be with you all in Christo Iesu. Amen.</p>
