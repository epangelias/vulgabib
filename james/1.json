  "James, a servant of Deus, and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.",
  "My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;",
  "Knowing this, that the trying of your fides is the evidence of patience.",
  "But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.",
  "If any of you lack sapiencia, let him ask of Deus, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.",
  "But let him ask in fides, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.",
  "For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord;",
  "A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.",
  "Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:",
  "But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the field he shall pass away.",
  "For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.",
  "Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of vita, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.",
  "Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of Deus: for Deus cannot be tempted with malum, neither tempteth he any man:",
  "But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own cupiditas, and enticed.",
  "Then when cupiditas hath conceived, it bringeth forth peccatum; and peccatum, when it is finished, bringeth forth mortem.",
  "Do not err, my beloved brethren.",
  "Every bona gift and perfect donum is from above, and cometh down from the Pater of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.",
  "Of his own voluntas begat he us with the word of veritas, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.",
  "Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to ira:",
  "For the ira of man worketh not the justitia of Deus.",
  "Therefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of malum, and receive with meekness the ingrafted word, which is able to save your animas.",
  "But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own yourselves.",
  "For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural facies in a glass:",
  "For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.",
  "But whoso looketh into the perfect law of libertas, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.",
  "If any man among you seem to be religiosus, and bridleth not his lingua, but deceiveth his own cor, this man's religio is vain.",
  "Pure religio and undefiled before Deus and the Pater is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the mundus."
