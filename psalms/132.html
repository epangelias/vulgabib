                    <p>Lord, remember David, and all his afflictiones,</p>
<p>How he sware unto the Lord, and vowed unto the Deus of Jacob,</p>
<p>Surely I will not come into the tabernaculum of my domus, nor go up into my lectus;</p>
<p>I will not give somnus to mine oculi, or slumber to mine eyelids;</p>
<p>Until I find out a locum for the Lord, an habitation for the Deus of Jacob.</p>
<p>Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the nemus of the forest;</p>
<p>We will go into his tabernaculum: we will worship at his pedes.</p>
<p>Arise, O Lord, into thy requies: thou, and the arca of thy potentia.</p>
<p>Let thy sacerdotes be clothed with iustitia; and let thy sancti rejoice;</p>
<p>For thy servus David's sake turne not away the facies of thine unctus.</p>
<p>The Lord hath sworn in veritate unto David; he will not turne from it; Of the fructus of thy ventris will I set upon thy thronus.</p>
<p>If thy filii will keep my pactum and my testimonium that I shall teach them, their filii shall also sit upon thy thronus for evermore.</p>
<p>For the Lord hath elected Sion; he hath desired it for his habitaculum.</p>
<p>This shall be my requies for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it.</p>
<p>I will abundantly bless her victum: I will satisfie her pauperes with panis.</p>
<p>I will also clothe her sacerdotes with salvus: and her sancti shall shout for iucunditas.</p>
<p>There will I make the potentia of David to ascend: I have ordained a lucerna for mine unctus.</p>
<p>His inimici I will clothe with confusio: but upon himself shall his coronet florish.</p>
