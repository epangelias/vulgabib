  "Then Isaac sowed in that terra, and received in the same anno an hundredfold: and the Lord blessed him.",
  "And the homo was enricht, and went forward, and grew until he became very magnus:",
  "For he had possessionem of flocks, and possessionem of herds, and great store of servos: and the Philistines envied him.",
  "Now all the wells which his pater's servi had digged in the dies of Abraham his pater, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with terra.",

  "And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.",
  "And Isaac digged again the wells of agua which they had digged in the dies of Abraham his pater; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their nomina after the nomina by which his pater had called them.",
  "And Isaac's servi digged in the valley, and found there a well of living agua.",
  "And the pastores of Gerar did strive with Isaac's pastores, saying, The agua is ours: and he called the nomine of the well Esek; because they strove with him.",
  "And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he called the nomine of it Sitnah.",
  "And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the nomine of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the Lord hath made us spatium, and we shall be fruitful in the terra.",

  "And they said, We saw certainly that the Lord was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a foedus with thee;",
  "That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in pace: thou art now the blessed of the Lord.",

  "And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in pace.",
  "And it came to pass the same die, that Isaac's servi came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found agua.",
