                    <p>Remember, O Domine, what is come upon us: consider, and behold our reproach.</p>
<p>Our inheritance is turned to strangers, our houses to aliens, from the matriarcha to the end.</p>
<p>We are orphans and fatherless, our matres are as widows.</p>
<p>We have drunken our water for argentum, our wood is sold unto us.</p>
<p>Our necks are under persecution: we labour, and have no rest.</p>
<p>Aegyptus gave, and Assyria, to satisfy our necessities.</p>
<p>Our patres have sinned, and are not; and we have borne their iniquitates.</p>
<p>Servi have ruled over us: there is none that doth deliver us out of their manu.</p>
<p>We gathere our panis with the peril of our vita: from the facies of the sword in the deserta.</p>
<p>Our pelles was black like an oven because of the vehement flames of the famine.</p>
<p>They ravished the mulieres in Sion, and the virgines in the civitates of Judah, and the reginas by the manu of the hostis.</p>
<p>Principes were hanged up by their manu: the facies of the seniores were not honoured.</p>
<p>They took the iuvenes to the mola, and the pueri fell under the ligna: the seniores have ceased from the porta, and the iuvenes from their cantico.</p>
<p>The gaudium of our corda hath ceased; our saltatio is turned into luctus.</p>
<p>The corona of our capite is fallen: vae nunc nobis, quia peccavimus.</p>
<p>Therefore our corde hath fallen, and our oculi are dim, because of montis Sion, because it is desolatus.</p>
<p>The vulpes walked upon it, to make it desolatus.</p>
<p>But thou, O Domine, sabis in aeternum: thy thronus is in generatione et generationem.</p>
<p>Why dost thou forget us for ever, and forsake us so long time?</p>
<p>Turn thou us unto thee, O Domine, and we shall be converted: renew our dies as of old.</p>
<p>But thou hast rejected us; thou hast put us to death, and wilt not be pacificus.</p>
<p>Thou hast covered us with indignation, and persecuted us: thou hast slain, neither hast thou spared.</p>
<p>Thou hast set a cloud before thy facies, that our oration may not pass through.</p>
<p>Thou hast made us as the scoria of the terra, and as the sterquilinium in medio populorum.</p>
<p>Thou hast made us a byword among the gentes, a hissing and a derisio among the populi.</p>
<p>All our dies are passed away in thy indignation: we have consummated our anni in thy ira.</p>
<p>Turn thou us, O Domine, unto thee, and we shall be converted: renew our dies as of old.</p>
<p>Unless thou hast utterly rejected us, and art angry with us beyond mesure.</p>
