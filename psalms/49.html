                    <p>Hear this, all ye nations: give ear, all ye inhabitants of the terra,</p>
<p>Both low and high, rich and poor, together.</p>
<p>My mouth shall speak sapientia; and the meditation of my cor shall be understanding.</p>
<p>I will incline mine aurem to a proverb: I will open my os in a riddle.</p>
<p>Wherefore should I fear in dies malorum, when the iniquity of my calceus shall compass me about?</p>
<p>They that trust in their divitiae, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;</p>
<p>None of them can by any means redimere fratrem, nor give to Deus a ransom for him:</p>
<p>For the redemption of their animus is pretiosus, and it faileth for ever;</p>
<p>That he should still vivere for ever, and not see corruptio.</p>
<p>For he seeth that sapiens and stultus die, as well as the animalia, and they all perish together, and leave their riches in the mundo.</p>
<p>Their sepulchra are domus for ever, and their habitatio from generation to generation.</p>
<p>They call their terra after their own nomina.</p>
<p>And man, being in honore, hath not understood; he is compared to animalia, and is like them.</p>
<p>This their via is folly: yet their posteritas approbat their sayings.</p>
<p>Like sheep they are laid in sepulchra; death shall feed on them; and the recti shall have dominion over them in the mane.</p>
<p>But Deus will redimere my animus from the manus of gehenna: for he shall suscipere me.</p>
<p>Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the gloria of his domus is increased;</p>
<p>For when he shall mori, he shall not take anything away with him; his gloria shall not descend with him.</p>
<p>Though while he lived, he blessed his animus; and men will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself.</p>
<p>He shall go to the generation of his patres; they shall never see lumen.</p>
<p>Man that is in honore, and hath not intellectum, is compared to animalia, and is like them.</p>
