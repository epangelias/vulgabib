  "Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying, 'Thus saith Cyrus rex of Persia, The Lord Deus of heaven hath given me all the regna of the earth; and he hath charged me to build him an aedes in Jerusalem, which is in Judaea.'",
  "Who is there among you of all his populus, whose Deus be with him, let him go up to Jerusalem in Judaea, and build the aedes of the Lord Deus of Israel (he is the Deus,) which is in Jerusalem.",
  "And whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, beside the freewill offering for the aedes of God that is in Jerusalem.",
  "Then rose up the chief of the patres of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, with all them whose spirit Deus had raised, to go up to build the aedes of the Lord which is in Jerusalem.",
  "And all they that were about them strengthened their manus upon them, that they should go.",
  "Also Cyrus the rex brought forth the vessels of the aedes of the Lord, which Nebuchadnezzar had taken forth out of Jerusalem, and had put them in the aedes of his deus.",
  "Even those did Cyrus rex take out, and delivered them unto one, whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had made pater of Judah.",
  "And said unto him, Take these vessels, go, carry them into the aedes which is in Jerusalem, and let the aedes of God be rebuilt in his loco.",
  "Then came the same Sheshbazzar, and laid the foundations of the aedes of God which is in Jerusalem: and since that time even until now hath it been in building, and yet it is not finished.",
  "Now in the first year of Cyrus rex of Persia, that the word of the Lord spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus rex of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying, 'Thus saith Cyrus rex of Persia, All the regna of the earth hath the Lord Deus of heaven given me; and he hath charged me to build him an aedes in Jerusalem, which is in Judaea.'",
  "Who is there among you of all his populus, whose Deus be with him, let him go up to Jerusalem in Judaea, and build the aedes of the Lord Deus of Israel (he is the Deus,) which is in Jerusalem.",
